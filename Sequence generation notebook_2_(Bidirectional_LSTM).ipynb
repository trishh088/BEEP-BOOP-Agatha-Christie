POIROT EXPLAINS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER I.\\nI GO TO STYLES\\n\\n\\nThe intense interest aroused in the public by what was known at the\\ntime as “The Styles Case” has now somewhat subsided. Nevertheless, in\\nview of the world-wide notoriety which attended it, I have been asked,\\nboth by my friend Poirot and the family themselves, to write an account\\nof the whole story. This, we trust, will effectually silence the\\nsensational rumours which still persist.\\n\\nI will therefore briefly set down the circumstances which led to my\\nbeing connected with the affair.\\n\\nI had been invalided home from the Front; and, after spending some\\nmonths in a rather depressing Convalescent Home, was given a month’s\\nsick leave. Having no near relations or friends, I was trying to make\\nup my mind what to do, when I ran across John Cavendish. I had seen\\nvery little of him for some years. Indeed, I had never known him\\nparticularly well. He was a good fifteen years my senior, for one\\nthing, though he hardly looked his forty-five years. As a boy, though,\\nI had often stayed at Styles, his mother’s place in Essex.\\n\\nWe had a good yarn about old times, and it ended in his inviting me\\ndown to Styles to spend my leave there.\\n\\n“The mater will be delighted to see you again—after all those years,”\\nhe added.\\n\\n“Your mother keeps well?” I asked.\\n\\n“Oh, yes. I suppose you know that she has married again?”\\n\\nI am afraid I showed my surprise rather plainly. Mrs. Cavendish, who\\nhad married John’s father when he was a widower with two sons, had been\\na handsome woman of middle-age as I remembered her. She certainly could\\nnot be a day less than seventy now. I recalled her as an energetic,\\nautocratic personality, somewhat inclined to charitable and social\\nnotoriety, with a fondness for opening bazaars and playing the Lady\\nBountiful. She was a most generous woman, and possessed a considerable\\nfortune of her own.\\n\\nTheir country-place, Styles Court, had been purchased by Mr. Cavendish\\nearly in their married life. He had been completely under his wife’s\\nascendancy, so much so that, on dying, he left the place to her for her\\nlifetime, as well as the larger part of his income; an arrangement that\\nwas distinctly unfair to his two sons. Their step-mother, however, had\\nalways been most generous to them; indeed, they were so young at the\\ntime of their father’s remarriage that they always thought of her as\\ntheir own mother.\\n\\nLawrence, the younger, had been a delicate youth. He had qualified as a\\ndoctor but early relinquished the profession of medicine, and lived at\\nhome while pursuing literary ambitions; though his verses never had any\\nmarked success.\\n\\nJohn practised for some time as a barrister, but had finally settled\\ndown to the more congenial life of a country squire. He had married two\\nyears ago, and had taken his wife to live at Styles, though I\\nentertained a shrewd suspicion that he would have preferred his mother\\nto increase his allowance, which would have enabled him to have a home\\nof his own. Mrs. Cavendish, however, was a lady who liked to make her\\nown plans, and expected other people to fall in with them, and in this\\ncase she certainly had the whip hand, namely: the purse strings.\\n\\nJohn noticed my surprise at the news of his mother’s remarriage and\\nsmiled rather ruefully.\\n\\n“Rotten little bounder too!” he said savagely. “I can tell you,\\nHastings, it’s making life jolly difficult for us. As for Evie—you\\nremember Evie?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“Oh, I suppose she was after your time. She’s the mater’s factotum,\\ncompanion, Jack of all trades! A great sport—old Evie! Not precisely\\nyoung and beautiful, but as game as they make them.”\\n\\n“You were going to say——?”\\n\\n“Oh, this fellow! He turned up from nowhere, on the pretext of being a\\nsecond cousin or something of Evie’s, though she didn’t seem\\nparticularly keen to acknowledge the relationship. The fellow is an\\nabsolute outsider, anyone can see that. He’s got a great black beard,\\nand wears patent leather boots in all weathers! But the mater cottoned\\nto him at once, took him on as secretary—you know how she’s always\\nrunning a hundred societies?”\\n\\nI nodded.\\n\\n“Well, of course the war has turned the hundreds into thousands. No\\ndoubt the fellow was very useful to her. But you could have knocked us\\nall down with a feather when, three months ago, she suddenly announced\\nthat she and Alfred were engaged! The fellow must be at least twenty\\nyears younger than she is! It’s simply bare-faced fortune hunting; but\\nthere you are—she is her own mistress, and she’s married him.”\\n\\n“It must be a difficult situation for you all.”\\n\\n“Difficult! It’s damnable!”\\n\\nThus it came about that, three days later, I descended from the train\\nat Styles St. Mary, an absurd little station, with no apparent reason\\nfor existence, perched up in the midst of green fields and country\\nlanes. John Cavendish was waiting on the platform, and piloted me out\\nto the car.\\n\\n“Got a drop or two of petrol still, you see,” he remarked. “Mainly\\nowing to the mater’s activities.”\\n\\nThe village of Styles St. Mary was situated about two miles from the\\nlittle station, and Styles Court lay a mile the other side of it. It\\nwas a still, warm day in early July. As one looked out over the flat\\nEssex country, lying so green and peaceful under the afternoon sun, it\\nseemed almost impossible to believe that, not so very far away, a great\\nwar was running its appointed course. I felt I had suddenly strayed\\ninto another world. As we turned in at the lodge gates, John said:\\n\\n“I’m afraid you’ll find it very quiet down here, Hastings.”\\n\\n“My dear fellow, that’s just what I want.”\\n\\n“Oh, it’s pleasant enough if you want to lead the idle life. I drill\\nwith the volunteers twice a week, and lend a hand at the farms. My wife\\nworks regularly ‘on the land’. She is up at five every morning to milk,\\nand keeps at it steadily until lunchtime. It’s a jolly good life taking\\nit all round—if it weren’t for that fellow Alfred Inglethorp!” He\\nchecked the car suddenly, and glanced at his watch. “I wonder if we’ve\\ntime to pick up Cynthia. No, she’ll have started from the hospital by\\nnow.”\\n\\n“Cynthia! That’s not your wife?”\\n\\n“No, Cynthia is a protégée of my mother’s, the daughter of an old\\nschoolfellow of hers, who married a rascally solicitor. He came a\\ncropper, and the girl was left an orphan and penniless. My mother came\\nto the rescue, and Cynthia has been with us nearly two years now. She\\nworks in the Red Cross Hospital at Tadminster, seven miles away.”\\n\\nAs he spoke the last words, we drew up in front of the fine old house.\\nA lady in a stout tweed skirt, who was bending over a flower bed,\\nstraightened herself at our approach.\\n\\n“Hullo, Evie, here’s our wounded hero! Mr. Hastings—Miss Howard.”\\n\\nMiss Howard shook hands with a hearty, almost painful, grip. I had an\\nimpression of very blue eyes in a sunburnt face. She was a\\npleasant-looking woman of about forty, with a deep voice, almost manly\\nin its stentorian tones, and had a large sensible square body, with\\nfeet to match—these last encased in good thick boots. Her conversation,\\nI soon found, was couched in the telegraphic style.\\n\\n“Weeds grow like house afire. Can’t keep even with ’em. Shall press you\\nin. Better be careful.”\\n\\n“I’m sure I shall be only too delighted to make myself useful,” I\\nresponded.\\n\\n“Don’t say it. Never does. Wish you hadn’t later.”\\n\\n“You’re a cynic, Evie,” said John, laughing. “Where’s tea to-day—inside\\nor out?”\\n\\n“Out. Too fine a day to be cooped up in the house.”\\n\\n“Come on then, you’ve done enough gardening for to-day. ‘The labourer\\nis worthy of his hire’, you know. Come and be refreshed.”\\n\\n“Well,” said Miss Howard, drawing off her gardening gloves, “I’m\\ninclined to agree with you.”\\n\\nShe led the way round the house to where tea was spread under the shade\\nof a large sycamore.\\n\\nA figure rose from one of the basket chairs, and came a few steps to\\nmeet us.\\n\\n“My wife, Hastings,” said John.\\n\\nI shall never forget my first sight of Mary Cavendish. Her tall,\\nslender form, outlined against the bright light; the vivid sense of\\nslumbering fire that seemed to find expression only in those wonderful\\ntawny eyes of hers, remarkable eyes, different from any other woman’s\\nthat I have ever known; the intense power of stillness she possessed,\\nwhich nevertheless conveyed the impression of a wild untamed spirit in\\nan exquisitely civilised body—all these things are burnt into my\\nmemory. I shall never forget them.\\n\\nShe greeted me with a few words of pleasant welcome in a low clear\\nvoice, and I sank into a basket chair feeling distinctly glad that I\\nhad accepted John’s invitation. Mrs. Cavendish gave me some tea, and\\nher few quiet remarks heightened my first impression of her as a\\nthoroughly fascinating woman. An appreciative listener is always\\nstimulating, and I described, in a humorous manner, certain incidents\\nof my Convalescent Home, in a way which, I flatter myself, greatly\\namused my hostess. John, of course, good fellow though he is, could\\nhardly be called a brilliant conversationalist.\\n\\nAt that moment a well remembered voice floated through the open French\\nwindow near at hand:\\n\\n“Then you’ll write to the Princess after tea, Alfred? I’ll write to\\nLady Tadminster for the second day, myself. Or shall we wait until we\\nhear from the Princess? In case of a refusal, Lady Tadminster might\\nopen it the first day, and Mrs. Crosbie the second. Then there’s the\\nDuchess—about the school fête.”\\n\\nThere was the murmur of a man’s voice, and then Mrs. Inglethorp’s rose\\nin reply:\\n\\n“Yes, certainly. After tea will do quite well. You are so thoughtful,\\nAlfred dear.”\\n\\nThe French window swung open a little wider, and a handsome\\nwhite-haired old lady, with a somewhat masterful cast of features,\\nstepped out of it on to the lawn. A man followed her, a suggestion of\\ndeference in his manner.\\n\\nMrs. Inglethorp greeted me with effusion.\\n\\n“Why, if it isn’t too delightful to see you again, Mr. Hastings, after\\nall these years. Alfred, darling, Mr. Hastings—my husband.”\\n\\nI looked with some curiosity at “Alfred darling”. He certainly struck a\\nrather alien note. I did not wonder at John objecting to his beard. It\\nwas one of the longest and blackest I have ever seen. He wore\\ngold-rimmed pince-nez, and had a curious impassivity of feature. It\\nstruck me that he might look natural on a stage, but was strangely out\\nof place in real life. His voice was rather deep and unctuous. He\\nplaced a wooden hand in mine and said:\\n\\n“This is a pleasure, Mr. Hastings.” Then, turning to his wife: “Emily\\ndearest, I think that cushion is a little damp.”\\n\\nShe beamed fondly on him, as he substituted another with every\\ndemonstration of the tenderest care. Strange infatuation of an\\notherwise sensible woman!\\n\\nWith the presence of Mr. Inglethorp, a sense of constraint and veiled\\nhostility seemed to settle down upon the company. Miss Howard, in\\nparticular, took no pains to conceal her feelings. Mrs. Inglethorp,\\nhowever, seemed to notice nothing unusual. Her volubility, which I\\nremembered of old, had lost nothing in the intervening years, and she\\npoured out a steady flood of conversation, mainly on the subject of the\\nforthcoming bazaar which she was organizing and which was to take place\\nshortly. Occasionally she referred to her husband over a question of\\ndays or dates. His watchful and attentive manner never varied. From the\\nvery first I took a firm and rooted dislike to him, and I flatter\\nmyself that my first judgments are usually fairly shrewd.\\n\\nPresently Mrs. Inglethorp turned to give some instructions about\\nletters to Evelyn Howard, and her husband addressed me in his\\npainstaking voice:\\n\\n“Is soldiering your regular profession, Mr. Hastings?”\\n\\n“No, before the war I was in Lloyd’s.”\\n\\n“And you will return there after it is over?”\\n\\n“Perhaps. Either that or a fresh start altogether.”\\n\\nMary Cavendish leant forward.\\n\\n“What would you really choose as a profession, if you could just\\nconsult your inclination?”\\n\\n“Well, that depends.”\\n\\n“No secret hobby?” she asked. “Tell me—you’re drawn to something?\\nEveryone is—usually something absurd.”\\n\\n“You’ll laugh at me.”\\n\\nShe smiled.\\n\\n“Perhaps.”\\n\\n“Well, I’ve always had a secret hankering to be a detective!”\\n\\n“The real thing—Scotland Yard? Or Sherlock Holmes?”\\n\\n“Oh, Sherlock Holmes by all means. But really, seriously, I am awfully\\ndrawn to it. I came across a man in Belgium once, a very famous\\ndetective, and he quite inflamed me. He was a marvellous little fellow.\\nHe used to say that all good detective work was a mere matter of\\nmethod. My system is based on his—though of course I have progressed\\nrather further. He was a funny little man, a great dandy, but\\nwonderfully clever.”\\n\\n“Like a good detective story myself,” remarked Miss Howard. “Lots of\\nnonsense written, though. Criminal discovered in last chapter. Everyone\\ndumbfounded. Real crime—you’d know at once.”\\n\\n“There have been a great number of undiscovered crimes,” I argued.\\n\\n“Don’t mean the police, but the people that are right in it. The\\nfamily. You couldn’t really hoodwink them. They’d know.”\\n\\n“Then,” I said, much amused, “you think that if you were mixed up in a\\ncrime, say a murder, you’d be able to spot the murderer right off?”\\n\\n“Of course I should. Mightn’t be able to prove it to a pack of lawyers.\\nBut I’m certain I’d know. I’d feel it in my fingertips if he came near\\nme.”\\n\\n“It might be a ‘she’,” I suggested.\\n\\n“Might. But murder’s a violent crime. Associate it more with a man.”\\n\\n“Not in a case of poisoning.” Mrs. Cavendish’s clear voice startled me.\\n“Dr. Bauerstein was saying yesterday that, owing to the general\\nignorance of the more uncommon poisons among the medical profession,\\nthere were probably countless cases of poisoning quite unsuspected.”\\n\\n“Why, Mary, what a gruesome conversation!” cried Mrs. Inglethorp. “It\\nmakes me feel as if a goose were walking over my grave. Oh, there’s\\nCynthia!”\\n\\nA young girl in V.A.D. uniform ran lightly across the lawn.\\n\\n“Why, Cynthia, you are late to-day. This is Mr. Hastings—Miss Murdoch.”\\n\\nCynthia Murdoch was a fresh-looking young creature, full of life and\\nvigour. She tossed off her little V.A.D. cap, and I admired the great\\nloose waves of her auburn hair, and the smallness and whiteness of the\\nhand she held out to claim her tea. With dark eyes and eyelashes she\\nwould have been a beauty.\\n\\nShe flung herself down on the ground beside John, and as I handed her a\\nplate of sandwiches she smiled up at me.\\n\\n“Sit down here on the grass, do. It’s ever so much nicer.”\\n\\nI dropped down obediently.\\n\\n“You work at Tadminster, don’t you, Miss Murdoch?”\\n\\nShe nodded.\\n\\n“For my sins.”\\n\\n“Do they bully you, then?” I asked, smiling.\\n\\n“I should like to see them!” cried Cynthia with dignity.\\n\\n“I have got a cousin who is nursing,” I remarked. “And she is terrified\\nof ‘Sisters’.”\\n\\n“I don’t wonder. Sisters _are_, you know, Mr. Hastings. They simp-ly\\n_are_! You’ve no idea! But I’m not a nurse, thank heaven, I work in the\\ndispensary.”\\n\\n“How many people do you poison?” I asked, smiling.\\n\\nCynthia smiled too.\\n\\n“Oh, hundreds!” she said.\\n\\n“Cynthia,” called Mrs. Inglethorp, “do you think you could write a few\\nnotes for me?”\\n\\n“Certainly, Aunt Emily.”\\n\\nShe jumped up promptly, and something in her manner reminded me that\\nher position was a dependent one, and that Mrs. Inglethorp, kind as she\\nmight be in the main, did not allow her to forget it.\\n\\nMy hostess turned to me.\\n\\n“John will show you your room. Supper is at half-past seven. We have\\ngiven up late dinner for some time now. Lady Tadminster, our Member’s\\nwife—she was the late Lord Abbotsbury’s daughter—does the same. She\\nagrees with me that one must set an example of economy. We are quite a\\nwar household; nothing is wasted here—every scrap of waste paper, even,\\nis saved and sent away in sacks.”\\n\\nI expressed my appreciation, and John took me into the house and up the\\nbroad staircase, which forked right and left half-way to different\\nwings of the building. My room was in the left wing, and looked out\\nover the park.\\n\\nJohn left me, and a few minutes later I saw him from my window walking\\nslowly across the grass arm in arm with Cynthia Murdoch. I heard Mrs.\\nInglethorp call “Cynthia” impatiently, and the girl started and ran\\nback to the house. At the same moment, a man stepped out from the\\nshadow of a tree and walked slowly in the same direction. He looked\\nabout forty, very dark with a melancholy clean-shaven face. Some\\nviolent emotion seemed to be mastering him. He looked up at my window\\nas he passed, and I recognized him, though he had changed much in the\\nfifteen years that had elapsed since we last met. It was John’s younger\\nbrother, Lawrence Cavendish. I wondered what it was that had brought\\nthat singular expression to his face.\\n\\nThen I dismissed him from my mind, and returned to the contemplation of\\nmy own affairs.\\n\\nThe evening passed pleasantly enough; and I dreamed that night of that\\nenigmatical woman, Mary Cavendish.\\n\\nThe next morning dawned bright and sunny, and I was full of the\\nanticipation of a delightful visit.\\n\\nI did not see Mrs. Cavendish until lunch-time, when she volunteered to\\ntake me for a walk, and we spent a charming afternoon roaming in the\\nwoods, returning to the house about five.\\n\\nAs we entered the large hall, John beckoned us both into the\\nsmoking-room. I saw at once by his face that something disturbing had\\noccurred. We followed him in, and he shut the door after us.\\n\\n“Look here, Mary, there’s the deuce of a mess. Evie’s had a row with\\nAlfred Inglethorp, and she’s off.”\\n\\n“Evie? Off?”\\n\\nJohn nodded gloomily.\\n\\n“Yes; you see she went to the mater, and—Oh,—here’s Evie herself.”\\n\\nMiss Howard entered. Her lips were set grimly together, and she carried\\na small suit-case. She looked excited and determined, and slightly on\\nthe defensive.\\n\\n“At any rate,” she burst out, “I’ve spoken my mind!”\\n\\n“My dear Evelyn,” cried Mrs. Cavendish, “this can’t be true!”\\n\\nMiss Howard nodded grimly.\\n\\n“True enough! Afraid I said some things to Emily she won’t forget or\\nforgive in a hurry. Don’t mind if they’ve only sunk in a bit. Probably\\nwater off a duck’s back, though. I said right out: ‘You’re an old\\nwoman, Emily, and there’s no fool like an old fool. The man’s twenty\\nyears younger than you, and don’t you fool yourself as to what he\\nmarried you for. Money! Well, don’t let him have too much of it. Farmer\\nRaikes has got a very pretty young wife. Just ask your Alfred how much\\ntime he spends over there.’ She was very angry. Natural! I went on,\\n‘I’m going to warn you, whether you like it or not. That man would as\\nsoon murder you in your bed as look at you. He’s a bad lot. You can say\\nwhat you like to me, but remember what I’ve told you. He’s a bad lot!’”\\n\\n“What did she say?”\\n\\nMiss Howard made an extremely expressive grimace.\\n\\n“‘Darling Alfred’—‘dearest Alfred’—‘wicked calumnies’ —‘wicked\\nlies’—‘wicked woman’—to accuse her ‘dear husband!’ The sooner I left\\nher house the better. So I’m off.”\\n\\n“But not now?”\\n\\n“This minute!”\\n\\nFor a moment we sat and stared at her. Finally John Cavendish, finding\\nhis persuasions of no avail, went off to look up the trains. His wife\\nfollowed him, murmuring something about persuading Mrs. Inglethorp to\\nthink better of it.\\n\\nAs she left the room, Miss Howard’s face changed. She leant towards me\\neagerly.\\n\\n“Mr. Hastings, you’re honest. I can trust you?”\\n\\nI was a little startled. She laid her hand on my arm, and sank her\\nvoice to a whisper.\\n\\n“Look after her, Mr. Hastings. My poor Emily. They’re a lot of\\nsharks—all of them. Oh, I know what I’m talking about. There isn’t one\\nof them that’s not hard up and trying to get money out of her. I’ve\\nprotected her as much as I could. Now I’m out of the way, they’ll\\nimpose upon her.”\\n\\n“Of course, Miss Howard,” I said, “I’ll do everything I can, but I’m\\nsure you’re excited and overwrought.”\\n\\nShe interrupted me by slowly shaking her forefinger.\\n\\n“Young man, trust me. I’ve lived in the world rather longer than you\\nhave. All I ask you is to keep your eyes open. You’ll see what I mean.”\\n\\nThe throb of the motor came through the open window, and Miss Howard\\nrose and moved to the door. John’s voice sounded outside. With her hand\\non the handle, she turned her head over her shoulder, and beckoned to\\nme.\\n\\n“Above all, Mr. Hastings, watch that devil—her husband!”\\n\\nThere was no time for more. Miss Howard was swallowed up in an eager\\nchorus of protests and good-byes. The Inglethorps did not appear.\\n\\nAs the motor drove away, Mrs. Cavendish suddenly detached herself from\\nthe group, and moved across the drive to the lawn to meet a tall\\nbearded man who had been evidently making for the house. The colour\\nrose in her cheeks as she held out her hand to him.\\n\\n“Who is that?” I asked sharply, for instinctively I distrusted the man.\\n\\n“That’s Dr. Bauerstein,” said John shortly.\\n\\n“And who is Dr. Bauerstein?”\\n\\n“He’s staying in the village doing a rest cure, after a bad nervous\\nbreakdown. He’s a London specialist; a very clever man—one of the\\ngreatest living experts on poisons, I believe.”\\n\\n“And he’s a great friend of Mary’s,” put in Cynthia, the irrepressible.\\n\\nJohn Cavendish frowned and changed the subject.\\n\\n“Come for a stroll, Hastings. This has been a most rotten business. She\\nalways had a rough tongue, but there is no stauncher friend in England\\nthan Evelyn Howard.”\\n\\nHe took the path through the plantation, and we walked down to the\\nvillage through the woods which bordered one side of the estate.\\n\\nAs we passed through one of the gates on our way home again, a pretty\\nyoung woman of gipsy type coming in the opposite direction bowed and\\nsmiled.\\n\\n“That’s a pretty girl,” I remarked appreciatively.\\n\\nJohn’s face hardened.\\n\\n“That is Mrs. Raikes.”\\n\\n“The one that Miss Howard——”\\n\\n“Exactly,” said John, with rather unnecessary abruptness.\\n\\nI thought of the white-haired old lady in the big house, and that vivid\\nwicked little face that had just smiled into ours, and a vague chill of\\nforeboding crept over me. I brushed it aside.\\n\\n“Styles is really a glorious old place,” I said to John.\\n\\nHe nodded rather gloomily.\\n\\n“Yes, it’s a fine property. It’ll be mine some day—should be mine now\\nby rights, if my father had only made a decent will. And then I\\nshouldn’t be so damned hard up as I am now.”\\n\\n“Hard up, are you?”\\n\\n“My dear Hastings, I don’t mind telling you that I’m at my wits’ end\\nfor money.”\\n\\n“Couldn’t your brother help you?”\\n\\n“Lawrence? He’s gone through every penny he ever had, publishing rotten\\nverses in fancy bindings. No, we’re an impecunious lot. My mother’s\\nalways been awfully good to us, I must say. That is, up to now. Since\\nher marriage, of course——” he broke off, frowning.\\n\\nFor the first time I felt that, with Evelyn Howard, something\\nindefinable had gone from the atmosphere. Her presence had spelt\\nsecurity. Now that security was removed—and the air seemed rife with\\nsuspicion. The sinister face of Dr. Bauerstein recurred to me\\nunpleasantly. A vague suspicion of everyone and everything filled my\\nmind. Just for a moment I had a premonition of approaching evil.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II.\\nTHE 16TH AND 17TH OF JULY\\n\\n\\nI had arrived at Styles on the 5th of July. I come now to the events of\\nthe 16th and 17th of that month. For the convenience of the reader I\\nwill recapitulate the incidents of those days in as exact a manner as\\npossible. They were elicited subsequently at the trial by a process of\\nlong and tedious cross-examinations.\\n\\nI received a letter from Evelyn Howard a couple of days after her\\ndeparture, telling me she was working as a nurse at the big hospital in\\nMiddlingham, a manufacturing town some fifteen miles away, and begging\\nme to let her know if Mrs. Inglethorp should show any wish to be\\nreconciled.\\n\\nThe only fly in the ointment of my peaceful days was Mrs. Cavendish’s\\nextraordinary, and, for my part, unaccountable preference for the\\nsociety of Dr. Bauerstein. What she saw in the man I cannot imagine,\\nbut she was always asking him up to the house, and often went off for\\nlong expeditions with him. I must confess that I was quite unable to\\nsee his attraction.\\n\\nThe 16th of July fell on a Monday. It was a day of turmoil. The famous\\nbazaar had taken place on Saturday, and an entertainment, in connection\\nwith the same charity, at which Mrs. Inglethorp was to recite a War\\npoem, was to be held that night. We were all busy during the morning\\narranging and decorating the Hall in the village where it was to take\\nplace. We had a late luncheon and spent the afternoon resting in the\\ngarden. I noticed that John’s manner was somewhat unusual. He seemed\\nvery excited and restless.\\n\\nAfter tea, Mrs. Inglethorp went to lie down to rest before her efforts\\nin the evening and I challenged Mary Cavendish to a single at tennis.\\n\\nAbout a quarter to seven, Mrs. Inglethorp called us that we should be\\nlate as supper was early that night. We had rather a scramble to get\\nready in time; and before the meal was over the motor was waiting at\\nthe door.\\n\\nThe entertainment was a great success, Mrs. Inglethorp’s recitation\\nreceiving tremendous applause. There were also some tableaux in which\\nCynthia took part. She did not return with us, having been asked to a\\nsupper party, and to remain the night with some friends who had been\\nacting with her in the tableaux.\\n\\nThe following morning, Mrs. Inglethorp stayed in bed to breakfast, as\\nshe was rather overtired; but she appeared in her briskest mood about\\n12.30, and swept Lawrence and myself off to a luncheon party.\\n\\n“Such a charming invitation from Mrs. Rolleston. Lady Tadminster’s\\nsister, you know. The Rollestons came over with the Conqueror—one of\\nour oldest families.”\\n\\nMary had excused herself on the plea of an engagement with Dr.\\nBauerstein.\\n\\nWe had a pleasant luncheon, and as we drove away Lawrence suggested\\nthat we should return by Tadminster, which was barely a mile out of our\\nway, and pay a visit to Cynthia in her dispensary. Mrs. Inglethorp\\nreplied that this was an excellent idea, but as she had several letters\\nto write she would drop us there, and we could come back with Cynthia\\nin the pony-trap.\\n\\nWe were detained under suspicion by the hospital porter, until Cynthia\\nappeared to vouch for us, looking very cool and sweet in her long white\\noverall. She took us up to her sanctum, and introduced us to her fellow\\ndispenser, a rather awe-inspiring individual, whom Cynthia cheerily\\naddressed as “Nibs.”\\n\\n“What a lot of bottles!” I exclaimed, as my eye travelled round the\\nsmall room. “Do you really know what’s in them all?”\\n\\n“Say something original,” groaned Cynthia. “Every single person who\\ncomes up here says that. We are really thinking of bestowing a prize on\\nthe first individual who does _not_ say: ‘What a lot of bottles!’ And I\\nknow the next thing you’re going to say is: ‘How many people have you\\npoisoned?’”\\n\\nI pleaded guilty with a laugh.\\n\\n“If you people only knew how fatally easy it is to poison someone by\\nmistake, you wouldn’t joke about it. Come on, let’s have tea. We’ve got\\nall sorts of secret stores in that cupboard. No, Lawrence—that’s the\\npoison cupboard. The big cupboard—that’s right.”\\n\\nWe had a very cheery tea, and assisted Cynthia to wash up afterwards.\\nWe had just put away the last tea-spoon when a knock came at the door.\\nThe countenances of Cynthia and Nibs were suddenly petrified into a\\nstern and forbidding expression.\\n\\n“Come in,” said Cynthia, in a sharp professional tone.\\n\\nA young and rather scared looking nurse appeared with a bottle which\\nshe proffered to Nibs, who waved her towards Cynthia with the somewhat\\nenigmatical remark:\\n\\n“_I_’m not really here to-day.”\\n\\nCynthia took the bottle and examined it with the severity of a judge.\\n\\n“This should have been sent up this morning.”\\n\\n“Sister is very sorry. She forgot.”\\n\\n“Sister should read the rules outside the door.”\\n\\nI gathered from the little nurse’s expression that there was not the\\nleast likelihood of her having the hardihood to retail this message to\\nthe dreaded “Sister”.\\n\\n“So now it can’t be done until to-morrow,” finished Cynthia.\\n\\n“Don’t you think you could possibly let us have it to-night?”\\n\\n“Well,” said Cynthia graciously, “we are very busy, but if we have time\\nit shall be done.”\\n\\nThe little nurse withdrew, and Cynthia promptly took a jar from the\\nshelf, refilled the bottle, and placed it on the table outside the\\ndoor.\\n\\nI laughed.\\n\\n“Discipline must be maintained?”\\n\\n“Exactly. Come out on our little balcony. You can see all the outside\\nwards there.”\\n\\nI followed Cynthia and her friend and they pointed out the different\\nwards to me. Lawrence remained behind, but after a few moments Cynthia\\ncalled to him over her shoulder to come and join us. Then she looked at\\nher watch.\\n\\n“Nothing more to do, Nibs?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“All right. Then we can lock up and go.”\\n\\nI had seen Lawrence in quite a different light that afternoon. Compared\\nto John, he was an astoundingly difficult person to get to know. He was\\nthe opposite of his brother in almost every respect, being unusually\\nshy and reserved. Yet he had a certain charm of manner, and I fancied\\nthat, if one really knew him well, one could have a deep affection for\\nhim. I had always fancied that his manner to Cynthia was rather\\nconstrained, and that she on her side was inclined to be shy of him.\\nBut they were both gay enough this afternoon, and chatted together like\\na couple of children.\\n\\nAs we drove through the village, I remembered that I wanted some\\nstamps, so accordingly we pulled up at the post office.\\n\\nAs I came out again, I cannoned into a little man who was just\\nentering. I drew aside and apologised, when suddenly, with a loud\\nexclamation, he clasped me in his arms and kissed me warmly.\\n\\n“_Mon ami_ Hastings!” he cried. “It is indeed _mon ami_ Hastings!”\\n\\n“Poirot!” I exclaimed.\\n\\nI turned to the pony-trap.\\n\\n“This is a very pleasant meeting for me, Miss Cynthia. This is my old\\nfriend, Monsieur Poirot, whom I have not seen for years.”\\n\\n“Oh, we know Monsieur Poirot,” said Cynthia gaily. “But I had no idea\\nhe was a friend of yours.”\\n\\n“Yes, indeed,” said Poirot seriously. “I know Mademoiselle Cynthia. It\\nis by the charity of that good Mrs. Inglethorp that I am here.” Then,\\nas I looked at him inquiringly: “Yes, my friend, she had kindly\\nextended hospitality to seven of my countrypeople who, alas, are\\nrefugees from their native land. We Belgians will always remember her\\nwith gratitude.”\\n\\nPoirot was an extraordinary looking little man. He was hardly more than\\nfive feet, four inches, but carried himself with great dignity. His\\nhead was exactly the shape of an egg, and he always perched it a little\\non one side. His moustache was very stiff and military. The neatness of\\nhis attire was almost incredible. I believe a speck of dust would have\\ncaused him more pain than a bullet wound. Yet this quaint dandified\\nlittle man who, I was sorry to see, now limped badly, had been in his\\ntime one of the most celebrated members of the Belgian police. As a\\ndetective, his _flair_ had been extraordinary, and he had achieved\\ntriumphs by unravelling some of the most baffling cases of the day.\\n\\nHe pointed out to me the little house inhabited by him and his fellow\\nBelgians, and I promised to go and see him at an early date. Then he\\nraised his hat with a flourish to Cynthia, and we drove away.\\n\\n“He’s a dear little man,” said Cynthia. “I’d no idea you knew him.”\\n\\n“You’ve been entertaining a celebrity unawares,” I replied.\\n\\nAnd, for the rest of the way home, I recited to them the various\\nexploits and triumphs of Hercule Poirot.\\n\\nWe arrived back in a very cheerful mood. As we entered the hall, Mrs.\\nInglethorp came out of her boudoir. She looked flushed and upset.\\n\\n“Oh, it’s you,” she said.\\n\\n“Is there anything the matter, Aunt Emily?” asked Cynthia.\\n\\n“Certainly not,” said Mrs. Inglethorp sharply. “What should there be?”\\nThen catching sight of Dorcas, the parlourmaid, going into the\\ndining-room, she called to her to bring some stamps into the boudoir.\\n\\n“Yes, m’m.” The old servant hesitated, then added diffidently: “Don’t\\nyou think, m’m, you’d better get to bed? You’re looking very tired.”\\n\\n“Perhaps you’re right, Dorcas—yes—no—not now. I’ve some letters I must\\nfinish by post-time. Have you lighted the fire in my room as I told\\nyou?”\\n\\n“Yes, m’m.”\\n\\n“Then I’ll go to bed directly after supper.”\\n\\nShe went into the boudoir again, and Cynthia stared after her.\\n\\n“Goodness gracious! I wonder what’s up?” she said to Lawrence.\\n\\nHe did not seem to have heard her, for without a word he turned on his\\nheel and went out of the house.\\n\\nI suggested a quick game of tennis before supper and, Cynthia agreeing,\\nI ran upstairs to fetch my racquet.\\n\\nMrs. Cavendish was coming down the stairs. It may have been my fancy,\\nbut she, too, was looking odd and disturbed.\\n\\n“Had a good walk with Dr. Bauerstein?” I asked, trying to appear as\\nindifferent as I could.\\n\\n“I didn’t go,” she replied abruptly. “Where is Mrs. Inglethorp?”\\n\\n“In the boudoir.”\\n\\nHer hand clenched itself on the banisters, then she seemed to nerve\\nherself for some encounter, and went rapidly past me down the stairs\\nacross the hall to the boudoir, the door of which she shut behind her.\\n\\nAs I ran out to the tennis court a few moments later, I had to pass the\\nopen boudoir window, and was unable to help overhearing the following\\nscrap of dialogue. Mary Cavendish was saying in the voice of a woman\\ndesperately controlling herself:\\n\\n“Then you won’t show it to me?”\\n\\nTo which Mrs. Inglethorp replied:\\n\\n“My dear Mary, it has nothing to do with that matter.”\\n\\n“Then show it to me.”\\n\\n“I tell you it is not what you imagine. It does not concern you in the\\nleast.”\\n\\nTo which Mary Cavendish replied, with a rising bitterness:\\n\\n“Of course, I might have known you would shield him.”\\n\\nCynthia was waiting for me, and greeted me eagerly with:\\n\\n“I say! There’s been the most awful row! I’ve got it all out of\\nDorcas.”\\n\\n“What kind of a row?”\\n\\n“Between Aunt Emily and _him_. I do hope she’s found him out at last!”\\n\\n“Was Dorcas there, then?”\\n\\n“Of course not. She ‘happened to be near the door’. It was a real old\\nbust-up. I do wish I knew what it was all about.”\\n\\nI thought of Mrs. Raikes’s gipsy face, and Evelyn Howard’s warnings,\\nbut wisely decided to hold my peace, whilst Cynthia exhausted every\\npossible hypothesis, and cheerfully hoped, “Aunt Emily will send him\\naway, and will never speak to him again.”\\n\\nI was anxious to get hold of John, but he was nowhere to be seen.\\nEvidently something very momentous had occurred that afternoon. I tried\\nto forget the few words I had overheard; but, do what I would, I could\\nnot dismiss them altogether from my mind. What was Mary Cavendish’s\\nconcern in the matter?\\n\\nMr. Inglethorp was in the drawing-room when I came down to supper. His\\nface was impassive as ever, and the strange unreality of the man struck\\nme afresh.\\n\\nMrs. Inglethorp came down last. She still looked agitated, and during\\nthe meal there was a somewhat constrained silence. Inglethorp was\\nunusually quiet. As a rule, he surrounded his wife with little\\nattentions, placing a cushion at her back, and altogether playing the\\npart of the devoted husband. Immediately after supper, Mrs. Inglethorp\\nretired to her boudoir again.\\n\\n“Send my coffee in here, Mary,” she called. “I’ve just five minutes to\\ncatch the post.”\\n\\nCynthia and I went and sat by the open window in the drawing-room. Mary\\nCavendish brought our coffee to us. She seemed excited.\\n\\n“Do you young people want lights, or do you enjoy the twilight?” she\\nasked. “Will you take Mrs. Inglethorp her coffee, Cynthia? I will pour\\nit out.”\\n\\n“Do not trouble, Mary,” said Inglethorp. “I will take it to Emily.” He\\npoured it out, and went out of the room carrying it carefully.\\n\\nLawrence followed him, and Mrs. Cavendish sat down by us.\\n\\nWe three sat for some time in silence. It was a glorious night, hot and\\nstill. Mrs. Cavendish fanned herself gently with a palm leaf.\\n\\n“It’s almost too hot,” she murmured. “We shall have a thunderstorm.”\\n\\nAlas, that these harmonious moments can never endure! My paradise was\\nrudely shattered by the sound of a well known, and heartily disliked,\\nvoice in the hall.\\n\\n“Dr. Bauerstein!” exclaimed Cynthia. “What a funny time to come.”\\n\\nI glanced jealously at Mary Cavendish, but she seemed quite\\nundisturbed, the delicate pallor of her cheeks did not vary.\\n\\nIn a few moments, Alfred Inglethorp had ushered the doctor in, the\\nlatter laughing, and protesting that he was in no fit state for a\\ndrawing-room. In truth, he presented a sorry spectacle, being literally\\nplastered with mud.\\n\\n“What have you been doing, doctor?” cried Mrs. Cavendish.\\n\\n“I must make my apologies,” said the doctor. “I did not really mean to\\ncome in, but Mr. Inglethorp insisted.”\\n\\n“Well, Bauerstein, you are in a plight,” said John, strolling in from\\nthe hall. “Have some coffee, and tell us what you have been up to.”\\n\\n“Thank you, I will.” He laughed rather ruefully, as he described how he\\nhad discovered a very rare species of fern in an inaccessible place,\\nand in his efforts to obtain it had lost his footing, and slipped\\nignominiously into a neighbouring pond.\\n\\n“The sun soon dried me off,” he added, “but I’m afraid my appearance is\\nvery disreputable.”\\n\\nAt this juncture, Mrs. Inglethorp called to Cynthia from the hall, and\\nthe girl ran out.\\n\\n“Just carry up my despatch-case, will you, dear? I’m going to bed.”\\n\\nThe door into the hall was a wide one. I had risen when Cynthia did,\\nJohn was close by me. There were therefore three witnesses who could\\nswear that Mrs. Inglethorp was carrying her coffee, as yet untasted, in\\nher hand.\\n\\nMy evening was utterly and entirely spoilt by the presence of Dr.\\nBauerstein. It seemed to me the man would never go. He rose at last,\\nhowever, and I breathed a sigh of relief.\\n\\n“I’ll walk down to the village with you,” said Mr. Inglethorp. “I must\\nsee our agent over those estate accounts.” He turned to John. “No one\\nneed sit up. I will take the latch-key.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III.\\nTHE NIGHT OF THE TRAGEDY\\n\\n\\nTo make this part of my story clear, I append the following plan of the\\nfirst floor of Styles. The servants’ rooms are reached through the door\\nB. They have no communication with the right wing, where the\\nInglethorps’ rooms were situated.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nIt seemed to be the middle of the night when I was awakened by Lawrence\\nCavendish. He had a candle in his hand, and the agitation of his face\\ntold me at once that something was seriously wrong.\\n\\n“What’s the matter?” I asked, sitting up in bed, and trying to collect\\nmy scattered thoughts.\\n\\n“We are afraid my mother is very ill. She seems to be having some kind\\nof fit. Unfortunately she has locked herself in.”\\n\\n“I’ll come at once.”\\n\\nI sprang out of bed; and, pulling on a dressing-gown, followed Lawrence\\nalong the passage and the gallery to the right wing of the house.\\n\\nJohn Cavendish joined us, and one or two of the servants were standing\\nround in a state of awe-stricken excitement. Lawrence turned to his\\nbrother.\\n\\n“What do you think we had better do?”\\n\\nNever, I thought, had his indecision of character been more apparent.\\n\\nJohn rattled the handle of Mrs. Inglethorp’s door violently, but with\\nno effect. It was obviously locked or bolted on the inside. The whole\\nhousehold was aroused by now. The most alarming sounds were audible\\nfrom the interior of the room. Clearly something must be done.\\n\\n“Try going through Mr. Inglethorp’s room, sir,” cried Dorcas. “Oh, the\\npoor mistress!”\\n\\nSuddenly I realized that Alfred Inglethorp was not with us—that he\\nalone had given no sign of his presence. John opened the door of his\\nroom. It was pitch dark, but Lawrence was following with the candle,\\nand by its feeble light we saw that the bed had not been slept in, and\\nthat there was no sign of the room having been occupied.\\n\\nWe went straight to the connecting door. That, too, was locked or\\nbolted on the inside. What was to be done?\\n\\n“Oh, dear, sir,” cried Dorcas, wringing her hands, “what ever shall we\\ndo?”\\n\\n“We must try and break the door in, I suppose. It’ll be a tough job,\\nthough. Here, let one of the maids go down and wake Baily and tell him\\nto go for Dr. Wilkins at once. Now then, we’ll have a try at the door.\\nHalf a moment, though, isn’t there a door into Miss Cynthia’s rooms?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir, but that’s always bolted. It’s never been undone.”\\n\\n“Well, we might just see.”\\n\\nHe ran rapidly down the corridor to Cynthia’s room. Mary Cavendish was\\nthere, shaking the girl—who must have been an unusually sound\\nsleeper—and trying to wake her.\\n\\nIn a moment or two he was back.\\n\\n“No good. That’s bolted too. We must break in the door. I think this\\none is a shade less solid than the one in the passage.”\\n\\nWe strained and heaved together. The framework of the door was solid,\\nand for a long time it resisted our efforts, but at last we felt it\\ngive beneath our weight, and finally, with a resounding crash, it was\\nburst open.\\n\\nWe stumbled in together, Lawrence still holding his candle. Mrs.\\nInglethorp was lying on the bed, her whole form agitated by violent\\nconvulsions, in one of which she must have overturned the table beside\\nher. As we entered, however, her limbs relaxed, and she fell back upon\\nthe pillows.\\n\\nJohn strode across the room, and lit the gas. Turning to Annie, one of\\nthe housemaids, he sent her downstairs to the dining-room for brandy.\\nThen he went across to his mother whilst I unbolted the door that gave\\non the corridor.\\n\\nI turned to Lawrence, to suggest that I had better leave them now that\\nthere was no further need of my services, but the words were frozen on\\nmy lips. Never have I seen such a ghastly look on any man’s face. He\\nwas white as chalk, the candle he held in his shaking hand was\\nsputtering onto the carpet, and his eyes, petrified with terror, or\\nsome such kindred emotion, stared fixedly over my head at a point on\\nthe further wall. It was as though he had seen something that turned\\nhim to stone. I instinctively followed the direction of his eyes, but I\\ncould see nothing unusual. The still feebly flickering ashes in the\\ngrate, and the row of prim ornaments on the mantelpiece, were surely\\nharmless enough.\\n\\nThe violence of Mrs. Inglethorp’s attack seemed to be passing. She was\\nable to speak in short gasps.\\n\\n“Better now—very sudden—stupid of me—to lock myself in.”\\n\\nA shadow fell on the bed and, looking up, I saw Mary Cavendish standing\\nnear the door with her arm around Cynthia. She seemed to be supporting\\nthe girl, who looked utterly dazed and unlike herself. Her face was\\nheavily flushed, and she yawned repeatedly.\\n\\n“Poor Cynthia is quite frightened,” said Mrs. Cavendish in a low clear\\nvoice. She herself, I noticed, was dressed in her white land smock.\\nThen it must be later than I thought. I saw that a faint streak of\\ndaylight was showing through the curtains of the windows, and that the\\nclock on the mantelpiece pointed to close upon five o’clock.\\n\\nA strangled cry from the bed startled me. A fresh access of pain seized\\nthe unfortunate old lady. The convulsions were of a violence terrible\\nto behold. Everything was confusion. We thronged round her, powerless\\nto help or alleviate. A final convulsion lifted her from the bed, until\\nshe appeared to rest upon her head and her heels, with her body arched\\nin an extraordinary manner. In vain Mary and John tried to administer\\nmore brandy. The moments flew. Again the body arched itself in that\\npeculiar fashion.\\n\\nAt that moment, Dr. Bauerstein pushed his way authoritatively into the\\nroom. For one instant he stopped dead, staring at the figure on the\\nbed, and, at the same instant, Mrs. Inglethorp cried out in a strangled\\nvoice, her eyes fixed on the doctor:\\n\\n“Alfred—Alfred——” Then she fell back motionless on the pillows.\\n\\nWith a stride, the doctor reached the bed, and seizing her arms worked\\nthem energetically, applying what I knew to be artificial respiration.\\nHe issued a few short sharp orders to the servants. An imperious wave\\nof his hand drove us all to the door. We watched him, fascinated,\\nthough I think we all knew in our hearts that it was too late, and that\\nnothing could be done now. I could see by the expression on his face\\nthat he himself had little hope.\\n\\nFinally he abandoned his task, shaking his head gravely. At that\\nmoment, we heard footsteps outside, and Dr. Wilkins, Mrs. Inglethorp’s\\nown doctor, a portly, fussy little man, came bustling in.\\n\\nIn a few words Dr. Bauerstein explained how he had happened to be\\npassing the lodge gates as the car came out, and had run up to the\\nhouse as fast as he could, whilst the car went on to fetch Dr. Wilkins.\\nWith a faint gesture of the hand, he indicated the figure on the bed.\\n\\n“Ve—ry sad. Ve—ry sad,” murmured Dr. Wilkins. “Poor dear lady. Always\\ndid far too much—far too much—against my advice. I warned her. Her\\nheart was far from strong. ‘Take it easy,’ I said to her,\\n‘Take—it—easy’. But no—her zeal for good works was too great. Nature\\nrebelled. Na—ture—re—belled.”\\n\\nDr. Bauerstein, I noticed, was watching the local doctor narrowly. He\\nstill kept his eyes fixed on him as he spoke.\\n\\n“The convulsions were of a peculiar violence, Dr. Wilkins. I am sorry\\nyou were not here in time to witness them. They were quite—tetanic in\\ncharacter.”\\n\\n“Ah!” said Dr. Wilkins wisely.\\n\\n“I should like to speak to you in private,” said Dr. Bauerstein. He\\nturned to John. “You do not object?”\\n\\n“Certainly not.”\\n\\nWe all trooped out into the corridor, leaving the two doctors alone,\\nand I heard the key turned in the lock behind us.\\n\\nWe went slowly down the stairs. I was violently excited. I have a\\ncertain talent for deduction, and Dr. Bauerstein’s manner had started a\\nflock of wild surmises in my mind. Mary Cavendish laid her hand upon my\\narm.\\n\\n“What is it? Why did Dr. Bauerstein seem so—peculiar?”\\n\\nI looked at her.\\n\\n“Do you know what I think?”\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“Listen!” I looked round, the others were out of earshot. I lowered my\\nvoice to a whisper. “I believe she has been poisoned! I’m certain Dr.\\nBauerstein suspects it.”\\n\\n“_What?_” She shrank against the wall, the pupils of her eyes dilating\\nwildly. Then, with a sudden cry that startled me, she cried out: “No,\\nno—not that—not that!” And breaking from me, fled up the stairs. I\\nfollowed her, afraid that she was going to faint. I found her leaning\\nagainst the bannisters, deadly pale. She waved me away impatiently.\\n\\n“No, no—leave me. I’d rather be alone. Let me just be quiet for a\\nminute or two. Go down to the others.”\\n\\nI obeyed her reluctantly. John and Lawrence were in the dining-room. I\\njoined them. We were all silent, but I suppose I voiced the thoughts of\\nus all when I at last broke it by saying:\\n\\n“Where is Mr. Inglethorp?”\\n\\nJohn shook his head.\\n\\n“He’s not in the house.”\\n\\nOur eyes met. Where _was_ Alfred Inglethorp? His absence was strange\\nand inexplicable. I remembered Mrs. Inglethorp’s dying words. What lay\\nbeneath them? What more could she have told us, if she had had time?\\n\\nAt last we heard the doctors descending the stairs. Dr. Wilkins was\\nlooking important and excited, and trying to conceal an inward\\nexultation under a manner of decorous calm. Dr. Bauerstein remained in\\nthe background, his grave bearded face unchanged. Dr. Wilkins was the\\nspokesman for the two. He addressed himself to John:\\n\\n“Mr. Cavendish, I should like your consent to a post-mortem.”\\n\\n“Is that necessary?” asked John gravely. A spasm of pain crossed his\\nface.\\n\\n“Absolutely,” said Dr. Bauerstein.\\n\\n“You mean by that——?”\\n\\n“That neither Dr. Wilkins nor myself could give a death certificate\\nunder the circumstances.”\\n\\nJohn bent his head.\\n\\n“In that case, I have no alternative but to agree.”\\n\\n“Thank you,” said Dr. Wilkins briskly. “We propose that it should take\\nplace to-morrow night—or rather to-night.” And he glanced at the\\ndaylight. “Under the circumstances, I am afraid an inquest can hardly\\nbe avoided—these formalities are necessary, but I beg that you won’t\\ndistress yourselves.”\\n\\nThere was a pause, and then Dr. Bauerstein drew two keys from his\\npocket, and handed them to John.\\n\\n“These are the keys of the two rooms. I have locked them and, in my\\nopinion, they would be better kept locked for the present.”\\n\\nThe doctors then departed.\\n\\nI had been turning over an idea in my head, and I felt that the moment\\nhad now come to broach it. Yet I was a little chary of doing so. John,\\nI knew, had a horror of any kind of publicity, and was an easygoing\\noptimist, who preferred never to meet trouble half-way. It might be\\ndifficult to convince him of the soundness of my plan. Lawrence, on the\\nother hand, being less conventional, and having more imagination, I\\nfelt I might count upon as an ally. There was no doubt that the moment\\nhad come for me to take the lead.\\n\\n“John,” I said, “I am going to ask you something.”\\n\\n“Well?”\\n\\n“You remember my speaking of my friend Poirot? The Belgian who is here?\\nHe has been a most famous detective.”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“I want you to let me call him in—to investigate this matter.”\\n\\n“What—now? Before the post-mortem?”\\n\\n“Yes, time is an advantage if—if—there has been foul play.”\\n\\n“Rubbish!” cried Lawrence angrily. “In my opinion the whole thing is a\\nmare’s nest of Bauerstein’s! Wilkins hadn’t an idea of such a thing,\\nuntil Bauerstein put it into his head. But, like all specialists,\\nBauerstein’s got a bee in his bonnet. Poisons are his hobby, so of\\ncourse he sees them everywhere.”\\n\\nI confess that I was surprised by Lawrence’s attitude. He was so seldom\\nvehement about anything.\\n\\nJohn hesitated.\\n\\n“I can’t feel as you do, Lawrence,” he said at last. “I’m inclined to\\ngive Hastings a free hand, though I should prefer to wait a bit. We\\ndon’t want any unnecessary scandal.”\\n\\n“No, no,” I cried eagerly, “you need have no fear of that. Poirot is\\ndiscretion itself.”\\n\\n“Very well, then, have it your own way. I leave it in your hands.\\nThough, if it is as we suspect, it seems a clear enough case. God\\nforgive me if I am wronging him!”\\n\\nI looked at my watch. It was six o’clock. I determined to lose no time.\\n\\nFive minutes’ delay, however, I allowed myself. I spent it in\\nransacking the library until I discovered a medical book which gave a\\ndescription of strychnine poisoning.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV.\\nPOIROT INVESTIGATES\\n\\n\\nThe house which the Belgians occupied in the village was quite close to\\nthe park gates. One could save time by taking a narrow path through the\\nlong grass, which cut off the detours of the winding drive. So I,\\naccordingly, went that way. I had nearly reached the lodge, when my\\nattention was arrested by the running figure of a man approaching me.\\nIt was Mr. Inglethorp. Where had he been? How did he intend to explain\\nhis absence?\\n\\nHe accosted me eagerly.\\n\\n“My God! This is terrible! My poor wife! I have only just heard.”\\n\\n“Where have you been?” I asked.\\n\\n“Denby kept me late last night. It was one o’clock before we’d\\nfinished. Then I found that I’d forgotten the latch-key after all. I\\ndidn’t want to arouse the household, so Denby gave me a bed.”\\n\\n“How did you hear the news?” I asked.\\n\\n“Wilkins knocked Denby up to tell him. My poor Emily! She was so\\nself-sacrificing—such a noble character. She over-taxed her strength.”\\n\\nA wave of revulsion swept over me. What a consummate hypocrite the man\\nwas!\\n\\n“I must hurry on,” I said, thankful that he did not ask me whither I\\nwas bound.\\n\\nIn a few minutes I was knocking at the door of Leastways Cottage.\\n\\nGetting no answer, I repeated my summons impatiently. A window above me\\nwas cautiously opened, and Poirot himself looked out.\\n\\nHe gave an exclamation of surprise at seeing me. In a few brief words,\\nI explained the tragedy that had occurred, and that I wanted his help.\\n\\n“Wait, my friend, I will let you in, and you shall recount to me the\\naffair whilst I dress.”\\n\\nIn a few moments he had unbarred the door, and I followed him up to his\\nroom. There he installed me in a chair, and I related the whole story,\\nkeeping back nothing, and omitting no circumstance, however\\ninsignificant, whilst he himself made a careful and deliberate toilet.\\n\\nI told him of my awakening, of Mrs. Inglethorp’s dying words, of her\\nhusband’s absence, of the quarrel the day before, of the scrap of\\nconversation between Mary and her mother-in-law that I had overheard,\\nof the former quarrel between Mrs. Inglethorp and Evelyn Howard, and of\\nthe latter’s innuendoes.\\n\\nI was hardly as clear as I could wish. I repeated myself several times,\\nand occasionally had to go back to some detail that I had forgotten.\\nPoirot smiled kindly on me.\\n\\n“The mind is confused? Is it not so? Take time, _mon ami_. You are\\nagitated; you are excited—it is but natural. Presently, when we are\\ncalmer, we will arrange the facts, neatly, each in his proper place. We\\nwill examine—and reject. Those of importance we will put on one side;\\nthose of no importance, pouf!”—he screwed up his cherub-like face, and\\npuffed comically enough—“blow them away!”\\n\\n“That’s all very well,” I objected, “but how are you going to decide\\nwhat is important, and what isn’t? That always seems the difficulty to\\nme.”\\n\\nPoirot shook his head energetically. He was now arranging his moustache\\nwith exquisite care.\\n\\n“Not so. _Voyons!_ One fact leads to another—so we continue. Does the\\nnext fit in with that? _A merveille!_ Good! We can proceed. This next\\nlittle fact—no! Ah, that is curious! There is something missing—a link\\nin the chain that is not there. We examine. We search. And that little\\ncurious fact, that possibly paltry little detail that will not tally,\\nwe put it here!” He made an extravagant gesture with his hand. “It is\\nsignificant! It is tremendous!”\\n\\n“Y—es——”\\n\\n“Ah!” Poirot shook his forefinger so fiercely at me that I quailed\\nbefore it. “Beware! Peril to the detective who says: ‘It is so small—it\\ndoes not matter. It will not agree. I will forget it.’ That way lies\\nconfusion! Everything matters.”\\n\\n“I know. You always told me that. That’s why I have gone into all the\\ndetails of this thing whether they seemed to me relevant or not.”\\n\\n“And I am pleased with you. You have a good memory, and you have given\\nme the facts faithfully. Of the order in which you present them, I say\\nnothing—truly, it is deplorable! But I make allowances—you are upset.\\nTo that I attribute the circumstance that you have omitted one fact of\\nparamount importance.”\\n\\n“What is that?” I asked.\\n\\n“You have not told me if Mrs. Inglethorp ate well last night.”\\n\\nI stared at him. Surely the war had affected the little man’s brain. He\\nwas carefully engaged in brushing his coat before putting it on, and\\nseemed wholly engrossed in the task.\\n\\n“I don’t remember,” I said. “And, anyway, I don’t see——”\\n\\n“You do not see? But it is of the first importance.”\\n\\n“I can’t see why,” I said, rather nettled. “As far as I can remember,\\nshe didn’t eat much. She was obviously upset, and it had taken her\\nappetite away. That was only natural.”\\n\\n“Yes,” said Poirot thoughtfully, “it was only natural.”\\n\\nHe opened a drawer, and took out a small despatch-case, then turned to\\nme.\\n\\n“Now I am ready. We will proceed to the château, and study matters on\\nthe spot. Excuse me, _mon ami_, you dressed in haste, and your tie is\\non one side. Permit me.” With a deft gesture, he rearranged it.\\n\\n“_Ça y est!_ Now, shall we start?”\\n\\nWe hurried up the village, and turned in at the lodge gates. Poirot\\nstopped for a moment, and gazed sorrowfully over the beautiful expanse\\nof park, still glittering with morning dew.\\n\\n“So beautiful, so beautiful, and yet, the poor family, plunged in\\nsorrow, prostrated with grief.”\\n\\nHe looked at me keenly as he spoke, and I was aware that I reddened\\nunder his prolonged gaze.\\n\\nWas the family prostrated by grief? Was the sorrow at Mrs. Inglethorp’s\\ndeath so great? I realized that there was an emotional lack in the\\natmosphere. The dead woman had not the gift of commanding love. Her\\ndeath was a shock and a distress, but she would not be passionately\\nregretted.\\n\\nPoirot seemed to follow my thoughts. He nodded his head gravely.\\n\\n“No, you are right,” he said, “it is not as though there was a blood\\ntie. She has been kind and generous to these Cavendishes, but she was\\nnot their own mother. Blood tells—always remember that—blood tells.”\\n\\n“Poirot,” I said, “I wish you would tell me why you wanted to know if\\nMrs. Inglethorp ate well last night? I have been turning it over in my\\nmind, but I can’t see how it has anything to do with the matter?”\\n\\nHe was silent for a minute or two as we walked along, but finally he\\nsaid:\\n\\n“I do not mind telling you—though, as you know, it is not my habit to\\nexplain until the end is reached. The present contention is that Mrs.\\nInglethorp died of strychnine poisoning, presumably administered in her\\ncoffee.”\\n\\n“Yes?”\\n\\n“Well, what time was the coffee served?”\\n\\n“About eight o’clock.”\\n\\n“Therefore she drank it between then and half-past eight—certainly not\\nmuch later. Well, strychnine is a fairly rapid poison. Its effects\\nwould be felt very soon, probably in about an hour. Yet, in Mrs.\\nInglethorp’s case, the symptoms do not manifest themselves until five\\no’clock the next morning: nine hours! But a heavy meal, taken at about\\nthe same time as the poison, might retard its effects, though hardly to\\nthat extent. Still, it is a possibility to be taken into account. But,\\naccording to you, she ate very little for supper, and yet the symptoms\\ndo not develop until early the next morning! Now that is a curious\\ncircumstance, my friend. Something may arise at the autopsy to explain\\nit. In the meantime, remember it.”\\n\\nAs we neared the house, John came out and met us. His face looked weary\\nand haggard.\\n\\n“This is a very dreadful business, Monsieur Poirot,” he said. “Hastings\\nhas explained to you that we are anxious for no publicity?”\\n\\n“I comprehend perfectly.”\\n\\n“You see, it is only suspicion so far. We have nothing to go upon.”\\n\\n“Precisely. It is a matter of precaution only.”\\n\\nJohn turned to me, taking out his cigarette-case, and lighting a\\ncigarette as he did so.\\n\\n“You know that fellow Inglethorp is back?”\\n\\n“Yes. I met him.”\\n\\nJohn flung the match into an adjacent flower bed, a proceeding which\\nwas too much for Poirot’s feelings. He retrieved it, and buried it\\nneatly.\\n\\n“It’s jolly difficult to know how to treat him.”\\n\\n“That difficulty will not exist long,” pronounced Poirot quietly.\\n\\nJohn looked puzzled, not quite understanding the portent of this\\ncryptic saying. He handed the two keys which Dr. Bauerstein had given\\nhim to me.\\n\\n“Show Monsieur Poirot everything he wants to see.”\\n\\n“The rooms are locked?” asked Poirot.\\n\\n“Dr. Bauerstein considered it advisable.”\\n\\nPoirot nodded thoughtfully.\\n\\n“Then he is very sure. Well, that simplifies matters for us.”\\n\\nWe went up together to the room of the tragedy. For convenience I\\nappend a plan of the room and the principal articles of furniture in\\nit.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nPoirot locked the door on the inside, and proceeded to a minute\\ninspection of the room. He darted from one object to the other with the\\nagility of a grasshopper. I remained by the door, fearing to obliterate\\nany clues. Poirot, however, did not seem grateful to me for my\\nforbearance.\\n\\n“What have you, my friend,” he cried, “that you remain there like—how\\ndo you say it?—ah, yes, the stuck pig?”\\n\\nI explained that I was afraid of obliterating any foot-marks.\\n\\n“Foot-marks? But what an idea! There has already been practically an\\narmy in the room! What foot-marks are we likely to find? No, come here\\nand aid me in my search. I will put down my little case until I need\\nit.”\\n\\nHe did so, on the round table by the window, but it was an ill-advised\\nproceeding; for, the top of it being loose, it tilted up, and\\nprecipitated the despatch-case on the floor.\\n\\n“_Eh voilà une table!_” cried Poirot. “Ah, my friend, one may live in a\\nbig house and yet have no comfort.”\\n\\nAfter which piece of moralizing, he resumed his search.\\n\\nA small purple despatch-case, with a key in the lock, on the\\nwriting-table, engaged his attention for some time. He took out the key\\nfrom the lock, and passed it to me to inspect. I saw nothing peculiar,\\nhowever. It was an ordinary key of the Yale type, with a bit of twisted\\nwire through the handle.\\n\\nNext, he examined the framework of the door we had broken in, assuring\\nhimself that the bolt had really been shot. Then he went to the door\\nopposite leading into Cynthia’s room. That door was also bolted, as I\\nhad stated. However, he went to the length of unbolting it, and opening\\nand shutting it several times; this he did with the utmost precaution\\nagainst making any noise. Suddenly something in the bolt itself seemed\\nto rivet his attention. He examined it carefully, and then, nimbly\\nwhipping out a pair of small forceps from his case, he drew out some\\nminute particle which he carefully sealed up in a tiny envelope.\\n\\nOn the chest of drawers there was a tray with a spirit lamp and a small\\nsaucepan on it. A small quantity of a dark fluid remained in the\\nsaucepan, and an empty cup and saucer that had been drunk out of stood\\nnear it.\\n\\nI wondered how I could have been so unobservant as to overlook this.\\nHere was a clue worth having. Poirot delicately dipped his finger into\\nliquid, and tasted it gingerly. He made a grimace.\\n\\n“Cocoa—with—I think—rum in it.”\\n\\nHe passed on to the debris on the floor, where the table by the bed had\\nbeen overturned. A reading-lamp, some books, matches, a bunch of keys,\\nand the crushed fragments of a coffee-cup lay scattered about.\\n\\n“Ah, this is curious,” said Poirot.\\n\\n“I must confess that I see nothing particularly curious about it.”\\n\\n“You do not? Observe the lamp—the chimney is broken in two places; they\\nlie there as they fell. But see, the coffee-cup is absolutely smashed\\nto powder.”\\n\\n“Well,” I said wearily, “I suppose someone must have stepped on it.”\\n\\n“Exactly,” said Poirot, in an odd voice. “Someone stepped on it.”\\n\\nHe rose from his knees, and walked slowly across to the mantelpiece,\\nwhere he stood abstractedly fingering the ornaments, and straightening\\nthem—a trick of his when he was agitated.\\n\\n“_Mon ami_,” he said, turning to me, “somebody stepped on that cup,\\ngrinding it to powder, and the reason they did so was either because it\\ncontained strychnine or—which is far more serious—because it did not\\ncontain strychnine!”\\n\\nI made no reply. I was bewildered, but I knew that it was no good\\nasking him to explain. In a moment or two he roused himself, and went\\non with his investigations. He picked up the bunch of keys from the\\nfloor, and twirling them round in his fingers finally selected one,\\nvery bright and shining, which he tried in the lock of the purple\\ndespatch-case. It fitted, and he opened the box, but after a moment’s\\nhesitation, closed and relocked it, and slipped the bunch of keys, as\\nwell as the key that had originally stood in the lock, into his own\\npocket.\\n\\n“I have no authority to go through these papers. But it should be\\ndone—at once!”\\n\\nHe then made a very careful examination of the drawers of the\\nwash-stand. Crossing the room to the left-hand window, a round stain,\\nhardly visible on the dark brown carpet, seemed to interest him\\nparticularly. He went down on his knees, examining it minutely—even\\ngoing so far as to smell it.\\n\\nFinally, he poured a few drops of the cocoa into a test tube, sealing\\nit up carefully. His next proceeding was to take out a little notebook.\\n\\n“We have found in this room,” he said, writing busily, “six points of\\ninterest. Shall I enumerate them, or will you?”\\n\\n“Oh, you,” I replied hastily.\\n\\n“Very well, then. One, a coffee-cup that has been ground into powder;\\ntwo, a despatch-case with a key in the lock; three, a stain on the\\nfloor.”\\n\\n“That may have been done some time ago,” I interrupted.\\n\\n“No, for it is still perceptibly damp and smells of coffee. Four, a\\nfragment of some dark green fabric—only a thread or two, but\\nrecognizable.”\\n\\n“Ah!” I cried. “That was what you sealed up in the envelope.”\\n\\n“Yes. It may turn out to be a piece of one of Mrs. Inglethorp’s own\\ndresses, and quite unimportant. We shall see. Five, _this_!” With a\\ndramatic gesture, he pointed to a large splash of candle grease on the\\nfloor by the writing-table. “It must have been done since yesterday,\\notherwise a good housemaid would have at once removed it with\\nblotting-paper and a hot iron. One of my best hats once—but that is not\\nto the point.”\\n\\n“It was very likely done last night. We were very agitated. Or perhaps\\nMrs. Inglethorp herself dropped her candle.”\\n\\n“You brought only one candle into the room?”\\n\\n“Yes. Lawrence Cavendish was carrying it. But he was very upset. He\\nseemed to see something over here”—I indicated the mantelpiece—“that\\nabsolutely paralysed him.”\\n\\n“That is interesting,” said Poirot quickly. “Yes, it is suggestive”—his\\neye sweeping the whole length of the wall—“but it was not his candle\\nthat made this great patch, for you perceive that this is white grease;\\nwhereas Monsieur Lawrence’s candle, which is still on the\\ndressing-table, is pink. On the other hand, Mrs. Inglethorp had no\\ncandlestick in the room, only a reading-lamp.”\\n\\n“Then,” I said, “what do you deduce?”\\n\\nTo which my friend only made a rather irritating reply, urging me to\\nuse my own natural faculties.\\n\\n“And the sixth point?” I asked. “I suppose it is the sample of cocoa.”\\n\\n“No,” said Poirot thoughtfully. “I might have included that in the six,\\nbut I did not. No, the sixth point I will keep to myself for the\\npresent.”\\n\\nHe looked quickly round the room. “There is nothing more to be done\\nhere, I think, unless”—he stared earnestly and long at the dead ashes\\nin the grate. “The fire burns—and it destroys. But by chance—there\\nmight be—let us see!”\\n\\nDeftly, on hands and knees, he began to sort the ashes from the grate\\ninto the fender, handling them with the greatest caution. Suddenly, he\\ngave a faint exclamation.\\n\\n“The forceps, Hastings!”\\n\\nI quickly handed them to him, and with skill he extracted a small piece\\nof half charred paper.\\n\\n“There, _mon ami!_” he cried. “What do you think of that?”\\n\\nI scrutinized the fragment. This is an exact reproduction of it:—\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nI was puzzled. It was unusually thick, quite unlike ordinary notepaper.\\nSuddenly an idea struck me.\\n\\n“Poirot!” I cried. “This is a fragment of a will!”\\n\\n“Exactly.”\\n\\nI looked up at him sharply.\\n\\n“You are not surprised?”\\n\\n“No,” he said gravely, “I expected it.”\\n\\nI relinquished the piece of paper, and watched him put it away in his\\ncase, with the same methodical care that he bestowed on everything. My\\nbrain was in a whirl. What was this complication of a will? Who had\\ndestroyed it? The person who had left the candle grease on the floor?\\nObviously. But how had anyone gained admission? All the doors had been\\nbolted on the inside.\\n\\n“Now, my friend,” said Poirot briskly, “we will go. I should like to\\nask a few questions of the parlourmaid—Dorcas, her name is, is it not?”\\n\\nWe passed through Alfred Inglethorp’s room, and Poirot delayed long\\nenough to make a brief but fairly comprehensive examination of it. We\\nwent out through that door, locking both it and that of Mrs.\\nInglethorp’s room as before.\\n\\nI took him down to the boudoir which he had expressed a wish to see,\\nand went myself in search of Dorcas.\\n\\nWhen I returned with her, however, the boudoir was empty.\\n\\n“Poirot,” I cried, “where are you?”\\n\\n“I am here, my friend.”\\n\\nHe had stepped outside the French window, and was standing, apparently\\nlost in admiration, before the various shaped flower beds.\\n\\n“Admirable!” he murmured. “Admirable! What symmetry! Observe that\\ncrescent; and those diamonds—their neatness rejoices the eye. The\\nspacing of the plants, also, is perfect. It has been recently done; is\\nit not so?”\\n\\n“Yes, I believe they were at it yesterday afternoon. But come in—Dorcas\\nis here.”\\n\\n“_Eh bien, eh bien!_ Do not grudge me a moment’s satisfaction of the\\neye.”\\n\\n“Yes, but this affair is more important.”\\n\\n“And how do you know that these fine begonias are not of equal\\nimportance?”\\n\\nI shrugged my shoulders. There was really no arguing with him if he\\nchose to take that line.\\n\\n“You do not agree? But such things have been. Well, we will come in and\\ninterview the brave Dorcas.”\\n\\nDorcas was standing in the boudoir, her hands folded in front of her,\\nand her grey hair rose in stiff waves under her white cap. She was the\\nvery model and picture of a good old-fashioned servant.\\n\\nIn her attitude towards Poirot, she was inclined to be suspicious, but\\nhe soon broke down her defences. He drew forward a chair.\\n\\n“Pray be seated, mademoiselle.”\\n\\n“Thank you, sir.”\\n\\n“You have been with your mistress many years, is it not so?”\\n\\n“Ten years, sir.”\\n\\n“That is a long time, and very faithful service. You were much attached\\nto her, were you not?”\\n\\n“She was a very good mistress to me, sir.”\\n\\n“Then you will not object to answering a few questions. I put them to\\nyou with Mr. Cavendish’s full approval.”\\n\\n“Oh, certainly, sir.”\\n\\n“Then I will begin by asking you about the events of yesterday\\nafternoon. Your mistress had a quarrel?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir. But I don’t know that I ought——” Dorcas hesitated.\\n\\nPoirot looked at her keenly.\\n\\n“My good Dorcas, it is necessary that I should know every detail of\\nthat quarrel as fully as possible. Do not think that you are betraying\\nyour mistress’s secrets. Your mistress lies dead, and it is necessary\\nthat we should know all—if we are to avenge her. Nothing can bring her\\nback to life, but we do hope, if there has been foul play, to bring the\\nmurderer to justice.”\\n\\n“Amen to that,” said Dorcas fiercely. “And, naming no names, there’s\\n_one_ in this house that none of us could ever abide! And an ill day it\\nwas when first _he_ darkened the threshold.”\\n\\nPoirot waited for her indignation to subside, and then, resuming his\\nbusiness-like tone, he asked:\\n\\n“Now, as to this quarrel? What is the first you heard of it?”\\n\\n“Well, sir, I happened to be going along the hall outside yesterday——”\\n\\n“What time was that?”\\n\\n“I couldn’t say exactly, sir, but it wasn’t tea-time by a long way.\\nPerhaps four o’clock—or it may have been a bit later. Well, sir, as I\\nsaid, I happened to be passing along, when I heard voices very loud and\\nangry in here. I didn’t exactly mean to listen, but—well, there it is.\\nI stopped. The door was shut, but the mistress was speaking very sharp\\nand clear, and I heard what she said quite plainly. ‘You have lied to\\nme, and deceived me,’ she said. I didn’t hear what Mr. Inglethorp\\nreplied. He spoke a good bit lower than she did—but she answered: ‘How\\ndare you? I have kept you and clothed you and fed you! You owe\\neverything to me! And this is how you repay me! By bringing disgrace\\nupon our name!’ Again I didn’t hear what he said, but she went on:\\n‘Nothing that you can say will make any difference. I see my duty\\nclearly. My mind is made up. You need not think that any fear of\\npublicity, or scandal between husband and wife will deter me.’ Then I\\nthought I heard them coming out, so I went off quickly.”\\n\\n“You are sure it was Mr. Inglethorp’s voice you heard?”\\n\\n“Oh, yes, sir, whose else’s could it be?”\\n\\n“Well, what happened next?”\\n\\n“Later, I came back to the hall; but it was all quiet. At five o’clock,\\nMrs. Inglethorp rang the bell and told me to bring her a cup of\\ntea—nothing to eat—to the boudoir. She was looking dreadful—so white\\nand upset. ‘Dorcas,’ she says, ‘I’ve had a great shock.’ ‘I’m sorry for\\nthat, m’m,’ I says. ‘You’ll feel better after a nice hot cup of tea,\\nm’m.’ She had something in her hand. I don’t know if it was a letter,\\nor just a piece of paper, but it had writing on it, and she kept\\nstaring at it, almost as if she couldn’t believe what was written\\nthere. She whispered to herself, as though she had forgotten I was\\nthere: ‘These few words—and everything’s changed.’ And then she says to\\nme: ‘Never trust a man, Dorcas, they’re not worth it!’ I hurried off,\\nand got her a good strong cup of tea, and she thanked me, and said\\nshe’d feel better when she’d drunk it. ‘I don’t know what to do,’ she\\nsays. ‘Scandal between husband and wife is a dreadful thing, Dorcas.\\nI’d rather hush it up if I could.’ Mrs. Cavendish came in just then, so\\nshe didn’t say any more.”\\n\\n“She still had the letter, or whatever it was, in her hand?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes, sir.”\\n\\n“What would she be likely to do with it afterwards?”\\n\\n“Well, I don’t know, sir, I expect she would lock it up in that purple\\ncase of hers.”\\n\\n“Is that where she usually kept important papers?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir. She brought it down with her every morning, and took it up\\nevery night.”\\n\\n“When did she lose the key of it?”\\n\\n“She missed it yesterday at lunch-time, sir, and told me to look\\ncarefully for it. She was very much put out about it.”\\n\\n“But she had a duplicate key?”\\n\\n“Oh, yes, sir.”\\n\\nDorcas was looking very curiously at him and, to tell the truth, so was\\nI. What was all this about a lost key? Poirot smiled.\\n\\n“Never mind, Dorcas, it is my business to know things. Is this the key\\nthat was lost?” He drew from his pocket the key that he had found in\\nthe lock of the despatch-case upstairs.\\n\\nDorcas’s eyes looked as though they would pop out of her head.\\n\\n“That’s it, sir, right enough. But where did you find it? I looked\\neverywhere for it.”\\n\\n“Ah, but you see it was not in the same place yesterday as it was\\nto-day. Now, to pass to another subject, had your mistress a dark green\\ndress in her wardrobe?”\\n\\nDorcas was rather startled by the unexpected question.\\n\\n“No, sir.”\\n\\n“Are you quite sure?”\\n\\n“Oh, yes, sir.”\\n\\n“Has anyone else in the house got a green dress?”\\n\\nDorcas reflected.\\n\\n“Miss Cynthia has a green evening dress.”\\n\\n“Light or dark green?”\\n\\n“A light green, sir; a sort of chiffon, they call it.”\\n\\n“Ah, that is not what I want. And nobody else has anything green?”\\n\\n“No, sir—not that I know of.”\\n\\nPoirot’s face did not betray a trace of whether he was disappointed or\\notherwise. He merely remarked:\\n\\n“Good, we will leave that and pass on. Have you any reason to believe\\nthat your mistress was likely to take a sleeping powder last night?”\\n\\n“Not _last_ night, sir, I know she didn’t.”\\n\\n“Why do you know so positively?”\\n\\n“Because the box was empty. She took the last one two days ago, and she\\ndidn’t have any more made up.”\\n\\n“You are quite sure of that?”\\n\\n“Positive, sir.”\\n\\n“Then that is cleared up! By the way, your mistress didn’t ask you to\\nsign any paper yesterday?”\\n\\n“To sign a paper? No, sir.”\\n\\n“When Mr. Hastings and Mr. Lawrence came in yesterday evening, they\\nfound your mistress busy writing letters. I suppose you can give me no\\nidea to whom these letters were addressed?”\\n\\n“I’m afraid I couldn’t, sir. I was out in the evening. Perhaps Annie\\ncould tell you, though she’s a careless girl. Never cleared the\\ncoffee-cups away last night. That’s what happens when I’m not here to\\nlook after things.”\\n\\nPoirot lifted his hand.\\n\\n“Since they have been left, Dorcas, leave them a little longer, I pray\\nyou. I should like to examine them.”\\n\\n“Very well, sir.”\\n\\n“What time did you go out last evening?”\\n\\n“About six o’clock, sir.”\\n\\n“Thank you, Dorcas, that is all I have to ask you.” He rose and\\nstrolled to the window. “I have been admiring these flower beds. How\\nmany gardeners are employed here, by the way?”\\n\\n“Only three now, sir. Five, we had, before the war, when it was kept as\\na gentleman’s place should be. I wish you could have seen it then, sir.\\nA fair sight it was. But now there’s only old Manning, and young\\nWilliam, and a new-fashioned woman gardener in breeches and such-like.\\nAh, these are dreadful times!”\\n\\n“The good times will come again, Dorcas. At least, we hope so. Now,\\nwill you send Annie to me here?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.”\\n\\n“How did you know that Mrs. Inglethorp took sleeping powders?” I asked,\\nin lively curiosity, as Dorcas left the room. “And about the lost key\\nand the duplicate?”\\n\\n“One thing at a time. As to the sleeping powders, I knew by this.” He\\nsuddenly produced a small cardboard box, such as chemists use for\\npowders.\\n\\n“Where did you find it?”\\n\\n“In the wash-stand drawer in Mrs. Inglethorp’s bedroom. It was Number\\nSix of my catalogue.”\\n\\n“But I suppose, as the last powder was taken two days ago, it is not of\\nmuch importance?”\\n\\n“Probably not, but do you notice anything that strikes you as peculiar\\nabout this box?”\\n\\nI examined it closely.\\n\\n“No, I can’t say that I do.”\\n\\n“Look at the label.”\\n\\nI read the label carefully: “‘One powder to be taken at bedtime, if\\nrequired. Mrs. Inglethorp.’ No, I see nothing unusual.”\\n\\n“Not the fact that there is no chemist’s name?”\\n\\n“Ah!” I exclaimed. “To be sure, that is odd!”\\n\\n“Have you ever known a chemist to send out a box like that, without his\\nprinted name?”\\n\\n“No, I can’t say that I have.”\\n\\nI was becoming quite excited, but Poirot damped my ardour by remarking:\\n\\n“Yet the explanation is quite simple. So do not intrigue yourself, my\\nfriend.”\\n\\nAn audible creaking proclaimed the approach of Annie, so I had no time\\nto reply.\\n\\nAnnie was a fine, strapping girl, and was evidently labouring under\\nintense excitement, mingled with a certain ghoulish enjoyment of the\\ntragedy.\\n\\nPoirot came to the point at once, with a business-like briskness.\\n\\n“I sent for you, Annie, because I thought you might be able to tell me\\nsomething about the letters Mrs. Inglethorp wrote last night. How many\\nwere there? And can you tell me any of the names and addresses?”\\n\\nAnnie considered.\\n\\n“There were four letters, sir. One was to Miss Howard, and one was to\\nMr. Wells, the lawyer, and the other two I don’t think I remember,\\nsir—oh, yes, one was to Ross’s, the caterers in Tadminster. The other\\none, I don’t remember.”\\n\\n“Think,” urged Poirot.\\n\\nAnnie racked her brains in vain.\\n\\n“I’m sorry, sir, but it’s clean gone. I don’t think I can have noticed\\nit.”\\n\\n“It does not matter,” said Poirot, not betraying any sign of\\ndisappointment. “Now I want to ask you about something else. There is a\\nsaucepan in Mrs. Inglethorp’s room with some cocoa in it. Did she have\\nthat every night?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir, it was put in her room every evening, and she warmed it up\\nin the night—whenever she fancied it.”\\n\\n“What was it? Plain cocoa?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir, made with milk, with a teaspoonful of sugar, and two\\nteaspoonfuls of rum in it.”\\n\\n“Who took it to her room?”\\n\\n“I did, sir.”\\n\\n“Always?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir.”\\n\\n“At what time?”\\n\\n“When I went to draw the curtains, as a rule, sir.”\\n\\n“Did you bring it straight up from the kitchen then?”\\n\\n“No, sir, you see there’s not much room on the gas stove, so cook used\\nto make it early, before putting the vegetables on for supper. Then I\\nused to bring it up, and put it on the table by the swing door, and\\ntake it into her room later.”\\n\\n“The swing door is in the left wing, is it not?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir.”\\n\\n“And the table, is it on this side of the door, or on the\\nfarther—servants’ side?”\\n\\n“It’s this side, sir.”\\n\\n“What time did you bring it up last night?”\\n\\n“About quarter-past seven, I should say, sir.”\\n\\n“And when did you take it into Mrs. Inglethorp’s room?”\\n\\n“When I went to shut up, sir. About eight o’clock. Mrs. Inglethorp came\\nup to bed before I’d finished.”\\n\\n“Then, between seven-fifteen and eight o’clock, the cocoa was standing\\non the table in the left wing?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir.” Annie had been growing redder and redder in the face, and\\nnow she blurted out unexpectedly:\\n\\n“And if there _was_ salt in it, sir, it wasn’t me. I never took the\\nsalt near it.”\\n\\n“What makes you think there was salt in it?” asked Poirot.\\n\\n“Seeing it on the tray, sir.”\\n\\n“You saw some salt on the tray?”\\n\\n“Yes. Coarse kitchen salt, it looked. I never noticed it when I took\\nthe tray up, but when I came to take it into the mistress’s room I saw\\nit at once, and I suppose I ought to have taken it down again, and\\nasked cook to make some fresh. But I was in a hurry, because Dorcas was\\nout, and I thought maybe the cocoa itself was all right, and the salt\\nhad only gone on the tray. So I dusted it off with my apron, and took\\nit in.”\\n\\nI had the utmost difficulty in controlling my excitement. Unknown to\\nherself, Annie had provided us with an important piece of evidence. How\\nshe would have gaped if she had realized that her “coarse kitchen salt”\\nwas strychnine, one of the most deadly poisons known to mankind. I\\nmarvelled at Poirot’s calm. His self-control was astonishing. I awaited\\nhis next question with impatience, but it disappointed me.\\n\\n“When you went into Mrs. Inglethorp’s room, was the door leading into\\nMiss Cynthia’s room bolted?”\\n\\n“Oh! Yes, sir; it always was. It had never been opened.”\\n\\n“And the door into Mr. Inglethorp’s room? Did you notice if that was\\nbolted too?”\\n\\nAnnie hesitated.\\n\\n“I couldn’t rightly say, sir; it was shut but I couldn’t say whether it\\nwas bolted or not.”\\n\\n“When you finally left the room, did Mrs. Inglethorp bolt the door\\nafter you?”\\n\\n“No, sir, not then, but I expect she did later. She usually did lock it\\nat night. The door into the passage, that is.”\\n\\n“Did you notice any candle grease on the floor when you did the room\\nyesterday?”\\n\\n“Candle grease? Oh, no, sir. Mrs. Inglethorp didn’t have a candle, only\\na reading-lamp.”\\n\\n“Then, if there had been a large patch of candle grease on the floor,\\nyou think you would have been sure to have seen it?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir, and I would have taken it out with a piece of blotting-paper\\nand a hot iron.”\\n\\nThen Poirot repeated the question he had put to Dorcas:\\n\\n“Did your mistress ever have a green dress?”\\n\\n“No, sir.”\\n\\n“Nor a mantle, nor a cape, nor a—how do you call it?—a sports coat?”\\n\\n“Not green, sir.”\\n\\n“Nor anyone else in the house?”\\n\\nAnnie reflected.\\n\\n“No, sir.”\\n\\n“You are sure of that?”\\n\\n“Quite sure.”\\n\\n“_Bien!_ That is all I want to know. Thank you very much.”\\n\\nWith a nervous giggle, Annie took herself creakingly out of the room.\\nMy pent-up excitement burst forth.\\n\\n“Poirot,” I cried, “I congratulate you! This is a great discovery.”\\n\\n“What is a great discovery?”\\n\\n“Why, that it was the cocoa and not the coffee that was poisoned. That\\nexplains everything! Of course it did not take effect until the early\\nmorning, since the cocoa was only drunk in the middle of the night.”\\n\\n“So you think that the cocoa—mark well what I say, Hastings, the\\n_cocoa_—contained strychnine?”\\n\\n“Of course! That salt on the tray, what else could it have been?”\\n\\n“It might have been salt,” replied Poirot placidly.\\n\\nI shrugged my shoulders. If he was going to take the matter that way,\\nit was no good arguing with him. The idea crossed my mind, not for the\\nfirst time, that poor old Poirot was growing old. Privately I thought\\nit lucky that he had associated with him someone of a more receptive\\ntype of mind.\\n\\nPoirot was surveying me with quietly twinkling eyes.\\n\\n“You are not pleased with me, _mon ami?_”\\n\\n“My dear Poirot,” I said coldly, “it is not for me to dictate to you.\\nYou have a right to your own opinion, just as I have to mine.”\\n\\n“A most admirable sentiment,” remarked Poirot, rising briskly to his\\nfeet. “Now I have finished with this room. By the way, whose is the\\nsmaller desk in the corner?”\\n\\n“Mr. Inglethorp’s.”\\n\\n“Ah!” He tried the roll top tentatively. “Locked. But perhaps one of\\nMrs. Inglethorp’s keys would open it.” He tried several, twisting and\\nturning them with a practiced hand, and finally uttering an ejaculation\\nof satisfaction. “_Voilà!_ It is not the key, but it will open it at a\\npinch.” He slid back the roll top, and ran a rapid eye over the neatly\\nfiled papers. To my surprise, he did not examine them, merely remarking\\napprovingly as he relocked the desk: “Decidedly, he is a man of method,\\nthis Mr. Inglethorp!”\\n\\nA “man of method” was, in Poirot’s estimation, the highest praise that\\ncould be bestowed on any individual.\\n\\nI felt that my friend was not what he had been as he rambled on\\ndisconnectedly:\\n\\n“There were no stamps in his desk, but there might have been, eh, _mon\\nami?_ There might have been? Yes”—his eyes wandered round the\\nroom—“this boudoir has nothing more to tell us. It did not yield much.\\nOnly this.”\\n\\nHe pulled a crumpled envelope out of his pocket, and tossed it over to\\nme. It was rather a curious document. A plain, dirty looking old\\nenvelope with a few words scrawled across it, apparently at random. The\\nfollowing is a facsimile of it.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V.\\n“IT ISN’T STRYCHNINE, IS IT?”\\n\\n\\n“Where did you find this?” I asked Poirot, in lively curiosity.\\n\\n“In the waste-paper basket. You recognise the handwriting?”\\n\\n“Yes, it is Mrs. Inglethorp’s. But what does it mean?”\\n\\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n“I cannot say—but it is suggestive.”\\n\\nA wild idea flashed across me. Was it possible that Mrs. Inglethorp’s\\nmind was deranged? Had she some fantastic idea of demoniacal\\npossession? And, if that were so, was it not also possible that she\\nmight have taken her own life?\\n\\nI was about to expound these theories to Poirot, when his own words\\ndistracted me.\\n\\n“Come,” he said, “now to examine the coffee-cups!”\\n\\n“My dear Poirot! What on earth is the good of that, now that we know\\nabout the cocoa?”\\n\\n“Oh, _là là!_ That miserable cocoa!” cried Poirot flippantly.\\n\\nHe laughed with apparent enjoyment, raising his arms to heaven in mock\\ndespair, in what I could not but consider the worst possible taste.\\n\\n“And, anyway,” I said, with increasing coldness, “as Mrs. Inglethorp\\ntook her coffee upstairs with her, I do not see what you expect to\\nfind, unless you consider it likely that we shall discover a packet of\\nstrychnine on the coffee tray!”\\n\\nPoirot was sobered at once.\\n\\n“Come, come, my friend,” he said, slipping his arms through mine. “_Ne\\nvous fâchez pas!_ Allow me to interest myself in my coffee-cups, and I\\nwill respect your cocoa. There! Is it a bargain?”\\n\\nHe was so quaintly humorous that I was forced to laugh; and we went\\ntogether to the drawing-room, where the coffee-cups and tray remained\\nundisturbed as we had left them.\\n\\nPoirot made me recapitulate the scene of the night before, listening\\nvery carefully, and verifying the position of the various cups.\\n\\n“So Mrs. Cavendish stood by the tray—and poured out. Yes. Then she came\\nacross to the window where you sat with Mademoiselle Cynthia. Yes. Here\\nare the three cups. And the cup on the mantelpiece, half drunk, that\\nwould be Mr. Lawrence Cavendish’s. And the one on the tray?”\\n\\n“John Cavendish’s. I saw him put it down there.”\\n\\n“Good. One, two, three, four, five—but where, then, is the cup of Mr.\\nInglethorp?”\\n\\n“He does not take coffee.”\\n\\n“Then all are accounted for. One moment, my friend.”\\n\\nWith infinite care, he took a drop or two from the grounds in each cup,\\nsealing them up in separate test tubes, tasting each in turn as he did\\nso. His physiognomy underwent a curious change. An expression gathered\\nthere that I can only describe as half puzzled, and half relieved.\\n\\n“_Bien!_” he said at last. “It is evident! I had an idea—but clearly I\\nwas mistaken. Yes, altogether I was mistaken. Yet it is strange. But no\\nmatter!”\\n\\nAnd, with a characteristic shrug, he dismissed whatever it was that was\\nworrying him from his mind. I could have told him from the beginning\\nthat this obsession of his over the coffee was bound to end in a blind\\nalley, but I restrained my tongue. After all, though he was old, Poirot\\nhad been a great man in his day.\\n\\n“Breakfast is ready,” said John Cavendish, coming in from the hall.\\n“You will breakfast with us, Monsieur Poirot?”\\n\\nPoirot acquiesced. I observed John. Already he was almost restored to\\nhis normal self. The shock of the events of the last night had upset\\nhim temporarily, but his equable poise soon swung back to the normal.\\nHe was a man of very little imagination, in sharp contrast with his\\nbrother, who had, perhaps, too much.\\n\\nEver since the early hours of the morning, John had been hard at work,\\nsending telegrams—one of the first had gone to Evelyn Howard—writing\\nnotices for the papers, and generally occupying himself with the\\nmelancholy duties that a death entails.\\n\\n“May I ask how things are proceeding?” he said. “Do your investigations\\npoint to my mother having died a natural death—or—or must we prepare\\nourselves for the worst?”\\n\\n“I think, Mr. Cavendish,” said Poirot gravely, “that you would do well\\nnot to buoy yourself up with any false hopes. Can you tell me the views\\nof the other members of the family?”\\n\\n“My brother Lawrence is convinced that we are making a fuss over\\nnothing. He says that everything points to its being a simple case of\\nheart failure.”\\n\\n“He does, does he? That is very interesting—very interesting,” murmured\\nPoirot softly. “And Mrs. Cavendish?”\\n\\nA faint cloud passed over John’s face.\\n\\n“I have not the least idea what my wife’s views on the subject are.”\\n\\nThe answer brought a momentary stiffness in its train. John broke the\\nrather awkward silence by saying with a slight effort:\\n\\n“I told you, didn’t I, that Mr. Inglethorp has returned?”\\n\\nPoirot bent his head.\\n\\n“It’s an awkward position for all of us. Of course one has to treat him\\nas usual—but, hang it all, one’s gorge does rise at sitting down to eat\\nwith a possible murderer!”\\n\\nPoirot nodded sympathetically.\\n\\n“I quite understand. It is a very difficult situation for you, Mr.\\nCavendish. I would like to ask you one question. Mr. Inglethorp’s\\nreason for not returning last night was, I believe, that he had\\nforgotten the latch-key. Is not that so?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“I suppose you are quite sure that the latch-key _was_ forgotten—that\\nhe did not take it after all?”\\n\\n“I have no idea. I never thought of looking. We always keep it in the\\nhall drawer. I’ll go and see if it’s there now.”\\n\\nPoirot held up his hand with a faint smile.\\n\\n“No, no, Mr. Cavendish, it is too late now. I am certain that you would\\nfind it. If Mr. Inglethorp did take it, he has had ample time to\\nreplace it by now.”\\n\\n“But do you think——”\\n\\n“I think nothing. If anyone had chanced to look this morning before his\\nreturn, and seen it there, it would have been a valuable point in his\\nfavour. That is all.”\\n\\nJohn looked perplexed.\\n\\n“Do not worry,” said Poirot smoothly. “I assure you that you need not\\nlet it trouble you. Since you are so kind, let us go and have some\\nbreakfast.”\\n\\nEveryone was assembled in the dining-room. Under the circumstances, we\\nwere naturally not a cheerful party. The reaction after a shock is\\nalways trying, and I think we were all suffering from it. Decorum and\\ngood breeding naturally enjoined that our demeanour should be much as\\nusual, yet I could not help wondering if this self-control were really\\na matter of great difficulty. There were no red eyes, no signs of\\nsecretly indulged grief. I felt that I was right in my opinion that\\nDorcas was the person most affected by the personal side of the\\ntragedy.\\n\\nI pass over Alfred Inglethorp, who acted the bereaved widower in a\\nmanner that I felt to be disgusting in its hypocrisy. Did he know that\\nwe suspected him, I wondered. Surely he could not be unaware of the\\nfact, conceal it as we would. Did he feel some secret stirring of fear,\\nor was he confident that his crime would go unpunished? Surely the\\nsuspicion in the atmosphere must warn him that he was already a marked\\nman.\\n\\nBut did everyone suspect him? What about Mrs. Cavendish? I watched her\\nas she sat at the head of the table, graceful, composed, enigmatic. In\\nher soft grey frock, with white ruffles at the wrists falling over her\\nslender hands, she looked very beautiful. When she chose, however, her\\nface could be sphinx-like in its inscrutability. She was very silent,\\nhardly opening her lips, and yet in some queer way I felt that the\\ngreat strength of her personality was dominating us all.\\n\\nAnd little Cynthia? Did she suspect? She looked very tired and ill, I\\nthought. The heaviness and languor of her manner were very marked. I\\nasked her if she were feeling ill, and she answered frankly:\\n\\n“Yes, I’ve got the most beastly headache.”\\n\\n“Have another cup of coffee, mademoiselle?” said Poirot solicitously.\\n“It will revive you. It is unparalleled for the _mal de tête_.” He\\njumped up and took her cup.\\n\\n“No sugar,” said Cynthia, watching him, as he picked up the\\nsugar-tongs.\\n\\n“No sugar? You abandon it in the war-time, eh?”\\n\\n“No, I never take it in coffee.”\\n\\n“_Sacré!_” murmured Poirot to himself, as he brought back the\\nreplenished cup.\\n\\nOnly I heard him, and glancing up curiously at the little man I saw\\nthat his face was working with suppressed excitement, and his eyes were\\nas green as a cat’s. He had heard or seen something that had affected\\nhim strongly—but what was it? I do not usually label myself as dense,\\nbut I must confess that nothing out of the ordinary had attracted _my_\\nattention.\\n\\nIn another moment, the door opened and Dorcas appeared.\\n\\n“Mr. Wells to see you, sir,” she said to John.\\n\\nI remembered the name as being that of the lawyer to whom Mrs.\\nInglethorp had written the night before.\\n\\nJohn rose immediately.\\n\\n“Show him into my study.” Then he turned to us. “My mother’s lawyer,”\\nhe explained. And in a lower voice: “He is also Coroner—you understand.\\nPerhaps you would like to come with me?”\\n\\nWe acquiesced and followed him out of the room. John strode on ahead\\nand I took the opportunity of whispering to Poirot:\\n\\n“There will be an inquest then?”\\n\\nPoirot nodded absently. He seemed absorbed in thought; so much so that\\nmy curiosity was aroused.\\n\\n“What is it? You are not attending to what I say.”\\n\\n“It is true, my friend. I am much worried.”\\n\\n“Why?”\\n\\n“Because Mademoiselle Cynthia does not take sugar in her coffee.”\\n\\n“What? You cannot be serious?”\\n\\n“But I am most serious. Ah, there is something there that I do not\\nunderstand. My instinct was right.”\\n\\n“What instinct?”\\n\\n“The instinct that led me to insist on examining those coffee-cups.\\n_Chut!_ no more now!”\\n\\nWe followed John into his study, and he closed the door behind us.\\n\\nMr. Wells was a pleasant man of middle-age, with keen eyes, and the\\ntypical lawyer’s mouth. John introduced us both, and explained the\\nreason of our presence.\\n\\n“You will understand, Wells,” he added, “that this is all strictly\\nprivate. We are still hoping that there will turn out to be no need for\\ninvestigation of any kind.”\\n\\n“Quite so, quite so,” said Mr. Wells soothingly. “I wish we could have\\nspared you the pain and publicity of an inquest, but of course it’s\\nquite unavoidable in the absence of a doctor’s certificate.”\\n\\n“Yes, I suppose so.”\\n\\n“Clever man, Bauerstein. Great authority on toxicology, I believe.”\\n\\n“Indeed,” said John with a certain stiffness in his manner. Then he\\nadded rather hesitatingly: “Shall we have to appear as witnesses—all of\\nus, I mean?”\\n\\n“You, of course—and ah—er—Mr.—er—Inglethorp.”\\n\\nA slight pause ensued before the lawyer went on in his soothing manner:\\n\\n“Any other evidence will be simply confirmatory, a mere matter of\\nform.”\\n\\n“I see.”\\n\\nA faint expression of relief swept over John’s face. It puzzled me, for\\nI saw no occasion for it.\\n\\n“If you know of nothing to the contrary,” pursued Mr. Wells, “I had\\nthought of Friday. That will give us plenty of time for the doctor’s\\nreport. The post-mortem is to take place to-night, I believe?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“Then that arrangement will suit you?”\\n\\n“Perfectly.”\\n\\n“I need not tell you, my dear Cavendish, how distressed I am at this\\nmost tragic affair.”\\n\\n“Can you give us no help in solving it, monsieur?” interposed Poirot,\\nspeaking for the first time since we had entered the room.\\n\\n“I?”\\n\\n“Yes, we heard that Mrs. Inglethorp wrote to you last night. You should\\nhave received the letter this morning.”\\n\\n“I did, but it contains no information. It is merely a note asking me\\nto call upon her this morning, as she wanted my advice on a matter of\\ngreat importance.”\\n\\n“She gave you no hint as to what that matter might be?”\\n\\n“Unfortunately, no.”\\n\\n“That is a pity,” said John.\\n\\n“A great pity,” agreed Poirot gravely.\\n\\nThere was silence. Poirot remained lost in thought for a few minutes.\\nFinally he turned to the lawyer again.\\n\\n“Mr. Wells, there is one thing I should like to ask you—that is, if it\\nis not against professional etiquette. In the event of Mrs.\\nInglethorp’s death, who would inherit her money?”\\n\\nThe lawyer hesitated a moment, and then replied:\\n\\n“The knowledge will be public property very soon, so if Mr. Cavendish\\ndoes not object——”\\n\\n“Not at all,” interpolated John.\\n\\n“I do not see any reason why I should not answer your question. By her\\nlast will, dated August of last year, after various unimportant\\nlegacies to servants, etc., she gave her entire fortune to her stepson,\\nMr. John Cavendish.”\\n\\n“Was not that—pardon the question, Mr. Cavendish—rather unfair to her\\nother stepson, Mr. Lawrence Cavendish?”\\n\\n“No, I do not think so. You see, under the terms of their father’s\\nwill, while John inherited the property, Lawrence, at his stepmother’s\\ndeath, would come into a considerable sum of money. Mrs. Inglethorp\\nleft her money to her elder stepson, knowing that he would have to keep\\nup Styles. It was, to my mind, a very fair and equitable distribution.”\\n\\nPoirot nodded thoughtfully.\\n\\n“I see. But I am right in saying, am I not, that by your English law\\nthat will was automatically revoked when Mrs. Inglethorp remarried?”\\n\\nMr. Wells bowed his head.\\n\\n“As I was about to proceed, Monsieur Poirot, that document is now null\\nand void.”\\n\\n“_Hein!_” said Poirot. He reflected for a moment, and then asked: “Was\\nMrs. Inglethorp herself aware of that fact?”\\n\\n“I do not know. She may have been.”\\n\\n“She was,” said John unexpectedly. “We were discussing the matter of\\nwills being revoked by marriage only yesterday.”\\n\\n“Ah! One more question, Mr. Wells. You say ‘her last will.’ Had Mrs.\\nInglethorp, then, made several former wills?”\\n\\n“On an average, she made a new will at least once a year,” said Mr.\\nWells imperturbably. “She was given to changing her mind as to her\\ntestamentary dispositions, now benefiting one, now another member of\\nher family.”\\n\\n“Suppose,” suggested Poirot, “that, unknown to you, she had made a new\\nwill in favour of someone who was not, in any sense of the word, a\\nmember of the family—we will say Miss Howard, for instance—would you be\\nsurprised?”\\n\\n“Not in the least.”\\n\\n“Ah!” Poirot seemed to have exhausted his questions.\\n\\nI drew close to him, while John and the lawyer were debating the\\nquestion of going through Mrs. Inglethorp’s papers.\\n\\n“Do you think Mrs. Inglethorp made a will leaving all her money to Miss\\nHoward?” I asked in a low voice, with some curiosity.\\n\\nPoirot smiled.\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“Then why did you ask?”\\n\\n“Hush!”\\n\\nJohn Cavendish had turned to Poirot.\\n\\n“Will you come with us, Monsieur Poirot? We are going through my\\nmother’s papers. Mr. Inglethorp is quite willing to leave it entirely\\nto Mr. Wells and myself.”\\n\\n“Which simplifies matters very much,” murmured the lawyer. “As\\ntechnically, of course, he was entitled——” He did not finish the\\nsentence.\\n\\n“We will look through the desk in the boudoir first,” explained John,\\n“and go up to her bedroom afterwards. She kept her most important\\npapers in a purple despatch-case, which we must look through\\ncarefully.”\\n\\n“Yes,” said the lawyer, “it is quite possible that there may be a later\\nwill than the one in my possession.”\\n\\n“There _is_ a later will.” It was Poirot who spoke.\\n\\n“What?” John and the lawyer looked at him startled.\\n\\n“Or, rather,” pursued my friend imperturbably, “there _was_ one.”\\n\\n“What do you mean—there was one? Where is it now?”\\n\\n“Burnt!”\\n\\n“Burnt?”\\n\\n“Yes. See here.” He took out the charred fragment we had found in the\\ngrate in Mrs. Inglethorp’s room, and handed it to the lawyer with a\\nbrief explanation of when and where he had found it.\\n\\n“But possibly this is an old will?”\\n\\n“I do not think so. In fact I am almost certain that it was made no\\nearlier than yesterday afternoon.”\\n\\n“What?” “Impossible!” broke simultaneously from both men.\\n\\nPoirot turned to John.\\n\\n“If you will allow me to send for your gardener, I will prove it to\\nyou.”\\n\\n“Oh, of course—but I don’t see——”\\n\\nPoirot raised his hand.\\n\\n“Do as I ask you. Afterwards you shall question as much as you please.”\\n\\n“Very well.” He rang the bell.\\n\\nDorcas answered it in due course.\\n\\n“Dorcas, will you tell Manning to come round and speak to me here.”\\n\\n“Yes, sir.”\\n\\nDorcas withdrew.\\n\\nWe waited in a tense silence. Poirot alone seemed perfectly at his\\nease, and dusted a forgotten corner of the bookcase.\\n\\nThe clumping of hobnailed boots on the gravel outside proclaimed the\\napproach of Manning. John looked questioningly at Poirot. The latter\\nnodded.\\n\\n“Come inside, Manning,” said John, “I want to speak to you.”\\n\\nManning came slowly and hesitatingly through the French window, and\\nstood as near it as he could. He held his cap in his hands, twisting it\\nvery carefully round and round. His back was much bent, though he was\\nprobably not as old as he looked, but his eyes were sharp and\\nintelligent, and belied his slow and rather cautious speech.\\n\\n“Manning,” said John, “this gentleman will put some questions to you\\nwhich I want you to answer.”\\n\\n“Yessir,” mumbled Manning.\\n\\nPoirot stepped forward briskly. Manning’s eye swept over him with a\\nfaint contempt.\\n\\n“You were planting a bed of begonias round by the south side of the\\nhouse yesterday afternoon, were you not, Manning?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir, me and Willum.”\\n\\n“And Mrs. Inglethorp came to the window and called you, did she not?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir, she did.”\\n\\n“Tell me in your own words exactly what happened after that.”\\n\\n“Well, sir, nothing much. She just told Willum to go on his bicycle\\ndown to the village, and bring back a form of will, or such-like—I\\ndon’t know what exactly—she wrote it down for him.”\\n\\n“Well?”\\n\\n“Well, he did, sir.”\\n\\n“And what happened next?”\\n\\n“We went on with the begonias, sir.”\\n\\n“Did not Mrs. Inglethorp call you again?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir, both me and Willum, she called.”\\n\\n“And then?”\\n\\n“She made us come right in, and sign our names at the bottom of a long\\npaper—under where she’d signed.”\\n\\n“Did you see anything of what was written above her signature?” asked\\nPoirot sharply.\\n\\n“No, sir, there was a bit of blotting paper over that part.”\\n\\n“And you signed where she told you?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir, first me and then Willum.”\\n\\n“What did she do with it afterwards?”\\n\\n“Well, sir, she slipped it into a long envelope, and put it inside a\\nsort of purple box that was standing on the desk.”\\n\\n“What time was it when she first called you?”\\n\\n“About four, I should say, sir.”\\n\\n“Not earlier? Couldn’t it have been about half-past three?”\\n\\n“No, I shouldn’t say so, sir. It would be more likely to be a bit after\\nfour—not before it.”\\n\\n“Thank you, Manning, that will do,” said Poirot pleasantly.\\n\\nThe gardener glanced at his master, who nodded, whereupon Manning\\nlifted a finger to his forehead with a low mumble, and backed\\ncautiously out of the window.\\n\\nWe all looked at each other.\\n\\n“Good heavens!” murmured John. “What an extraordinary coincidence.”\\n\\n“How—a coincidence?”\\n\\n“That my mother should have made a will on the very day of her death!”\\n\\nMr. Wells cleared his throat and remarked drily:\\n\\n“Are you so sure it is a coincidence, Cavendish?”\\n\\n“What do you mean?”\\n\\n“Your mother, you tell me, had a violent quarrel with—someone yesterday\\nafternoon——”\\n\\n“What do you mean?” cried John again. There was a tremor in his voice,\\nand he had gone very pale.\\n\\n“In consequence of that quarrel, your mother very suddenly and\\nhurriedly makes a new will. The contents of that will we shall never\\nknow. She told no one of its provisions. This morning, no doubt, she\\nwould have consulted me on the subject—but she had no chance. The will\\ndisappears, and she takes its secret with her to her grave. Cavendish,\\nI much fear there is no coincidence there. Monsieur Poirot, I am sure\\nyou agree with me that the facts are very suggestive.”\\n\\n“Suggestive, or not,” interrupted John, “we are most grateful to\\nMonsieur Poirot for elucidating the matter. But for him, we should\\nnever have known of this will. I suppose, I may not ask you, monsieur,\\nwhat first led you to suspect the fact?”\\n\\nPoirot smiled and answered:\\n\\n“A scribbled over old envelope, and a freshly planted bed of begonias.”\\n\\nJohn, I think, would have pressed his questions further, but at that\\nmoment the loud purr of a motor was audible, and we all turned to the\\nwindow as it swept past.\\n\\n“Evie!” cried John. “Excuse me, Wells.” He went hurriedly out into the\\nhall.\\n\\nPoirot looked inquiringly at me.\\n\\n“Miss Howard,” I explained.\\n\\n“Ah, I am glad she has come. There is a woman with a head and a heart\\ntoo, Hastings. Though the good God gave her no beauty!”\\n\\nI followed John’s example, and went out into the hall, where Miss\\nHoward was endeavouring to extricate herself from the voluminous mass\\nof veils that enveloped her head. As her eyes fell on me, a sudden pang\\nof guilt shot through me. This was the woman who had warned me so\\nearnestly, and to whose warning I had, alas, paid no heed! How soon,\\nand how contemptuously, I had dismissed it from my mind. Now that she\\nhad been proved justified in so tragic a manner, I felt ashamed. She\\nhad known Alfred Inglethorp only too well. I wondered whether, if she\\nhad remained at Styles, the tragedy would have taken place, or would\\nthe man have feared her watchful eyes?\\n\\nI was relieved when she shook me by the hand, with her well remembered\\npainful grip. The eyes that met mine were sad, but not reproachful;\\nthat she had been crying bitterly, I could tell by the redness of her\\neyelids, but her manner was unchanged from its old gruffness.\\n\\n“Started the moment I got the wire. Just come off night duty. Hired\\ncar. Quickest way to get here.”\\n\\n“Have you had anything to eat this morning, Evie?” asked John.\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“I thought not. Come along, breakfast’s not cleared away yet, and\\nthey’ll make you some fresh tea.” He turned to me. “Look after her,\\nHastings, will you? Wells is waiting for me. Oh, here’s Monsieur\\nPoirot. He’s helping us, you know, Evie.”\\n\\nMiss Howard shook hands with Poirot, but glanced suspiciously over her\\nshoulder at John.\\n\\n“What do you mean—helping us?”\\n\\n“Helping us to investigate.”\\n\\n“Nothing to investigate. Have they taken him to prison yet?”\\n\\n“Taken who to prison?”\\n\\n“Who? Alfred Inglethorp, of course!”\\n\\n“My dear Evie, do be careful. Lawrence is of the opinion that my mother\\ndied from heart seizure.”\\n\\n“More fool, Lawrence!” retorted Miss Howard. “Of course Alfred\\nInglethorp murdered poor Emily—as I always told you he would.”\\n\\n“My dear Evie, don’t shout so. Whatever we may think or suspect, it is\\nbetter to say as little as possible for the present. The inquest isn’t\\nuntil Friday.”\\n\\n“Not until fiddlesticks!” The snort Miss Howard gave was truly\\nmagnificent. “You’re all off your heads. The man will be out of the\\ncountry by then. If he’s any sense, he won’t stay here tamely and wait\\nto be hanged.”\\n\\nJohn Cavendish looked at her helplessly.\\n\\n“I know what it is,” she accused him, “you’ve been listening to the\\ndoctors. Never should. What do they know? Nothing at all—or just enough\\nto make them dangerous. I ought to know—my own father was a doctor.\\nThat little Wilkins is about the greatest fool that even I have ever\\nseen. Heart seizure! Sort of thing he would say. Anyone with any sense\\ncould see at once that her husband had poisoned her. I always said he’d\\nmurder her in her bed, poor soul. Now he’s done it. And all you can do\\nis to murmur silly things about ‘heart seizure’ and ‘inquest on\\nFriday.’ You ought to be ashamed of yourself, John Cavendish.”\\n\\n“What do you want me to do?” asked John, unable to help a faint smile.\\n“Dash it all, Evie, I can’t haul him down to the local police station\\nby the scruff of his neck.”\\n\\n“Well, you might do something. Find out how he did it. He’s a crafty\\nbeggar. Dare say he soaked fly papers. Ask cook if she’s missed any.”\\n\\nIt occurred to me very forcibly at that moment that to harbour Miss\\nHoward and Alfred Inglethorp under the same roof, and keep the peace\\nbetween them, was likely to prove a Herculean task, and I did not envy\\nJohn. I could see by the expression of his face that he fully\\nappreciated the difficulty of the position. For the moment, he sought\\nrefuge in retreat, and left the room precipitately.\\n\\nDorcas brought in fresh tea. As she left the room, Poirot came over\\nfrom the window where he had been standing, and sat down facing Miss\\nHoward.\\n\\n“Mademoiselle,” he said gravely, “I want to ask you something.”\\n\\n“Ask away,” said the lady, eyeing him with some disfavour.\\n\\n“I want to be able to count upon your help.”\\n\\n“I’ll help you to hang Alfred with pleasure,” she replied gruffly.\\n“Hanging’s too good for him. Ought to be drawn and quartered, like in\\ngood old times.”\\n\\n“We are at one then,” said Poirot, “for I, too, want to hang the\\ncriminal.”\\n\\n“Alfred Inglethorp?”\\n\\n“Him, or another.”\\n\\n“No question of another. Poor Emily was never murdered until _he_ came\\nalong. I don’t say she wasn’t surrounded by sharks—she was. But it was\\nonly her purse they were after. Her life was safe enough. But along\\ncomes Mr. Alfred Inglethorp—and within two months—hey presto!”\\n\\n“Believe me, Miss Howard,” said Poirot very earnestly, “if Mr.\\nInglethorp is the man, he shall not escape me. On my honour, I will\\nhang him as high as Haman!”\\n\\n“That’s better,” said Miss Howard more enthusiastically.\\n\\n“But I must ask you to trust me. Now your help may be very valuable to\\nme. I will tell you why. Because, in all this house of mourning, yours\\nare the only eyes that have wept.”\\n\\nMiss Howard blinked, and a new note crept into the gruffness of her\\nvoice.\\n\\n“If you mean that I was fond of her—yes, I was. You know, Emily was a\\nselfish old woman in her way. She was very generous, but she always\\nwanted a return. She never let people forget what she had done for\\nthem—and, that way she missed love. Don’t think she ever realized it,\\nthough, or felt the lack of it. Hope not, anyway. I was on a different\\nfooting. I took my stand from the first. ‘So many pounds a year I’m\\nworth to you. Well and good. But not a penny piece besides—not a pair\\nof gloves, nor a theatre ticket.’ She didn’t understand—was very\\noffended sometimes. Said I was foolishly proud. It wasn’t that—but I\\ncouldn’t explain. Anyway, I kept my self-respect. And so, out of the\\nwhole bunch, I was the only one who could allow myself to be fond of\\nher. I watched over her. I guarded her from the lot of them, and then a\\nglib-tongued scoundrel comes along, and pooh! all my years of devotion\\ngo for nothing.”\\n\\nPoirot nodded sympathetically.\\n\\n“I understand, mademoiselle, I understand all you feel. It is most\\nnatural. You think that we are lukewarm—that we lack fire and\\nenergy—but trust me, it is not so.”\\n\\nJohn stuck his head in at this juncture, and invited us both to come up\\nto Mrs. Inglethorp’s room, as he and Mr. Wells had finished looking\\nthrough the desk in the boudoir.\\n\\nAs we went up the stairs, John looked back to the dining-room door, and\\nlowered his voice confidentially:\\n\\n“Look here, what’s going to happen when these two meet?”\\n\\nI shook my head helplessly.\\n\\n“I’ve told Mary to keep them apart if she can.”\\n\\n“Will she be able to do so?”\\n\\n“The Lord only knows. There’s one thing, Inglethorp himself won’t be\\ntoo keen on meeting her.”\\n\\n“You’ve got the keys still, haven’t you, Poirot?” I asked, as we\\nreached the door of the locked room.\\n\\nTaking the keys from Poirot, John unlocked it, and we all passed in.\\nThe lawyer went straight to the desk, and John followed him.\\n\\n“My mother kept most of her important papers in this despatch-case, I\\nbelieve,” he said.\\n\\nPoirot drew out the small bunch of keys.\\n\\n“Permit me. I locked it, out of precaution, this morning.”\\n\\n“But it’s not locked now.”\\n\\n“Impossible!”\\n\\n“See.” And John lifted the lid as he spoke.\\n\\n“_Milles tonnerres!_” cried Poirot, dumbfounded. “And I—who have both\\nthe keys in my pocket!” He flung himself upon the case. Suddenly he\\nstiffened. “_Eh voilà une affaire!_ This lock has been forced.”\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\nPoirot laid down the case again.\\n\\n“But who forced it? Why should they? When? But the door was locked?”\\nThese exclamations burst from us disjointedly.\\n\\nPoirot answered them categorically—almost mechanically.\\n\\n“Who? That is the question. Why? Ah, if I only knew. When? Since I was\\nhere an hour ago. As to the door being locked, it is a very ordinary\\nlock. Probably any other of the doorkeys in this passage would fit it.”\\n\\nWe stared at one another blankly. Poirot had walked over to the\\nmantelpiece. He was outwardly calm, but I noticed his hands, which from\\nlong force of habit were mechanically straightening the spill vases on\\nthe mantelpiece, were shaking violently.\\n\\n“See here, it was like this,” he said at last. “There was something in\\nthat case—some piece of evidence, slight in itself perhaps, but still\\nenough of a clue to connect the murderer with the crime. It was vital\\nto him that it should be destroyed before it was discovered and its\\nsignificance appreciated. Therefore, he took the risk, the great risk,\\nof coming in here. Finding the case locked, he was obliged to force it,\\nthus betraying his presence. For him to take that risk, it must have\\nbeen something of great importance.”\\n\\n“But what was it?”\\n\\n“Ah!” cried Poirot, with a gesture of anger. “That, I do not know! A\\ndocument of some kind, without doubt, possibly the scrap of paper\\nDorcas saw in her hand yesterday afternoon. And I—” his anger burst\\nforth freely—“miserable animal that I am! I guessed nothing! I have\\nbehaved like an imbecile! I should never have left that case here. I\\nshould have carried it away with me. Ah, triple pig! And now it is\\ngone. It is destroyed—but is it destroyed? Is there not yet a chance—we\\nmust leave no stone unturned—”\\n\\nHe rushed like a madman from the room, and I followed him as soon as I\\nhad sufficiently recovered my wits. But, by the time I had reached the\\ntop of the stairs, he was out of sight.\\n\\nMary Cavendish was standing where the staircase branched, staring down\\ninto the hall in the direction in which he had disappeared.\\n\\n“What has happened to your extraordinary little friend, Mr. Hastings?\\nHe has just rushed past me like a mad bull.”\\n\\n“He’s rather upset about something,” I remarked feebly. I really did\\nnot know how much Poirot would wish me to disclose. As I saw a faint\\nsmile gather on Mrs. Cavendish’s expressive mouth, I endeavoured to try\\nand turn the conversation by saying: “They haven’t met yet, have they?”\\n\\n“Who?”\\n\\n“Mr. Inglethorp and Miss Howard.”\\n\\nShe looked at me in rather a disconcerting manner.\\n\\n“Do you think it would be such a disaster if they did meet?”\\n\\n“Well, don’t you?” I said, rather taken aback.\\n\\n“No.” She was smiling in her quiet way. “I should like to see a good\\nflare up. It would clear the air. At present we are all thinking so\\nmuch, and saying so little.”\\n\\n“John doesn’t think so,” I remarked. “He’s anxious to keep them apart.”\\n\\n“Oh, John!”\\n\\nSomething in her tone fired me, and I blurted out:\\n\\n“Old John’s an awfully good sort.”\\n\\nShe studied me curiously for a minute or two, and then said, to my\\ngreat surprise:\\n\\n“You are loyal to your friend. I like you for that.”\\n\\n“Aren’t you my friend too?”\\n\\n“I am a very bad friend.”\\n\\n“Why do you say that?”\\n\\n“Because it is true. I am charming to my friends one day, and forget\\nall about them the next.”\\n\\nI don’t know what impelled me, but I was nettled, and I said foolishly\\nand not in the best of taste:\\n\\n“Yet you seem to be invariably charming to Dr. Bauerstein!”\\n\\nInstantly I regretted my words. Her face stiffened. I had the\\nimpression of a steel curtain coming down and blotting out the real\\nwoman. Without a word, she turned and went swiftly up the stairs,\\nwhilst I stood like an idiot gaping after her.\\n\\nI was recalled to other matters by a frightful row going on below. I\\ncould hear Poirot shouting and expounding. I was vexed to think that my\\ndiplomacy had been in vain. The little man appeared to be taking the\\nwhole house into his confidence, a proceeding of which I, for one,\\ndoubted the wisdom. Once again I could not help regretting that my\\nfriend was so prone to lose his head in moments of excitement. I\\nstepped briskly down the stairs. The sight of me calmed Poirot almost\\nimmediately. I drew him aside.\\n\\n“My dear fellow,” I said, “is this wise? Surely you don’t want the\\nwhole house to know of this occurrence? You are actually playing into\\nthe criminal’s hands.”\\n\\n“You think so, Hastings?”\\n\\n“I am sure of it.”\\n\\n“Well, well, my friend, I will be guided by you.”\\n\\n“Good. Although, unfortunately, it is a little too late now.”\\n\\n“Sure.”\\n\\nHe looked so crestfallen and abashed that I felt quite sorry, though I\\nstill thought my rebuke a just and wise one.\\n\\n“Well,” he said at last, “let us go, _mon ami_.”\\n\\n“You have finished here?”\\n\\n“For the moment, yes. You will walk back with me to the village?”\\n\\n“Willingly.”\\n\\nHe picked up his little suit-case, and we went out through the open\\nwindow in the drawing-room. Cynthia Murdoch was just coming in, and\\nPoirot stood aside to let her pass.\\n\\n“Excuse me, mademoiselle, one minute.”\\n\\n“Yes?” she turned inquiringly.\\n\\n“Did you ever make up Mrs. Inglethorp’s medicines?”\\n\\nA slight flush rose in her face, as she answered rather constrainedly:\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“Only her powders?”\\n\\nThe flush deepened as Cynthia replied:\\n\\n“Oh, yes, I did make up some sleeping powders for her once.”\\n\\n“These?”\\n\\nPoirot produced the empty box which had contained powders.\\n\\nShe nodded.\\n\\n“Can you tell me what they were? Sulphonal? Veronal?”\\n\\n“No, they were bromide powders.”\\n\\n“Ah! Thank you, mademoiselle; good morning.”\\n\\nAs we walked briskly away from the house, I glanced at him more than\\nonce. I had often before noticed that, if anything excited him, his\\neyes turned green like a cat’s. They were shining like emeralds now.\\n\\n“My friend,” he broke out at last, “I have a little idea, a very\\nstrange, and probably utterly impossible idea. And yet—it fits in.”\\n\\nI shrugged my shoulders. I privately thought that Poirot was rather too\\nmuch given to these fantastic ideas. In this case, surely, the truth\\nwas only too plain and apparent.\\n\\n“So that is the explanation of the blank label on the box,” I remarked.\\n“Very simple, as you said. I really wonder that I did not think of it\\nmyself.”\\n\\nPoirot did not appear to be listening to me.\\n\\n“They have made one more discovery, _là-bas_,” he observed, jerking his\\nthumb over his shoulder in the direction of Styles. “Mr. Wells told me\\nas we were going upstairs.”\\n\\n“What was it?”\\n\\n“Locked up in the desk in the boudoir, they found a will of Mrs.\\nInglethorp’s, dated before her marriage, leaving her fortune to Alfred\\nInglethorp. It must have been made just at the time they were engaged.\\nIt came quite as a surprise to Wells—and to John Cavendish also. It was\\nwritten on one of those printed will forms, and witnessed by two of the\\nservants—not Dorcas.”\\n\\n“Did Mr. Inglethorp know of it?”\\n\\n“He says not.”\\n\\n“One might take that with a grain of salt,” I remarked sceptically.\\n“All these wills are very confusing. Tell me, how did those scribbled\\nwords on the envelope help you to discover that a will was made\\nyesterday afternoon?”\\n\\nPoirot smiled.\\n\\n“_Mon ami_, have you ever, when writing a letter, been arrested by the\\nfact that you did not know how to spell a certain word?”\\n\\n“Yes, often. I suppose everyone has.”\\n\\n“Exactly. And have you not, in such a case, tried the word once or\\ntwice on the edge of the blotting-paper, or a spare scrap of paper, to\\nsee if it looked right? Well, that is what Mrs. Inglethorp did. You\\nwill notice that the word ‘possessed’ is spelt first with one ‘s’ and\\nsubsequently with two—correctly. To make sure, she had further tried it\\nin a sentence, thus: ‘I am possessed.’ Now, what did that tell me? It\\ntold me that Mrs. Inglethorp had been writing the word ‘possessed’ that\\nafternoon, and, having the fragment of paper found in the grate fresh\\nin my mind, the possibility of a will—(a document almost certain to\\ncontain that word)—occurred to me at once. This possibility was\\nconfirmed by a further circumstance. In the general confusion, the\\nboudoir had not been swept that morning, and near the desk were several\\ntraces of brown mould and earth. The weather had been perfectly fine\\nfor some days, and no ordinary boots would have left such a heavy\\ndeposit.\\n\\n“I strolled to the window, and saw at once that the begonia beds had\\nbeen newly planted. The mould in the beds was exactly similar to that\\non the floor of the boudoir, and also I learnt from you that they _had_\\nbeen planted yesterday afternoon. I was now sure that one, or possibly\\nboth of the gardeners—for there were two sets of footprints in the\\nbed—had entered the boudoir, for if Mrs. Inglethorp had merely wished\\nto speak to them she would in all probability have stood at the window,\\nand they would not have come into the room at all. I was now quite\\nconvinced that she had made a fresh will, and had called the two\\ngardeners in to witness her signature. Events proved that I was right\\nin my supposition.”\\n\\n“That was very ingenious,” I could not help admitting. “I must confess\\nthat the conclusions I drew from those few scribbled words were quite\\nerroneous.”\\n\\nHe smiled.\\n\\n“You gave too much rein to your imagination. Imagination is a good\\nservant, and a bad master. The simplest explanation is always the most\\nlikely.”\\n\\n“Another point—how did you know that the key of the despatch-case had\\nbeen lost?”\\n\\n“I did not know it. It was a guess that turned out to be correct. You\\nobserved that it had a piece of twisted wire through the handle. That\\nsuggested to me at once that it had possibly been wrenched off a flimsy\\nkey-ring. Now, if it had been lost and recovered, Mrs. Inglethorp would\\nat once have replaced it on her bunch; but on her bunch I found what\\nwas obviously the duplicate key, very new and bright, which led me to\\nthe hypothesis that somebody else had inserted the original key in the\\nlock of the despatch-case.”\\n\\n“Yes,” I said, “Alfred Inglethorp, without doubt.”\\n\\nPoirot looked at me curiously.\\n\\n“You are very sure of his guilt?”\\n\\n“Well, naturally. Every fresh circumstance seems to establish it more\\nclearly.”\\n\\n“On the contrary,” said Poirot quietly, “there are several points in\\nhis favour.”\\n\\n“Oh, come now!”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“I see only one.”\\n\\n“And that?”\\n\\n“That he was not in the house last night.”\\n\\n“‘Bad shot!’ as you English say! You have chosen the one point that to\\nmy mind tells against him.”\\n\\n“How is that?”\\n\\n“Because if Mr. Inglethorp knew that his wife would be poisoned last\\nnight, he would certainly have arranged to be away from the house. His\\nexcuse was an obviously trumped up one. That leaves us two\\npossibilities: either he knew what was going to happen or he had a\\nreason of his own for his absence.”\\n\\n“And that reason?” I asked sceptically.\\n\\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n“How should I know? Discreditable, without doubt. This Mr. Inglethorp,\\nI should say, is somewhat of a scoundrel—but that does not of necessity\\nmake him a murderer.”\\n\\nI shook my head, unconvinced.\\n\\n“We do not agree, eh?” said Poirot. “Well, let us leave it. Time will\\nshow which of us is right. Now let us turn to other aspects of the\\ncase. What do you make of the fact that all the doors of the bedroom\\nwere bolted on the inside?”\\n\\n“Well——” I considered. “One must look at it logically.”\\n\\n“True.”\\n\\n“I should put it this way. The doors _were_ bolted—our own eyes have\\ntold us that—yet the presence of the candle grease on the floor, and\\nthe destruction of the will, prove that during the night someone\\nentered the room. You agree so far?”\\n\\n“Perfectly. Put with admirable clearness. Proceed.”\\n\\n“Well,” I said, encouraged, “as the person who entered did not do so by\\nthe window, nor by miraculous means, it follows that the door must have\\nbeen opened from inside by Mrs. Inglethorp herself. That strengthens\\nthe conviction that the person in question was her husband. She would\\nnaturally open the door to her own husband.”\\n\\nPoirot shook his head.\\n\\n“Why should she? She had bolted the door leading into his room—a most\\nunusual proceeding on her part—she had had a most violent quarrel with\\nhim that very afternoon. No, he was the last person she would admit.”\\n\\n“But you agree with me that the door must have been opened by Mrs.\\nInglethorp herself?”\\n\\n“There is another possibility. She may have forgotten to bolt the door\\ninto the passage when she went to bed, and have got up later, towards\\nmorning, and bolted it then.”\\n\\n“Poirot, is that seriously your opinion?”\\n\\n“No, I do not say it is so, but it might be. Now, to turn to another\\nfeature, what do you make of the scrap of conversation you overheard\\nbetween Mrs. Cavendish and her mother-in-law?”\\n\\n“I had forgotten that,” I said thoughtfully. “That is as enigmatical as\\never. It seems incredible that a woman like Mrs. Cavendish, proud and\\nreticent to the last degree, should interfere so violently in what was\\ncertainly not her affair.”\\n\\n“Precisely. It was an astonishing thing for a woman of her breeding to\\ndo.”\\n\\n“It is certainly curious,” I agreed. “Still, it is unimportant, and\\nneed not be taken into account.”\\n\\nA groan burst from Poirot.\\n\\n“What have I always told you? Everything must be taken into account. If\\nthe fact will not fit the theory—let the theory go.”\\n\\n“Well, we shall see,” I said, nettled.\\n\\n“Yes, we shall see.”\\n\\nWe had reached Leastways Cottage, and Poirot ushered me upstairs to his\\nown room. He offered me one of the tiny Russian cigarettes he himself\\noccasionally smoked. I was amused to notice that he stowed away the\\nused matches most carefully in a little china pot. My momentary\\nannoyance vanished.\\n\\nPoirot had placed our two chairs in front of the open window which\\ncommanded a view of the village street. The fresh air blew in warm and\\npleasant. It was going to be a hot day.\\n\\nSuddenly my attention was arrested by a weedy looking young man rushing\\ndown the street at a great pace. It was the expression on his face that\\nwas extraordinary—a curious mingling of terror and agitation.\\n\\n“Look, Poirot!” I said.\\n\\nHe leant forward.\\n\\n“_Tiens!_” he said. “It is Mr. Mace, from the chemist’s shop. He is\\ncoming here.”\\n\\nThe young man came to a halt before Leastways Cottage, and, after\\nhesitating a moment, pounded vigorously at the door.\\n\\n“A little minute,” cried Poirot from the window. “I come.”\\n\\nMotioning to me to follow him, he ran swiftly down the stairs and\\nopened the door. Mr. Mace began at once.\\n\\n“Oh, Mr. Poirot, I’m sorry for the inconvenience, but I heard that\\nyou’d just come back from the Hall?”\\n\\n“Yes, we have.”\\n\\nThe young man moistened his dry lips. His face was working curiously.\\n\\n“It’s all over the village about old Mrs. Inglethorp dying so suddenly.\\nThey do say—” he lowered his voice cautiously—“that it’s poison?”\\n\\nPoirot’s face remained quite impassive.\\n\\n“Only the doctors can tell us that, Mr. Mace.”\\n\\n“Yes, exactly—of course——” The young man hesitated, and then his\\nagitation was too much for him. He clutched Poirot by the arm, and sank\\nhis voice to a whisper: “Just tell me this, Mr. Poirot, it isn’t—it\\nisn’t strychnine, is it?”\\n\\nI hardly heard what Poirot replied. Something evidently of a\\nnon-committal nature. The young man departed, and as he closed the door\\nPoirot’s eyes met mine.\\n\\n“Yes,” he said, nodding gravely. “He will have evidence to give at the\\ninquest.”\\n\\nWe went slowly upstairs again. I was opening my lips, when Poirot\\nstopped me with a gesture of his hand.\\n\\n“Not now, not now, _mon ami_. I have need of reflection. My mind is in\\nsome disorder—which is not well.”\\n\\nFor about ten minutes he sat in dead silence, perfectly still, except\\nfor several expressive motions of his eyebrows, and all the time his\\neyes grew steadily greener. At last he heaved a deep sigh.\\n\\n“It is well. The bad moment has passed. Now all is arranged and\\nclassified. One must never permit confusion. The case is not clear\\nyet—no. For it is of the most complicated! It puzzles _me_. _Me_,\\nHercule Poirot! There are two facts of significance.”\\n\\n“And what are they?”\\n\\n“The first is the state of the weather yesterday. That is very\\nimportant.”\\n\\n“But it was a glorious day!” I interrupted. “Poirot, you’re pulling my\\nleg!”\\n\\n“Not at all. The thermometer registered 80 degrees in the shade. Do not\\nforget that, my friend. It is the key to the whole riddle!”\\n\\n“And the second point?” I asked.\\n\\n“The important fact that Monsieur Inglethorp wears very peculiar\\nclothes, has a black beard, and uses glasses.”\\n\\n“Poirot, I cannot believe you are serious.”\\n\\n“I am absolutely serious, my friend.”\\n\\n“But this is childish!”\\n\\n“No, it is very momentous.”\\n\\n“And supposing the Coroner’s jury returns a verdict of Wilful Murder\\nagainst Alfred Inglethorp. What becomes of your theories, then?”\\n\\n“They would not be shaken because twelve stupid men had happened to\\nmake a mistake! But that will not occur. For one thing, a country jury\\nis not anxious to take responsibility upon itself, and Mr. Inglethorp\\nstands practically in the position of local squire. Also,” he added\\nplacidly, “_I_ should not allow it!”\\n\\n“_You_ would not allow it?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\nI looked at the extraordinary little man, divided between annoyance and\\namusement. He was so tremendously sure of himself. As though he read my\\nthoughts, he nodded gently.\\n\\n“Oh, yes, _mon ami_, I would do what I say.” He got up and laid his\\nhand on my shoulder. His physiognomy underwent a complete change. Tears\\ncame into his eyes. “In all this, you see, I think of that poor Mrs.\\nInglethorp who is dead. She was not extravagantly loved—no. But she was\\nvery good to us Belgians—I owe her a debt.”\\n\\nI endeavoured to interrupt, but Poirot swept on.\\n\\n“Let me tell you this, Hastings. She would never forgive me if I let\\nAlfred Inglethorp, her husband, be arrested _now_—when a word from me\\ncould save him!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI.\\nTHE INQUEST\\n\\n\\nIn the interval before the inquest, Poirot was unfailing in his\\nactivity. Twice he was closeted with Mr. Wells. He also took long walks\\ninto the country. I rather resented his not taking me into his\\nconfidence, the more so as I could not in the least guess what he was\\ndriving at.\\n\\nIt occurred to me that he might have been making inquiries at Raikes’s\\nfarm; so, finding him out when I called at Leastways Cottage on\\nWednesday evening, I walked over there by the fields, hoping to meet\\nhim. But there was no sign of him, and I hesitated to go right up to\\nthe farm itself. As I walked away, I met an aged rustic, who leered at\\nme cunningly.\\n\\n“You’m from the Hall, bain’t you?” he asked.\\n\\n“Yes. I’m looking for a friend of mine whom I thought might have walked\\nthis way.”\\n\\n“A little chap? As waves his hands when he talks? One of them Belgies\\nfrom the village?”\\n\\n“Yes,” I said eagerly. “He has been here, then?”\\n\\n“Oh, ay, he’s been here, right enough. More’n once too. Friend of\\nyours, is he? Ah, you gentlemen from the Hall—you’m a pretty lot!” And\\nhe leered more jocosely than ever.\\n\\n“Why, do the gentlemen from the Hall come here often?” I asked, as\\ncarelessly as I could.\\n\\nHe winked at me knowingly.\\n\\n“_One_ does, mister. Naming no names, mind. And a very liberal\\ngentleman too! Oh, thank you, sir, I’m sure.”\\n\\nI walked on sharply. Evelyn Howard had been right then, and I\\nexperienced a sharp twinge of disgust, as I thought of Alfred\\nInglethorp’s liberality with another woman’s money. Had that piquant\\ngipsy face been at the bottom of the crime, or was it the baser\\nmainspring of money? Probably a judicious mixture of both.\\n\\nOn one point, Poirot seemed to have a curious obsession. He once or\\ntwice observed to me that he thought Dorcas must have made an error in\\nfixing the time of the quarrel. He suggested to her repeatedly that it\\nwas four-thirty, and not four o’clock when she had heard the voices.\\n\\nBut Dorcas was unshaken. Quite an hour, or even more, had elapsed\\nbetween the time when she had heard the voices and five o’clock, when\\nshe had taken tea to her mistress.\\n\\nThe inquest was held on Friday at the Stylites Arms in the village.\\nPoirot and I sat together, not being required to give evidence.\\n\\nThe preliminaries were gone through. The jury viewed the body, and John\\nCavendish gave evidence of identification.\\n\\nFurther questioned, he described his awakening in the early hours of\\nthe morning, and the circumstances of his mother’s death.\\n\\nThe medical evidence was next taken. There was a breathless hush, and\\nevery eye was fixed on the famous London specialist, who was known to\\nbe one of the greatest authorities of the day on the subject of\\ntoxicology.\\n\\nIn a few brief words, he summed up the result of the post-mortem. Shorn\\nof its medical phraseology and technicalities, it amounted to the fact\\nthat Mrs. Inglethorp had met her death as the result of strychnine\\npoisoning. Judging from the quantity recovered, she must have taken not\\nless than three-quarters of a grain of strychnine, but probably one\\ngrain or slightly over.\\n\\n“Is it possible that she could have swallowed the poison by accident?”\\nasked the Coroner.\\n\\n“I should consider it very unlikely. Strychnine is not used for\\ndomestic purposes, as some poisons are, and there are restrictions\\nplaced on its sale.”\\n\\n“Does anything in your examination lead you to determine how the poison\\nwas administered?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“You arrived at Styles before Dr. Wilkins, I believe?”\\n\\n“That is so. The motor met me just outside the lodge gates, and I\\nhurried there as fast as I could.”\\n\\n“Will you relate to us exactly what happened next?”\\n\\n“I entered Mrs. Inglethorp’s room. She was at that moment in a typical\\ntetanic convulsion. She turned towards me, and gasped out:\\n‘Alfred—Alfred——’”\\n\\n“Could the strychnine have been administered in Mrs. Inglethorp’s\\nafter-dinner coffee which was taken to her by her husband?”\\n\\n“Possibly, but strychnine is a fairly rapid drug in its action. The\\nsymptoms appear from one to two hours after it has been swallowed. It\\nis retarded under certain conditions, none of which, however, appear to\\nhave been present in this case. I presume Mrs. Inglethorp took the\\ncoffee after dinner about eight o’clock, whereas the symptoms did not\\nmanifest themselves until the early hours of the morning, which, on the\\nface of it, points to the drug having been taken much later in the\\nevening.”\\n\\n“Mrs. Inglethorp was in the habit of drinking a cup of cocoa in the\\nmiddle of the night. Could the strychnine have been administered in\\nthat?”\\n\\n“No, I myself took a sample of the cocoa remaining in the saucepan and\\nhad it analysed. There was no strychnine present.”\\n\\nI heard Poirot chuckle softly beside me.\\n\\n“How did you know?” I whispered.\\n\\n“Listen.”\\n\\n“I should say”—the doctor was continuing—“that I would have been\\nconsiderably surprised at any other result.”\\n\\n“Why?”\\n\\n“Simply because strychnine has an unusually bitter taste. It can be\\ndetected in a solution of one in seventy thousand, and can only be\\ndisguised by some strongly flavoured substance. Cocoa would be quite\\npowerless to mask it.”\\n\\nOne of the jury wanted to know if the same objection applied to coffee.\\n\\n“No. Coffee has a bitter taste of its own which would probably cover\\nthe taste of strychnine.”\\n\\n“Then you consider it more likely that the drug was administered in the\\ncoffee, but that for some unknown reason its action was delayed.”\\n\\n“Yes, but, the cup being completely smashed, there is no possibility of\\nanalyzing its contents.”\\n\\nThis concluded Dr. Bauerstein’s evidence. Dr. Wilkins corroborated it\\non all points. Sounded as to the possibility of suicide, he repudiated\\nit utterly. The deceased, he said, suffered from a weak heart, but\\notherwise enjoyed perfect health, and was of a cheerful and\\nwell-balanced disposition. She would be one of the last people to take\\nher own life.\\n\\nLawrence Cavendish was next called. His evidence was quite unimportant,\\nbeing a mere repetition of that of his brother. Just as he was about to\\nstep down, he paused, and said rather hesitatingly:\\n\\n“I should like to make a suggestion if I may?”\\n\\nHe glanced deprecatingly at the Coroner, who replied briskly:\\n\\n“Certainly, Mr. Cavendish, we are here to arrive at the truth of this\\nmatter, and welcome anything that may lead to further elucidation.”\\n\\n“It is just an idea of mine,” explained Lawrence. “Of course I may be\\nquite wrong, but it still seems to me that my mother’s death might be\\naccounted for by natural means.”\\n\\n“How do you make that out, Mr. Cavendish?”\\n\\n“My mother, at the time of her death, and for some time before it, was\\ntaking a tonic containing strychnine.”\\n\\n“Ah!” said the Coroner.\\n\\nThe jury looked up, interested.\\n\\n“I believe,” continued Lawrence, “that there have been cases where the\\ncumulative effect of a drug, administered for some time, has ended by\\ncausing death. Also, is it not possible that she may have taken an\\noverdose of her medicine by accident?”\\n\\n“This is the first we have heard of the deceased taking strychnine at\\nthe time of her death. We are much obliged to you, Mr. Cavendish.”\\n\\nDr. Wilkins was recalled and ridiculed the idea.\\n\\n“What Mr. Cavendish suggests is quite impossible. Any doctor would tell\\nyou the same. Strychnine is, in a certain sense, a cumulative poison,\\nbut it would be quite impossible for it to result in sudden death in\\nthis way. There would have to be a long period of chronic symptoms\\nwhich would at once have attracted my attention. The whole thing is\\nabsurd.”\\n\\n“And the second suggestion? That Mrs. Inglethorp may have inadvertently\\ntaken an overdose?”\\n\\n“Three, or even four doses, would not have resulted in death. Mrs.\\nInglethorp always had an extra large amount of medicine made up at a\\ntime, as she dealt with Coot’s, the Cash Chemists in Tadminster. She\\nwould have had to take very nearly the whole bottle to account for the\\namount of strychnine found at the post-mortem.”\\n\\n“Then you consider that we may dismiss the tonic as not being in any\\nway instrumental in causing her death?”\\n\\n“Certainly. The supposition is ridiculous.”\\n\\nThe same juryman who had interrupted before here suggested that the\\nchemist who made up the medicine might have committed an error.\\n\\n“That, of course, is always possible,” replied the doctor.\\n\\nBut Dorcas, who was the next witness called, dispelled even that\\npossibility. The medicine had not been newly made up. On the contrary,\\nMrs. Inglethorp had taken the last dose on the day of her death.\\n\\nSo the question of the tonic was finally abandoned, and the Coroner\\nproceeded with his task. Having elicited from Dorcas how she had been\\nawakened by the violent ringing of her mistress’s bell, and had\\nsubsequently roused the household, he passed to the subject of the\\nquarrel on the preceding afternoon.\\n\\nDorcas’s evidence on this point was substantially what Poirot and I had\\nalready heard, so I will not repeat it here.\\n\\nThe next witness was Mary Cavendish. She stood very upright, and spoke\\nin a low, clear, and perfectly composed voice. In answer to the\\nCoroner’s question, she told how, her alarm clock having aroused her at\\nfour-thirty as usual, she was dressing, when she was startled by the\\nsound of something heavy falling.\\n\\n“That would have been the table by the bed?” commented the Coroner.\\n\\n“I opened my door,” continued Mary, “and listened. In a few minutes a\\nbell rang violently. Dorcas came running down and woke my husband, and\\nwe all went to my mother-in-law’s room, but it was locked——”\\n\\nThe Coroner interrupted her.\\n\\n“I really do not think we need trouble you further on that point. We\\nknow all that can be known of the subsequent happenings. But I should\\nbe obliged if you would tell us all you overheard of the quarrel the\\nday before.”\\n\\n“I?”\\n\\nThere was a faint insolence in her voice. She raised her hand and\\nadjusted the ruffle of lace at her neck, turning her head a little as\\nshe did so. And quite spontaneously the thought flashed across my mind:\\n“She is gaining time!”\\n\\n“Yes. I understand,” continued the Coroner deliberately, “that you were\\nsitting reading on the bench just outside the long window of the\\nboudoir. That is so, is it not?”\\n\\nThis was news to me and glancing sideways at Poirot, I fancied that it\\nwas news to him as well.\\n\\nThere was the faintest pause, the mere hesitation of a moment, before\\nshe answered:\\n\\n“Yes, that is so.”\\n\\n“And the boudoir window was open, was it not?”\\n\\nSurely her face grew a little paler as she answered:\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“Then you cannot have failed to hear the voices inside, especially as\\nthey were raised in anger. In fact, they would be more audible where\\nyou were than in the hall.”\\n\\n“Possibly.”\\n\\n“Will you repeat to us what you overheard of the quarrel?”\\n\\n“I really do not remember hearing anything.”\\n\\n“Do you mean to say you did not hear voices?”\\n\\n“Oh, yes, I heard the voices, but I did not hear what they said.” A\\nfaint spot of colour came into her cheek. “I am not in the habit of\\nlistening to private conversations.”\\n\\nThe Coroner persisted.\\n\\n“And you remember nothing at all? _Nothing_, Mrs. Cavendish? Not one\\nstray word or phrase to make you realize that it _was_ a private\\nconversation?”\\n\\nShe paused, and seemed to reflect, still outwardly as calm as ever.\\n\\n“Yes; I remember. Mrs. Inglethorp said something—I do not remember\\nexactly what—about causing scandal between husband and wife.”\\n\\n“Ah!” the Coroner leant back satisfied. “That corresponds with what\\nDorcas heard. But excuse me, Mrs. Cavendish, although you realized it\\nwas a private conversation, you did not move away? You remained where\\nyou were?”\\n\\nI caught the momentary gleam of her tawny eyes as she raised them. I\\nfelt certain that at that moment she would willingly have torn the\\nlittle lawyer, with his insinuations, into pieces, but she replied\\nquietly enough:\\n\\n“No. I was very comfortable where I was. I fixed my mind on my book.”\\n\\n“And that is all you can tell us?”\\n\\n“That is all.”\\n\\nThe examination was over, though I doubted if the Coroner was entirely\\nsatisfied with it. I think he suspected that Mary Cavendish could tell\\nmore if she chose.\\n\\nAmy Hill, shop assistant, was next called, and deposed to having sold a\\nwill form on the afternoon of the 17th to William Earl, under-gardener\\nat Styles.\\n\\nWilliam Earl and Manning succeeded her, and testified to witnessing a\\ndocument. Manning fixed the time at about four-thirty, William was of\\nthe opinion that it was rather earlier.\\n\\nCynthia Murdoch came next. She had, however, little to tell. She had\\nknown nothing of the tragedy, until awakened by Mrs. Cavendish.\\n\\n“You did not hear the table fall?”\\n\\n“No. I was fast asleep.”\\n\\nThe Coroner smiled.\\n\\n“A good conscience makes a sound sleeper,” he observed. “Thank you,\\nMiss Murdoch, that is all.”\\n\\n“Miss Howard.”\\n\\nMiss Howard produced the letter written to her by Mrs. Inglethorp on\\nthe evening of the 17th. Poirot and I had, of course already seen it.\\nIt added nothing to our knowledge of the tragedy. The following is a\\nfacsimile:\\n\\nSTYLES COURT\\nESSEX\\nhand written note:\\n\\n     July 17th\\n     My dear Evelyn\\n     Can we not bury\\n     the hachet? I have\\n     found it hard to forgive\\n     the things you said\\n     against my dear husband\\n     but I am an old woman\\n     & very fond of you\\n     Yours affectionately,\\n    Emily Inglethorpe\\n\\n\\nIt was handed to the jury who scrutinized it attentively.\\n\\n“I fear it does not help us much,” said the Coroner, with a sigh.\\n“There is no mention of any of the events of that afternoon.”\\n\\n“Plain as a pikestaff to me,” said Miss Howard shortly. “It shows\\nclearly enough that my poor old friend had just found out she’d been\\nmade a fool of!”\\n\\n“It says nothing of the kind in the letter,” the Coroner pointed out.\\n\\n“No, because Emily never could bear to put herself in the wrong. But\\n_I_ know her. She wanted me back. But she wasn’t going to own that I’d\\nbeen right. She went round about. Most people do. Don’t believe in it\\nmyself.”\\n\\nMr. Wells smiled faintly. So, I noticed, did several of the jury. Miss\\nHoward was obviously quite a public character.\\n\\n“Anyway, all this tomfoolery is a great waste of time,” continued the\\nlady, glancing up and down the jury disparagingly. “Talk—talk—talk!\\nWhen all the time we know perfectly well——”\\n\\nThe Coroner interrupted her in an agony of apprehension:\\n\\n“Thank you, Miss Howard, that is all.”\\n\\nI fancy he breathed a sigh of relief when she complied.\\n\\nThen came the sensation of the day. The Coroner called Albert Mace,\\nchemist’s assistant.\\n\\nIt was our agitated young man of the pale face. In answer to the\\nCoroner’s questions, he explained that he was a qualified pharmacist,\\nbut had only recently come to this particular shop, as the assistant\\nformerly there had just been called up for the army.\\n\\nThese preliminaries completed, the Coroner proceeded to business.\\n\\n“Mr. Mace, have you lately sold strychnine to any unauthorized person?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir.”\\n\\n“When was this?”\\n\\n“Last Monday night.”\\n\\n“Monday? Not Tuesday?”\\n\\n“No, sir, Monday, the 16th.”\\n\\n“Will you tell us to whom you sold it?”\\n\\nYou could have heard a pin drop.\\n\\n“Yes, sir. It was to Mr. Inglethorp.”\\n\\nEvery eye turned simultaneously to where Alfred Inglethorp was sitting,\\nimpassive and wooden. He started slightly, as the damning words fell\\nfrom the young man’s lips. I half thought he was going to rise from his\\nchair, but he remained seated, although a remarkably well acted\\nexpression of astonishment rose on his face.\\n\\n“You are sure of what you say?” asked the Coroner sternly.\\n\\n“Quite sure, sir.”\\n\\n“Are you in the habit of selling strychnine indiscriminately over the\\ncounter?”\\n\\nThe wretched young man wilted visibly under the Coroner’s frown.\\n\\n“Oh, no, sir—of course not. But, seeing it was Mr. Inglethorp of the\\nHall, I thought there was no harm in it. He said it was to poison a\\ndog.”\\n\\nInwardly I sympathized. It was only human nature to endeavour to please\\n“The Hall”—especially when it might result in custom being transferred\\nfrom Coot’s to the local establishment.\\n\\n“Is it not customary for anyone purchasing poison to sign a book?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir, Mr. Inglethorp did so.”\\n\\n“Have you got the book here?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir.”\\n\\nIt was produced; and, with a few words of stern censure, the Coroner\\ndismissed the wretched Mr. Mace.\\n\\nThen, amidst a breathless silence, Alfred Inglethorp was called. Did he\\nrealize, I wondered, how closely the halter was being drawn around his\\nneck?\\n\\nThe Coroner went straight to the point.\\n\\n“On Monday evening last, did you purchase strychnine for the purpose of\\npoisoning a dog?”\\n\\nInglethorp replied with perfect calmness:\\n\\n“No, I did not. There is no dog at Styles, except an outdoor sheepdog,\\nwhich is in perfect health.”\\n\\n“You deny absolutely having purchased strychnine from Albert Mace on\\nMonday last?”\\n\\n“I do.”\\n\\n“Do you also deny _this_?”\\n\\nThe Coroner handed him the register in which his signature was\\ninscribed.\\n\\n“Certainly I do. The hand-writing is quite different from mine. I will\\nshow you.”\\n\\nHe took an old envelope out of his pocket, and wrote his name on it,\\nhanding it to the jury. It was certainly utterly dissimilar.\\n\\n“Then what is your explanation of Mr. Mace’s statement?”\\n\\nAlfred Inglethorp replied imperturbably:\\n\\n“Mr. Mace must have been mistaken.”\\n\\nThe Coroner hesitated for a moment, and then said:\\n\\n“Mr. Inglethorp, as a mere matter of form, would you mind telling us\\nwhere you were on the evening of Monday, July 16th?”\\n\\n“Really—I cannot remember.”\\n\\n“That is absurd, Mr. Inglethorp,” said the Coroner sharply. “Think\\nagain.”\\n\\nInglethorp shook his head.\\n\\n“I cannot tell you. I have an idea that I was out walking.”\\n\\n“In what direction?”\\n\\n“I really can’t remember.”\\n\\nThe Coroner’s face grew graver.\\n\\n“Were you in company with anyone?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“Did you meet anyone on your walk?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“That is a pity,” said the Coroner dryly. “I am to take it then that\\nyou decline to say where you were at the time that Mr. Mace positively\\nrecognized you as entering the shop to purchase strychnine?”\\n\\n“If you like to take it that way, yes.”\\n\\n“Be careful, Mr. Inglethorp.”\\n\\nPoirot was fidgeting nervously.\\n\\n“_Sacré!_” he murmured. “Does this imbecile of a man _want_ to be\\narrested?”\\n\\nInglethorp was indeed creating a bad impression. His futile denials\\nwould not have convinced a child. The Coroner, however, passed briskly\\nto the next point, and Poirot drew a deep breath of relief.\\n\\n“You had a discussion with your wife on Tuesday afternoon?”\\n\\n“Pardon me,” interrupted Alfred Inglethorp, “you have been misinformed.\\nI had no quarrel with my dear wife. The whole story is absolutely\\nuntrue. I was absent from the house the entire afternoon.”\\n\\n“Have you anyone who can testify to that?”\\n\\n“You have my word,” said Inglethorp haughtily.\\n\\nThe Coroner did not trouble to reply.\\n\\n“There are two witnesses who will swear to having heard your\\ndisagreement with Mrs. Inglethorp.”\\n\\n“Those witnesses were mistaken.”\\n\\nI was puzzled. The man spoke with such quiet assurance that I was\\nstaggered. I looked at Poirot. There was an expression of exultation on\\nhis face which I could not understand. Was he at last convinced of\\nAlfred Inglethorp’s guilt?\\n\\n“Mr. Inglethorp,” said the Coroner, “you have heard your wife’s dying\\nwords repeated here. Can you explain them in any way?”\\n\\n“Certainly I can.”\\n\\n“You can?”\\n\\n“It seems to me very simple. The room was dimly lighted. Dr. Bauerstein\\nis much of my height and build, and, like me, wears a beard. In the dim\\nlight, and suffering as she was, my poor wife mistook him for me.”\\n\\n“Ah!” murmured Poirot to himself. “But it is an idea, that!”\\n\\n“You think it is true?” I whispered.\\n\\n“I do not say that. But it is truly an ingenious supposition.”\\n\\n“You read my wife’s last words as an accusation”—Inglethorp was\\ncontinuing—“they were, on the contrary, an appeal to me.”\\n\\nThe Coroner reflected a moment, then he said:\\n\\n“I believe, Mr. Inglethorp, that you yourself poured out the coffee,\\nand took it to your wife that evening?”\\n\\n“I poured it out, yes. But I did not take it to her. I meant to do so,\\nbut I was told that a friend was at the hall door, so I laid down the\\ncoffee on the hall table. When I came through the hall again a few\\nminutes later, it was gone.”\\n\\nThis statement might, or might not, be true, but it did not seem to me\\nto improve matters much for Inglethorp. In any case, he had had ample\\ntime to introduce the poison.\\n\\nAt that point, Poirot nudged me gently, indicating two men who were\\nsitting together near the door. One was a little, sharp, dark,\\nferret-faced man, the other was tall and fair.\\n\\nI questioned Poirot mutely. He put his lips to my ear.\\n\\n“Do you know who that little man is?”\\n\\nI shook my head.\\n\\n“That is Detective Inspector James Japp of Scotland Yard—Jimmy Japp.\\nThe other man is from Scotland Yard too. Things are moving quickly, my\\nfriend.”\\n\\nI stared at the two men intently. There was certainly nothing of the\\npoliceman about them. I should never have suspected them of being\\nofficial personages.\\n\\nI was still staring, when I was startled and recalled by the verdict\\nbeing given:\\n\\n“Wilful Murder against some person or persons unknown.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII.\\nPOIROT PAYS HIS DEBTS\\n\\n\\nAs we came out of the Stylites Arms, Poirot drew me aside by a gentle\\npressure of the arm. I understood his object. He was waiting for the\\nScotland Yard men.\\n\\nIn a few moments, they emerged, and Poirot at once stepped forward, and\\naccosted the shorter of the two.\\n\\n“I fear you do not remember me, Inspector Japp.”\\n\\n“Why, if it isn’t Mr. Poirot!” cried the Inspector. He turned to the\\nother man. “You’ve heard me speak of Mr. Poirot? It was in 1904 he and\\nI worked together—the Abercrombie forgery case—you remember, he was run\\ndown in Brussels. Ah, those were great days, moosier. Then, do you\\nremember ‘Baron’ Altara? There was a pretty rogue for you! He eluded\\nthe clutches of half the police in Europe. But we nailed him in\\nAntwerp—thanks to Mr. Poirot here.”\\n\\nAs these friendly reminiscences were being indulged in, I drew nearer,\\nand was introduced to Detective-Inspector Japp, who, in his turn,\\nintroduced us both to his companion, Superintendent Summerhaye.\\n\\n“I need hardly ask what you are doing here, gentlemen,” remarked\\nPoirot.\\n\\nJapp closed one eye knowingly.\\n\\n“No, indeed. Pretty clear case I should say.”\\n\\nBut Poirot answered gravely:\\n\\n“There I differ from you.”\\n\\n“Oh, come!” said Summerhaye, opening his lips for the first time.\\n“Surely the whole thing is clear as daylight. The man’s caught\\nred-handed. How he could be such a fool beats me!”\\n\\nBut Japp was looking attentively at Poirot.\\n\\n“Hold your fire, Summerhaye,” he remarked jocularly. “Me and Moosier\\nhere have met before—and there’s no man’s judgment I’d sooner take than\\nhis. If I’m not greatly mistaken, he’s got something up his sleeve.\\nIsn’t that so, moosier?”\\n\\nPoirot smiled.\\n\\n“I have drawn certain conclusions—yes.”\\n\\nSummerhaye was still looking rather sceptical, but Japp continued his\\nscrutiny of Poirot.\\n\\n“It’s this way,” he said, “so far, we’ve only seen the case from the\\noutside. That’s where the Yard’s at a disadvantage in a case of this\\nkind, where the murder’s only out, so to speak, after the inquest. A\\nlot depends on being on the spot first thing, and that’s where Mr.\\nPoirot’s had the start of us. We shouldn’t have been here as soon as\\nthis even, if it hadn’t been for the fact that there was a smart doctor\\non the spot, who gave us the tip through the Coroner. But you’ve been\\non the spot from the first, and you may have picked up some little\\nhints. From the evidence at the inquest, Mr. Inglethorp murdered his\\nwife as sure as I stand here, and if anyone but you hinted the contrary\\nI’d laugh in his face. I must say I was surprised the jury didn’t bring\\nit in Wilful Murder against him right off. I think they would have, if\\nit hadn’t been for the Coroner—he seemed to be holding them back.”\\n\\n“Perhaps, though, you have a warrant for his arrest in your pocket\\nnow,” suggested Poirot.\\n\\nA kind of wooden shutter of officialdom came down from Japp’s\\nexpressive countenance.\\n\\n“Perhaps I have, and perhaps I haven’t,” he remarked dryly.\\n\\nPoirot looked at him thoughtfully.\\n\\n“I am very anxious, Messieurs, that he should not be arrested.”\\n\\n“I dare say,” observed Summerhaye sarcastically.\\n\\nJapp was regarding Poirot with comical perplexity.\\n\\n“Can’t you go a little further, Mr. Poirot? A wink’s as good as a\\nnod—from you. You’ve been on the spot—and the Yard doesn’t want to make\\nany mistakes, you know.”\\n\\nPoirot nodded gravely.\\n\\n“That is exactly what I thought. Well, I will tell you this. Use your\\nwarrant: Arrest Mr. Inglethorp. But it will bring you no kudos—the case\\nagainst him will be dismissed at once! _Comme ça!_” And he snapped his\\nfingers expressively.\\n\\nJapp’s face grew grave, though Summerhaye gave an incredulous snort.\\n\\nAs for me, I was literally dumb with astonishment. I could only\\nconclude that Poirot was mad.\\n\\nJapp had taken out a handkerchief, and was gently dabbing his brow.\\n\\n“I daren’t do it, Mr. Poirot. _I_’d take your word, but there’s others\\nover me who’ll be asking what the devil I mean by it. Can’t you give me\\na little more to go on?”\\n\\nPoirot reflected a moment.\\n\\n“It can be done,” he said at last. “I admit I do not wish it. It forces\\nmy hand. I would have preferred to work in the dark just for the\\npresent, but what you say is very just—the word of a Belgian policeman,\\nwhose day is past, is not enough! And Alfred Inglethorp must not be\\narrested. That I have sworn, as my friend Hastings here knows. See,\\nthen, my good Japp, you go at once to Styles?”\\n\\n“Well, in about half an hour. We’re seeing the Coroner and the doctor\\nfirst.”\\n\\n“Good. Call for me in passing—the last house in the village. I will go\\nwith you. At Styles, Mr. Inglethorp will give you, or if he refuses—as\\nis probable—I will give you such proofs that shall satisfy you that the\\ncase against him could not possibly be sustained. Is that a bargain?”\\n\\n“That’s a bargain,” said Japp heartily. “And, on behalf of the Yard,\\nI’m much obliged to you, though I’m bound to confess I can’t at present\\nsee the faintest possible loop-hole in the evidence, but you always\\nwere a marvel! So long, then, moosier.”\\n\\nThe two detectives strode away, Summerhaye with an incredulous grin on\\nhis face.\\n\\n“Well, my friend,” cried Poirot, before I could get in a word, “what do\\nyou think? _Mon Dieu!_ I had some warm moments in that court; I did not\\nfigure to myself that the man would be so pig-headed as to refuse to\\nsay anything at all. Decidedly, it was the policy of an imbecile.”\\n\\n“H’m! There are other explanations besides that of imbecility,” I\\nremarked. “For, if the case against him is true, how could he defend\\nhimself except by silence?”\\n\\n“Why, in a thousand ingenious ways,” cried Poirot. “See; say that it is\\nI who have committed this murder, I can think of seven most plausible\\nstories! Far more convincing than Mr. Inglethorp’s stony denials!”\\n\\nI could not help laughing.\\n\\n“My dear Poirot, I am sure you are capable of thinking of seventy! But,\\nseriously, in spite of what I heard you say to the detectives, you\\nsurely cannot still believe in the possibility of Alfred Inglethorp’s\\ninnocence?”\\n\\n“Why not now as much as before? Nothing has changed.”\\n\\n“But the evidence is so conclusive.”\\n\\n“Yes, too conclusive.”\\n\\nWe turned in at the gate of Leastways Cottage, and proceeded up the now\\nfamiliar stairs.\\n\\n“Yes, yes, too conclusive,” continued Poirot, almost to himself. “Real\\nevidence is usually vague and unsatisfactory. It has to be\\nexamined—sifted. But here the whole thing is cut and dried. No, my\\nfriend, this evidence has been very cleverly manufactured—so cleverly\\nthat it has defeated its own ends.”\\n\\n“How do you make that out?”\\n\\n“Because, so long as the evidence against him was vague and intangible,\\nit was very hard to disprove. But, in his anxiety, the criminal has\\ndrawn the net so closely that one cut will set Inglethorp free.”\\n\\nI was silent. And in a minute or two, Poirot continued:\\n\\n“Let us look at the matter like this. Here is a man, let us say, who\\nsets out to poison his wife. He has lived by his wits as the saying\\ngoes. Presumably, therefore, he has some wits. He is not altogether a\\nfool. Well, how does he set about it? He goes boldly to the village\\nchemist’s and purchases strychnine under his own name, with a trumped\\nup story about a dog which is bound to be proved absurd. He does not\\nemploy the poison that night. No, he waits until he has had a violent\\nquarrel with her, of which the whole household is cognisant, and which\\nnaturally directs their suspicions upon him. He prepares no defence—no\\nshadow of an alibi, yet he knows the chemist’s assistant must\\nnecessarily come forward with the facts. Bah! Do not ask me to believe\\nthat any man could be so idiotic! Only a lunatic, who wished to commit\\nsuicide by causing himself to be hanged, would act so!”\\n\\n“Still—I do not see——” I began.\\n\\n“Neither do I see. I tell you, _mon ami_, it puzzles me. _Me_—Hercule\\nPoirot!”\\n\\n“But if you believe him innocent, how do you explain his buying the\\nstrychnine?”\\n\\n“Very simply. He did _not_ buy it.”\\n\\n“But Mace recognized him!”\\n\\n“I beg your pardon, he saw a man with a black beard like Mr.\\nInglethorp’s, and wearing glasses like Mr. Inglethorp, and dressed in\\nMr. Inglethorp’s rather noticeable clothes. He could not recognize a\\nman whom he had probably only seen in the distance, since, you\\nremember, he himself had only been in the village a fortnight, and Mrs.\\nInglethorp dealt principally with Coot’s in Tadminster.”\\n\\n“Then you think——”\\n\\n“_Mon ami_, do you remember the two points I laid stress upon? Leave\\nthe first one for the moment, what was the second?”\\n\\n“The important fact that Alfred Inglethorp wears peculiar clothes, has\\na black beard, and uses glasses,” I quoted.\\n\\n“Exactly. Now suppose anyone wished to pass himself off as John or\\nLawrence Cavendish. Would it be easy?”\\n\\n“No,” I said thoughtfully. “Of course an actor——”\\n\\nBut Poirot cut me short ruthlessly.\\n\\n“And why would it not be easy? I will tell you, my friend: Because they\\nare both clean-shaven men. To make up successfully as one of these two\\nin broad daylight, it would need an actor of genius, and a certain\\ninitial facial resemblance. But in the case of Alfred Inglethorp, all\\nthat is changed. His clothes, his beard, the glasses which hide his\\neyes—those are the salient points about his personal appearance. Now,\\nwhat is the first instinct of the criminal? To divert suspicion from\\nhimself, is it not so? And how can he best do that? By throwing it on\\nsomeone else. In this instance, there was a man ready to his hand.\\nEverybody was predisposed to believe in Mr. Inglethorp’s guilt. It was\\na foregone conclusion that he would be suspected; but, to make it a\\nsure thing there must be tangible proof—such as the actual buying of\\nthe poison, and that, with a man of the peculiar appearance of Mr.\\nInglethorp, was not difficult. Remember, this young Mace had never\\nactually spoken to Mr. Inglethorp. How should he doubt that the man in\\nhis clothes, with his beard and his glasses, was not Alfred\\nInglethorp?”\\n\\n“It may be so,” I said, fascinated by Poirot’s eloquence. “But, if that\\nwas the case, why does he not say where he was at six o’clock on Monday\\nevening?”\\n\\n“Ah, why indeed?” said Poirot, calming down. “If he were arrested, he\\nprobably would speak, but I do not want it to come to that. I must make\\nhim see the gravity of his position. There is, of course, something\\ndiscreditable behind his silence. If he did not murder his wife, he is,\\nnevertheless, a scoundrel, and has something of his own to conceal,\\nquite apart from the murder.”\\n\\n“What can it be?” I mused, won over to Poirot’s views for the moment,\\nalthough still retaining a faint conviction that the obvious deduction\\nwas the correct one.\\n\\n“Can you not guess?” asked Poirot, smiling.\\n\\n“No, can you?”\\n\\n“Oh, yes, I had a little idea sometime ago—and it has turned out to be\\ncorrect.”\\n\\n“You never told me,” I said reproachfully.\\n\\nPoirot spread out his hands apologetically.\\n\\n“Pardon me, _mon ami_, you were not precisely _sympathique_.” He turned\\nto me earnestly. “Tell me—you see now that he must not be arrested?”\\n\\n“Perhaps,” I said doubtfully, for I was really quite indifferent to the\\nfate of Alfred Inglethorp, and thought that a good fright would do him\\nno harm.\\n\\nPoirot, who was watching me intently, gave a sigh.\\n\\n“Come, my friend,” he said, changing the subject, “apart from Mr.\\nInglethorp, how did the evidence at the inquest strike you?”\\n\\n“Oh, pretty much what I expected.”\\n\\n“Did nothing strike you as peculiar about it?”\\n\\nMy thoughts flew to Mary Cavendish, and I hedged:\\n\\n“In what way?”\\n\\n“Well, Mr. Lawrence Cavendish’s evidence for instance?”\\n\\nI was relieved.\\n\\n“Oh, Lawrence! No, I don’t think so. He’s always a nervous chap.”\\n\\n“His suggestion that his mother might have been poisoned accidentally\\nby means of the tonic she was taking, that did not strike you as\\nstrange— _hein?_”\\n\\n“No, I can’t say it did. The doctors ridiculed it of course. But it was\\nquite a natural suggestion for a layman to make.”\\n\\n“But Monsieur Lawrence is not a layman. You told me yourself that he\\nhad started by studying medicine, and that he had taken his degree.”\\n\\n“Yes, that’s true. I never thought of that.” I was rather startled. “It\\n_is_ odd.”\\n\\nPoirot nodded.\\n\\n“From the first, his behaviour has been peculiar. Of all the household,\\nhe alone would be likely to recognize the symptoms of strychnine\\npoisoning, and yet we find him the only member of the family to uphold\\nstrenuously the theory of death from natural causes. If it had been\\nMonsieur John, I could have understood it. He has no technical\\nknowledge, and is by nature unimaginative. But Monsieur Lawrence—no!\\nAnd now, to-day, he puts forward a suggestion that he himself must have\\nknown was ridiculous. There is food for thought in this, _mon ami!_”\\n\\n“It’s very confusing,” I agreed.\\n\\n“Then there is Mrs. Cavendish,” continued Poirot. “That’s another who\\nis not telling all she knows! What do you make of her attitude?”\\n\\n“I don’t know what to make of it. It seems inconceivable that she\\nshould be shielding Alfred Inglethorp. Yet that is what it looks like.”\\n\\nPoirot nodded reflectively.\\n\\n“Yes, it is queer. One thing is certain, she overheard a good deal more\\nof that ‘private conversation’ than she was willing to admit.”\\n\\n“And yet she is the last person one would accuse of stooping to\\neavesdrop!”\\n\\n“Exactly. One thing her evidence _has_ shown me. I made a mistake.\\nDorcas was quite right. The quarrel did take place earlier in the\\nafternoon, about four o’clock, as she said.”\\n\\nI looked at him curiously. I had never understood his insistence on\\nthat point.\\n\\n“Yes, a good deal that was peculiar came out to-day,” continued Poirot.\\n“Dr. Bauerstein, now, what was _he_ doing up and dressed at that hour\\nin the morning? It is astonishing to me that no one commented on the\\nfact.”\\n\\n“He has insomnia, I believe,” I said doubtfully.\\n\\n“Which is a very good, or a very bad explanation,” remarked Poirot. “It\\ncovers everything, and explains nothing. I shall keep my eye on our\\nclever Dr. Bauerstein.”\\n\\n“Any more faults to find with the evidence?” I inquired satirically.\\n\\n“_Mon ami_,” replied Poirot gravely, “when you find that people are not\\ntelling you the truth—look out! Now, unless I am much mistaken, at the\\ninquest to-day only one—at most, two persons were speaking the truth\\nwithout reservation or subterfuge.”\\n\\n“Oh, come now, Poirot! I won’t cite Lawrence, or Mrs. Cavendish. But\\nthere’s John—and Miss Howard, surely they were speaking the truth?”\\n\\n“Both of them, my friend? One, I grant you, but both——!”\\n\\nHis words gave me an unpleasant shock. Miss Howard’s evidence,\\nunimportant as it was, had been given in such a downright\\nstraightforward manner that it had never occurred to me to doubt her\\nsincerity. Still, I had a great respect for Poirot’s sagacity—except on\\nthe occasions when he was what I described to myself as “foolishly\\npig-headed.”\\n\\n“Do you really think so?” I asked. “Miss Howard had always seemed to me\\nso essentially honest—almost uncomfortably so.”\\n\\nPoirot gave me a curious look, which I could not quite fathom. He\\nseemed to speak, and then checked himself.\\n\\n“Miss Murdoch too,” I continued, “there’s nothing untruthful about\\n_her_.”\\n\\n“No. But it was strange that she never heard a sound, sleeping next\\ndoor; whereas Mrs. Cavendish, in the other wing of the building,\\ndistinctly heard the table fall.”\\n\\n“Well, she’s young. And she sleeps soundly.”\\n\\n“Ah, yes, indeed! She must be a famous sleeper, that one!”\\n\\nI did not quite like the tone of his voice, but at that moment a smart\\nknock reached our ears, and looking out of the window we perceived the\\ntwo detectives waiting for us below.\\n\\nPoirot seized his hat, gave a ferocious twist to his moustache, and,\\ncarefully brushing an imaginary speck of dust from his sleeve, motioned\\nme to precede him down the stairs; there we joined the detectives and\\nset out for Styles.\\n\\nI think the appearance of the two Scotland Yard men was rather a\\nshock—especially to John, though of course after the verdict, he had\\nrealized that it was only a matter of time. Still, the presence of the\\ndetectives brought the truth home to him more than anything else could\\nhave done.\\n\\nPoirot had conferred with Japp in a low tone on the way up, and it was\\nthe latter functionary who requested that the household, with the\\nexception of the servants, should be assembled together in the\\ndrawing-room. I realized the significance of this. It was up to Poirot\\nto make his boast good.\\n\\nPersonally, I was not sanguine. Poirot might have excellent reasons for\\nhis belief in Inglethorp’s innocence, but a man of the type of\\nSummerhaye would require tangible proofs, and these I doubted if Poirot\\ncould supply.\\n\\nBefore very long we had all trooped into the drawing-room, the door of\\nwhich Japp closed. Poirot politely set chairs for everyone. The\\nScotland Yard men were the cynosure of all eyes. I think that for the\\nfirst time we realized that the thing was not a bad dream, but a\\ntangible reality. We had read of such things—now we ourselves were\\nactors in the drama. To-morrow the daily papers, all over England,\\nwould blazon out the news in staring headlines:\\n\\n“MYSTERIOUS TRAGEDY IN ESSEX”\\n\\n    “WEALTHY LADY POISONED”\\n\\n\\nThere would be pictures of Styles, snap-shots of “The family leaving\\nthe Inquest”—the village photographer had not been idle! All the things\\nthat one had read a hundred times—things that happen to other people,\\nnot to oneself. And now, in this house, a murder had been committed. In\\nfront of us were “the detectives in charge of the case.” The well-known\\nglib phraseology passed rapidly through my mind in the interval before\\nPoirot opened the proceedings.\\n\\nI think everyone was a little surprised that it should be he and not\\none of the official detectives who took the initiative.\\n\\n“_Mesdames_ and _messieurs_,” said Poirot, bowing as though he were a\\ncelebrity about to deliver a lecture, “I have asked you to come here\\nall together, for a certain object. That object, it concerns Mr. Alfred\\nInglethorp.”\\n\\nInglethorp was sitting a little by himself—I think, unconsciously,\\neveryone had drawn his chair slightly away from him—and he gave a faint\\nstart as Poirot pronounced his name.\\n\\n“Mr. Inglethorp,” said Poirot, addressing him directly, “a very dark\\nshadow is resting on this house—the shadow of murder.”\\n\\nInglethorp shook his head sadly.\\n\\n“My poor wife,” he murmured. “Poor Emily! It is terrible.”\\n\\n“I do not think, monsieur,” said Poirot pointedly, “that you quite\\nrealize how terrible it may be—for you.” And as Inglethorp did not\\nappear to understand, he added: “Mr. Inglethorp, you are standing in\\nvery grave danger.”\\n\\nThe two detectives fidgeted. I saw the official caution “Anything you\\nsay will be used in evidence against you,” actually hovering on\\nSummerhaye’s lips. Poirot went on.\\n\\n“Do you understand now, monsieur?”\\n\\n“No. What do you mean?”\\n\\n“I mean,” said Poirot deliberately, “that you are suspected of\\npoisoning your wife.”\\n\\nA little gasp ran round the circle at this plain speaking.\\n\\n“Good heavens!” cried Inglethorp, starting up. “What a monstrous idea!\\n_I_—poison my dearest Emily!”\\n\\n“I do not think”—Poirot watched him narrowly—“that you quite realize\\nthe unfavourable nature of your evidence at the inquest. Mr.\\nInglethorp, knowing what I have now told you, do you still refuse to\\nsay where you were at six o’clock on Monday afternoon?”\\n\\nWith a groan, Alfred Inglethorp sank down again and buried his face in\\nhis hands. Poirot approached and stood over him.\\n\\n“Speak!” he cried menacingly.\\n\\nWith an effort, Inglethorp raised his face from his hands. Then, slowly\\nand deliberately, he shook his head.\\n\\n“You will not speak?”\\n\\n“No. I do not believe that anyone could be so monstrous as to accuse me\\nof what you say.”\\n\\nPoirot nodded thoughtfully, like a man whose mind is made up.\\n\\n“_Soit!_” he said. “Then I must speak for you.”\\n\\nAlfred Inglethorp sprang up again.\\n\\n“You? How can you speak? You do not know——” he broke off abruptly.\\n\\nPoirot turned to face us. “_Mesdames_ and _messieurs_! I speak! Listen!\\nI, Hercule Poirot, affirm that the man who entered the chemist’s shop,\\nand purchased strychnine at six o’clock on Monday last was not Mr.\\nInglethorp, for at six o’clock on that day Mr. Inglethorp was escorting\\nMrs. Raikes back to her home from a neighbouring farm. I can produce no\\nless than five witnesses to swear to having seen them together, either\\nat six or just after and, as you may know, the Abbey Farm, Mrs.\\nRaikes’s home, is at least two and a half miles distant from the\\nvillage. There is absolutely no question as to the alibi!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII.\\nFRESH SUSPICIONS\\n\\n\\nThere was a moment’s stupefied silence. Japp, who was the least\\nsurprised of any of us, was the first to speak.\\n\\n“My word,” he cried, “you’re the goods! And no mistake, Mr. Poirot!\\nThese witnesses of yours are all right, I suppose?”\\n\\n“_Voilà!_ I have prepared a list of them—names and addresses. You must\\nsee them, of course. But you will find it all right.”\\n\\n“I’m sure of that.” Japp lowered his voice. “I’m much obliged to you. A\\npretty mare’s nest arresting him would have been.” He turned to\\nInglethorp. “But, if you’ll excuse me, sir, why couldn’t you say all\\nthis at the inquest?”\\n\\n“I will tell you why,” interrupted Poirot. “There was a certain\\nrumour——”\\n\\n“A most malicious and utterly untrue one,” interrupted Alfred\\nInglethorp in an agitated voice.\\n\\n“And Mr. Inglethorp was anxious to have no scandal revived just at\\npresent. Am I right?”\\n\\n“Quite right.” Inglethorp nodded. “With my poor Emily not yet buried,\\ncan you wonder I was anxious that no more lying rumours should be\\nstarted.”\\n\\n“Between you and me, sir,” remarked Japp, “I’d sooner have any amount\\nof rumours than be arrested for murder. And I venture to think your\\npoor lady would have felt the same. And, if it hadn’t been for Mr.\\nPoirot here, arrested you would have been, as sure as eggs is eggs!”\\n\\n“I was foolish, no doubt,” murmured Inglethorp. “But you do not know,\\ninspector, how I have been persecuted and maligned.” And he shot a\\nbaleful glance at Evelyn Howard.\\n\\n“Now, sir,” said Japp, turning briskly to John, “I should like to see\\nthe lady’s bedroom, please, and after that I’ll have a little chat with\\nthe servants. Don’t you bother about anything. Mr. Poirot, here, will\\nshow me the way.”\\n\\nAs they all went out of the room, Poirot turned and made me a sign to\\nfollow him upstairs. There he caught me by the arm, and drew me aside.\\n\\n“Quick, go to the other wing. Stand there—just this side of the baize\\ndoor. Do not move till I come.” Then, turning rapidly, he rejoined the\\ntwo detectives.\\n\\nI followed his instructions, taking up my position by the baize door,\\nand wondering what on earth lay behind the request. Why was I to stand\\nin this particular spot on guard? I looked thoughtfully down the\\ncorridor in front of me. An idea struck me. With the exception of\\nCynthia Murdoch’s, everyone’s room was in this left wing. Had that\\nanything to do with it? Was I to report who came or went? I stood\\nfaithfully at my post. The minutes passed. Nobody came. Nothing\\nhappened.\\n\\nIt must have been quite twenty minutes before Poirot rejoined me.\\n\\n“You have not stirred?”\\n\\n“No, I’ve stuck here like a rock. Nothing’s happened.”\\n\\n“Ah!” Was he pleased, or disappointed? “You’ve seen nothing at all?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“But you have probably heard something? A big bump—eh, _mon ami?_”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“Is it possible? Ah, but I am vexed with myself! I am not usually\\nclumsy. I made but a slight gesture”—I know Poirot’s gestures—“with the\\nleft hand, and over went the table by the bed!”\\n\\nHe looked so childishly vexed and crest-fallen that I hastened to\\nconsole him.\\n\\n“Never mind, old chap. What does it matter? Your triumph downstairs\\nexcited you. I can tell you, that was a surprise to us all. There must\\nbe more in this affair of Inglethorp’s with Mrs. Raikes than we\\nthought, to make him hold his tongue so persistently. What are you\\ngoing to do now? Where are the Scotland Yard fellows?”\\n\\n“Gone down to interview the servants. I showed them all our exhibits. I\\nam disappointed in Japp. He has no method!”\\n\\n“Hullo!” I said, looking out of the window. “Here’s Dr. Bauerstein. I\\nbelieve you’re right about that man, Poirot. I don’t like him.”\\n\\n“He is clever,” observed Poirot meditatively.\\n\\n“Oh, clever as the devil! I must say I was overjoyed to see him in the\\nplight he was in on Tuesday. You never saw such a spectacle!” And I\\ndescribed the doctor’s adventure. “He looked a regular scarecrow!\\nPlastered with mud from head to foot.”\\n\\n“You saw him, then?”\\n\\n“Yes. Of course, he didn’t want to come in—it was just after dinner—but\\nMr. Inglethorp insisted.”\\n\\n“What?” Poirot caught me violently by the shoulders. “Was Dr.\\nBauerstein here on Tuesday evening? Here? And you never told me? Why\\ndid you not tell me? Why? Why?”\\n\\nHe appeared to be in an absolute frenzy.\\n\\n“My dear Poirot,” I expostulated, “I never thought it would interest\\nyou. I didn’t know it was of any importance.”\\n\\n“Importance? It is of the first importance! So Dr. Bauerstein was here\\non Tuesday night—the night of the murder. Hastings, do you not see?\\nThat alters everything—everything!”\\n\\nI had never seen him so upset. Loosening his hold of me, he\\nmechanically straightened a pair of candlesticks, still murmuring to\\nhimself: “Yes, that alters everything—everything.”\\n\\nSuddenly he seemed to come to a decision.\\n\\n“_Allons!_” he said. “We must act at once. Where is Mr. Cavendish?”\\n\\nJohn was in the smoking-room. Poirot went straight to him.\\n\\n“Mr. Cavendish, I have some important business in Tadminster. A new\\nclue. May I take your motor?”\\n\\n“Why, of course. Do you mean at once?”\\n\\n“If you please.”\\n\\nJohn rang the bell, and ordered round the car. In another ten minutes,\\nwe were racing down the park and along the high road to Tadminster.\\n\\n“Now, Poirot,” I remarked resignedly, “perhaps you will tell me what\\nall this is about?”\\n\\n“Well, _mon ami_, a good deal you can guess for yourself. Of course you\\nrealize that, now Mr. Inglethorp is out of it, the whole position is\\ngreatly changed. We are face to face with an entirely new problem. We\\nknow now that there is one person who did not buy the poison. We have\\ncleared away the manufactured clues. Now for the real ones. I have\\nascertained that anyone in the household, with the exception of Mrs.\\nCavendish, who was playing tennis with you, could have personated Mr.\\nInglethorp on Monday evening. In the same way, we have his statement\\nthat he put the coffee down in the hall. No one took much notice of\\nthat at the inquest—but now it has a very different significance. We\\nmust find out who did take that coffee to Mrs. Inglethorp eventually,\\nor who passed through the hall whilst it was standing there. From your\\naccount, there are only two people whom we can positively say did not\\ngo near the coffee—Mrs. Cavendish, and Mademoiselle Cynthia.”\\n\\n“Yes, that is so.” I felt an inexpressible lightening of the heart.\\nMary Cavendish could certainly not rest under suspicion.\\n\\n“In clearing Alfred Inglethorp,” continued Poirot, “I have been obliged\\nto show my hand sooner than I intended. As long as I might be thought\\nto be pursuing him, the criminal would be off his guard. Now, he will\\nbe doubly careful. Yes—doubly careful.” He turned to me abruptly. “Tell\\nme, Hastings, you yourself—have you no suspicions of anybody?”\\n\\nI hesitated. To tell the truth, an idea, wild and extravagant in\\nitself, had once or twice that morning flashed through my brain. I had\\nrejected it as absurd, nevertheless it persisted.\\n\\n“You couldn’t call it a suspicion,” I murmured. “It’s so utterly\\nfoolish.”\\n\\n“Come now,” urged Poirot encouragingly. “Do not fear. Speak your mind.\\nYou should always pay attention to your instincts.”\\n\\n“Well then,” I blurted out, “it’s absurd—but I suspect Miss Howard of\\nnot telling all she knows!”\\n\\n“Miss Howard?”\\n\\n“Yes—you’ll laugh at me——”\\n\\n“Not at all. Why should I?”\\n\\n“I can’t help feeling,” I continued blunderingly; “that we’ve rather\\nleft her out of the possible suspects, simply on the strength of her\\nhaving been away from the place. But, after all, she was only fifteen\\nmiles away. A car would do it in half an hour. Can we say positively\\nthat she was away from Styles on the night of the murder?”\\n\\n“Yes, my friend,” said Poirot unexpectedly, “we can. One of my first\\nactions was to ring up the hospital where she was working.”\\n\\n“Well?”\\n\\n“Well, I learnt that Miss Howard had been on afternoon duty on Tuesday,\\nand that—a convoy coming in unexpectedly—she had kindly offered to\\nremain on night duty, which offer was gratefully accepted. That\\ndisposes of that.”\\n\\n“Oh!” I said, rather nonplussed. “Really,” I continued, “it’s her\\nextraordinary vehemence against Inglethorp that started me off\\nsuspecting her. I can’t help feeling she’d do anything against him. And\\nI had an idea she might know something about the destroying of the\\nwill. She might have burnt the new one, mistaking it for the earlier\\none in his favour. She is so terribly bitter against him.”\\n\\n“You consider her vehemence unnatural?”\\n\\n“Y—es. She is so very violent. I wondered really whether she is quite\\nsane on that point.”\\n\\nPoirot shook his head energetically.\\n\\n“No, no, you are on a wrong tack there. There is nothing weak-minded or\\ndegenerate about Miss Howard. She is an excellent specimen of\\nwell-balanced English beef and brawn. She is sanity itself.”\\n\\n“Yet her hatred of Inglethorp seems almost a mania. My idea was—a very\\nridiculous one, no doubt—that she had intended to poison him—and that,\\nin some way, Mrs. Inglethorp got hold of it by mistake. But I don’t at\\nall see how it could have been done. The whole thing is absurd and\\nridiculous to the last degree.”\\n\\n“Still you are right in one thing. It is always wise to suspect\\neverybody until you can prove logically, and to your own satisfaction,\\nthat they are innocent. Now, what reasons are there against Miss\\nHoward’s having deliberately poisoned Mrs. Inglethorp?”\\n\\n“Why, she was devoted to her!” I exclaimed.\\n\\n“Tcha! Tcha!” cried Poirot irritably. “You argue like a child. If Miss\\nHoward were capable of poisoning the old lady, she would be quite\\nequally capable of simulating devotion. No, we must look elsewhere. You\\nare perfectly correct in your assumption that her vehemence against\\nAlfred Inglethorp is too violent to be natural; but you are quite wrong\\nin the deduction you draw from it. I have drawn my own deductions,\\nwhich I believe to be correct, but I will not speak of them at\\npresent.” He paused a minute, then went on. “Now, to my way of\\nthinking, there is one insuperable objection to Miss Howard’s being the\\nmurderess.”\\n\\n“And that is?”\\n\\n“That in no possible way could Mrs. Inglethorp’s death benefit Miss\\nHoward. Now there is no murder without a motive.”\\n\\nI reflected.\\n\\n“Could not Mrs. Inglethorp have made a will in her favour?”\\n\\nPoirot shook his head.\\n\\n“But you yourself suggested that possibility to Mr. Wells?”\\n\\nPoirot smiled.\\n\\n“That was for a reason. I did not want to mention the name of the\\nperson who was actually in my mind. Miss Howard occupied very much the\\nsame position, so I used her name instead.”\\n\\n“Still, Mrs. Inglethorp might have done so. Why, that will, made on the\\nafternoon of her death may——”\\n\\nBut Poirot’s shake of the head was so energetic that I stopped.\\n\\n“No, my friend. I have certain little ideas of my own about that will.\\nBut I can tell you this much—it was not in Miss Howard’s favour.”\\n\\nI accepted his assurance, though I did not really see how he could be\\nso positive about the matter.\\n\\n“Well,” I said, with a sigh, “we will acquit Miss Howard, then. It is\\npartly your fault that I ever came to suspect her. It was what you said\\nabout her evidence at the inquest that set me off.”\\n\\nPoirot looked puzzled.\\n\\n“What did I say about her evidence at the inquest?”\\n\\n“Don’t you remember? When I cited her and John Cavendish as being above\\nsuspicion?”\\n\\n“Oh—ah—yes.” He seemed a little confused, but recovered himself. “By\\nthe way, Hastings, there is something I want you to do for me.”\\n\\n“Certainly. What is it?”\\n\\n“Next time you happen to be alone with Lawrence Cavendish, I want you\\nto say this to him. ‘I have a message for you, from Poirot. He says:\\n“Find the extra coffee-cup, and you can rest in peace!”’ Nothing more.\\nNothing less.”\\n\\n“‘Find the extra coffee-cup, and you can rest in peace.’ Is that\\nright?” I asked, much mystified.\\n\\n“Excellent.”\\n\\n“But what does it mean?”\\n\\n“Ah, that I will leave you to find out. You have access to the facts.\\nJust say that to him, and see what he says.”\\n\\n“Very well—but it’s all extremely mysterious.”\\n\\nWe were running into Tadminster now, and Poirot directed the car to the\\n“Analytical Chemist.”\\n\\nPoirot hopped down briskly, and went inside. In a few minutes he was\\nback again.\\n\\n“There,” he said. “That is all my business.”\\n\\n“What were you doing there?” I asked, in lively curiosity.\\n\\n“I left something to be analysed.”\\n\\n“Yes, but what?”\\n\\n“The sample of cocoa I took from the saucepan in the bedroom.”\\n\\n“But that has already been tested!” I cried, stupefied. “Dr. Bauerstein\\nhad it tested, and you yourself laughed at the possibility of there\\nbeing strychnine in it.”\\n\\n“I know Dr. Bauerstein had it tested,” replied Poirot quietly.\\n\\n“Well, then?”\\n\\n“Well, I have a fancy for having it analysed again, that is all.”\\n\\nAnd not another word on the subject could I drag out of him.\\n\\nThis proceeding of Poirot’s, in respect of the cocoa, puzzled me\\nintensely. I could see neither rhyme nor reason in it. However, my\\nconfidence in him, which at one time had rather waned, was fully\\nrestored since his belief in Alfred Inglethorp’s innocence had been so\\ntriumphantly vindicated.\\n\\nThe funeral of Mrs. Inglethorp took place the following day, and on\\nMonday, as I came down to a late breakfast, John drew me aside, and\\ninformed me that Mr. Inglethorp was leaving that morning, to take up\\nhis quarters at the Stylites Arms until he should have completed his\\nplans.\\n\\n“And really it’s a great relief to think he’s going, Hastings,”\\ncontinued my honest friend. “It was bad enough before, when we thought\\nhe’d done it, but I’m hanged if it isn’t worse now, when we all feel\\nguilty for having been so down on the fellow. The fact is, we’ve\\ntreated him abominably. Of course, things did look black against him. I\\ndon’t see how anyone could blame us for jumping to the conclusions we\\ndid. Still, there it is, we were in the wrong, and now there’s a\\nbeastly feeling that one ought to make amends; which is difficult, when\\none doesn’t like the fellow a bit better than one did before. The whole\\nthing’s damned awkward! And I’m thankful he’s had the tact to take\\nhimself off. It’s a good thing Styles wasn’t the mater’s to leave to\\nhim. Couldn’t bear to think of the fellow lording it here. He’s welcome\\nto her money.”\\n\\n“You’ll be able to keep up the place all right?” I asked.\\n\\n“Oh, yes. There are the death duties, of course, but half my father’s\\nmoney goes with the place, and Lawrence will stay with us for the\\npresent, so there is his share as well. We shall be pinched at first,\\nof course, because, as I once told you, I am in a bit of a hole\\nfinancially myself. Still, the Johnnies will wait now.”\\n\\nIn the general relief at Inglethorp’s approaching departure, we had the\\nmost genial breakfast we had experienced since the tragedy. Cynthia,\\nwhose young spirits were naturally buoyant, was looking quite her\\npretty self again, and we all, with the exception of Lawrence, who\\nseemed unalterably gloomy and nervous, were quietly cheerful, at the\\nopening of a new and hopeful future.\\n\\nThe papers, of course, had been full of the tragedy. Glaring headlines,\\nsandwiched biographies of every member of the household, subtle\\ninnuendoes, the usual familiar tag about the police having a clue.\\nNothing was spared us. It was a slack time. The war was momentarily\\ninactive, and the newspapers seized with avidity on this crime in\\nfashionable life: “The Mysterious Affair at Styles” was the topic of\\nthe moment.\\n\\nNaturally it was very annoying for the Cavendishes. The house was\\nconstantly besieged by reporters, who were consistently denied\\nadmission, but who continued to haunt the village and the grounds,\\nwhere they lay in wait with cameras, for any unwary members of the\\nhousehold. We all lived in a blast of publicity. The Scotland Yard men\\ncame and went, examining, questioning, lynx-eyed and reserved of\\ntongue. Towards what end they were working, we did not know. Had they\\nany clue, or would the whole thing remain in the category of\\nundiscovered crimes?\\n\\nAfter breakfast, Dorcas came up to me rather mysteriously, and asked if\\nshe might have a few words with me.\\n\\n“Certainly. What is it, Dorcas?”\\n\\n“Well, it’s just this, sir. You’ll be seeing the Belgian gentleman\\nto-day perhaps?” I nodded. “Well, sir, you know how he asked me so\\nparticular if the mistress, or anyone else, had a green dress?”\\n\\n“Yes, yes. You have found one?” My interest was aroused.\\n\\n“No, not that, sir. But since then I’ve remembered what the young\\ngentlemen”—John and Lawrence were still the “young gentlemen” to\\nDorcas—“call the ‘dressing-up box.’ It’s up in the front attic, sir. A\\ngreat chest, full of old clothes and fancy dresses, and what not. And\\nit came to me sudden like that there might be a green dress amongst\\nthem. So, if you’d tell the Belgian gentleman——”\\n\\n“I will tell him, Dorcas,” I promised.\\n\\n“Thank you very much, sir. A very nice gentleman he is, sir. And quite\\na different class from them two detectives from London, what goes\\nprying about, and asking questions. I don’t hold with foreigners as a\\nrule, but from what the newspapers say I make out as how these brave\\nBelges isn’t the ordinary run of foreigners, and certainly he’s a most\\npolite spoken gentleman.”\\n\\nDear old Dorcas! As she stood there, with her honest face upturned to\\nmine, I thought what a fine specimen she was of the old-fashioned\\nservant that is so fast dying out.\\n\\nI thought I might as well go down to the village at once, and look up\\nPoirot; but I met him half-way, coming up to the house, and at once\\ngave him Dorcas’s message.\\n\\n“Ah, the brave Dorcas! We will look at the chest, although—but no\\nmatter—we will examine it all the same.”\\n\\nWe entered the house by one of the windows. There was no one in the\\nhall, and we went straight up to the attic.\\n\\nSure enough, there was the chest, a fine old piece, all studded with\\nbrass nails, and full to overflowing with every imaginable type of\\ngarment.\\n\\nPoirot bundled everything out on the floor with scant ceremony. There\\nwere one or two green fabrics of varying shades; but Poirot shook his\\nhead over them all. He seemed somewhat apathetic in the search, as\\nthough he expected no great results from it. Suddenly he gave an\\nexclamation.\\n\\n“What is it?”\\n\\n“Look!”\\n\\nThe chest was nearly empty, and there, reposing right at the bottom,\\nwas a magnificent black beard.\\n\\n“_Ohó!_” said Poirot. “_Ohó!_” He turned it over in his hands,\\nexamining it closely. “New,” he remarked. “Yes, quite new.”\\n\\nAfter a moment’s hesitation, he replaced it in the chest, heaped all\\nthe other things on top of it as before, and made his way briskly\\ndownstairs. He went straight to the pantry, where we found Dorcas\\nbusily polishing her silver.\\n\\nPoirot wished her good morning with Gallic politeness, and went on:\\n\\n“We have been looking through that chest, Dorcas. I am much obliged to\\nyou for mentioning it. There is, indeed, a fine collection there. Are\\nthey often used, may I ask?”\\n\\n“Well, sir, not very often nowadays, though from time to time we do\\nhave what the young gentlemen call ‘a dress-up night.’ And very funny\\nit is sometimes, sir. Mr. Lawrence, he’s wonderful. Most comic! I shall\\nnever forget the night he came down as the Char of Persia, I think he\\ncalled it—a sort of Eastern King it was. He had the big paper knife in\\nhis hand, and ‘Mind, Dorcas,’ he says, ‘you’ll have to be very\\nrespectful. This is my specially sharpened scimitar, and it’s off with\\nyour head if I’m at all displeased with you!’ Miss Cynthia, she was\\nwhat they call an Apache, or some such name—a Frenchified sort of\\ncut-throat, I take it to be. A real sight she looked. You’d never have\\nbelieved a pretty young lady like that could have made herself into\\nsuch a ruffian. Nobody would have known her.”\\n\\n“These evenings must have been great fun,” said Poirot genially. “I\\nsuppose Mr. Lawrence wore that fine black beard in the chest upstairs,\\nwhen he was Shah of Persia?”\\n\\n“He did have a beard, sir,” replied Dorcas, smiling. “And well I know\\nit, for he borrowed two skeins of my black wool to make it with! And\\nI’m sure it looked wonderfully natural at a distance. I didn’t know as\\nthere was a beard up there at all. It must have been got quite lately,\\nI think. There was a red wig, I know, but nothing else in the way of\\nhair. Burnt corks they use mostly—though ‘tis messy getting it off\\nagain. Miss Cynthia was a nigger once, and, oh, the trouble she had.”\\n\\n“So Dorcas knows nothing about that black beard,” said Poirot\\nthoughtfully, as we walked out into the hall again.\\n\\n“Do you think it is _the_ one?” I whispered eagerly.\\n\\nPoirot nodded.\\n\\n“I do. You notice it had been trimmed?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“Yes. It was cut exactly the shape of Mr. Inglethorp’s, and I found one\\nor two snipped hairs. Hastings, this affair is very deep.”\\n\\n“Who put it in the chest, I wonder?”\\n\\n“Someone with a good deal of intelligence,” remarked Poirot dryly. “You\\nrealize that he chose the one place in the house to hide it where its\\npresence would not be remarked? Yes, he is intelligent. But we must be\\nmore intelligent. We must be so intelligent that he does not suspect us\\nof being intelligent at all.”\\n\\nI acquiesced.\\n\\n“There, _mon ami_, you will be of great assistance to me.”\\n\\nI was pleased with the compliment. There had been times when I hardly\\nthought that Poirot appreciated me at my true worth.\\n\\n“Yes,” he continued, staring at me thoughtfully, “you will be\\ninvaluable.”\\n\\nThis was naturally gratifying, but Poirot’s next words were not so\\nwelcome.\\n\\n“I must have an ally in the house,” he observed reflectively.\\n\\n“You have me,” I protested.\\n\\n“True, but you are not sufficient.”\\n\\nI was hurt, and showed it. Poirot hurried to explain himself.\\n\\n“You do not quite take my meaning. You are known to be working with me.\\nI want somebody who is not associated with us in any way.”\\n\\n“Oh, I see. How about John?”\\n\\n“No, I think not.”\\n\\n“The dear fellow isn’t perhaps very bright,” I said thoughtfully.\\n\\n“Here comes Miss Howard,” said Poirot suddenly. “She is the very\\nperson. But I am in her black books, since I cleared Mr. Inglethorp.\\nStill, we can but try.”\\n\\nWith a nod that was barely civil, Miss Howard assented to Poirot’s\\nrequest for a few minutes’ conversation.\\n\\nWe went into the little morning-room, and Poirot closed the door.\\n\\n“Well, Monsieur Poirot,” said Miss Howard impatiently, “what is it? Out\\nwith it. I’m busy.”\\n\\n“Do you remember, mademoiselle, that I once asked you to help me?”\\n\\n“Yes, I do.” The lady nodded. “And I told you I’d help you with\\npleasure—to hang Alfred Inglethorp.”\\n\\n“Ah!” Poirot studied her seriously. “Miss Howard, I will ask you one\\nquestion. I beg of you to reply to it truthfully.”\\n\\n“Never tell lies,” replied Miss Howard.\\n\\n“It is this. Do you still believe that Mrs. Inglethorp was poisoned by\\nher husband?”\\n\\n“What do you mean?” she asked sharply. “You needn’t think your pretty\\nexplanations influence me in the slightest. I’ll admit that it wasn’t\\nhe who bought strychnine at the chemist’s shop. What of that? I dare\\nsay he soaked fly paper, as I told you at the beginning.”\\n\\n“That is arsenic—not strychnine,” said Poirot mildly.\\n\\n“What does that matter? Arsenic would put poor Emily out of the way\\njust as well as strychnine. If I’m convinced he did it, it doesn’t\\nmatter a jot to me _how_ he did it.”\\n\\n“Exactly. _If_ you are convinced he did it,” said Poirot quietly. “I\\nwill put my question in another form. Did you ever in your heart of\\nhearts believe that Mrs. Inglethorp was poisoned by her husband?”\\n\\n“Good heavens!” cried Miss Howard. “Haven’t I always told you the man\\nis a villain? Haven’t I always told you he would murder her in her bed?\\nHaven’t I always hated him like poison?”\\n\\n“Exactly,” said Poirot. “That bears out my little idea entirely.”\\n\\n“What little idea?”\\n\\n“Miss Howard, do you remember a conversation that took place on the day\\nof my friend’s arrival here? He repeated it to me, and there is a\\nsentence of yours that has impressed me very much. Do you remember\\naffirming that if a crime had been committed, and anyone you loved had\\nbeen murdered, you felt certain that you would know by instinct who the\\ncriminal was, even if you were quite unable to prove it?”\\n\\n“Yes, I remember saying that. I believe it too. I suppose you think it\\nnonsense?”\\n\\n“Not at all.”\\n\\n“And yet you will pay no attention to my instinct against Alfred\\nInglethorp.”\\n\\n“No,” said Poirot curtly. “Because your instinct is not against Mr.\\nInglethorp.”\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“No. You wish to believe he committed the crime. You believe him\\ncapable of committing it. But your instinct tells you he did not commit\\nit. It tells you more—shall I go on?”\\n\\nShe was staring at him, fascinated, and made a slight affirmative\\nmovement of the hand.\\n\\n“Shall I tell you why you have been so vehement against Mr. Inglethorp?\\nIt is because you have been trying to believe what you wish to believe.\\nIt is because you are trying to drown and stifle your instinct, which\\ntells you another name——”\\n\\n“No, no, no!” cried Miss Howard wildly, flinging up her hands. “Don’t\\nsay it! Oh, don’t say it! It isn’t true! It can’t be true. I don’t know\\nwhat put such a wild—such a dreadful—idea into my head!”\\n\\n“I am right, am I not?” asked Poirot.\\n\\n“Yes, yes; you must be a wizard to have guessed. But it can’t be\\nso—it’s too monstrous, too impossible. It _must_ be Alfred Inglethorp.”\\n\\nPoirot shook his head gravely.\\n\\n“Don’t ask me about it,” continued Miss Howard, “because I shan’t tell\\nyou. I won’t admit it, even to myself. I must be mad to think of such a\\nthing.”\\n\\nPoirot nodded, as if satisfied.\\n\\n“I will ask you nothing. It is enough for me that it is as I thought.\\nAnd I—I, too, have an instinct. We are working together towards a\\ncommon end.”\\n\\n“Don’t ask me to help you, because I won’t. I wouldn’t lift a finger\\nto—to——” She faltered.\\n\\n“You will help me in spite of yourself. I ask you nothing—but you will\\nbe my ally. You will not be able to help yourself. You will do the only\\nthing that I want of you.”\\n\\n“And that is?”\\n\\n“You will watch!”\\n\\nEvelyn Howard bowed her head.\\n\\n“Yes, I can’t help doing that. I am always watching—always hoping I\\nshall be proved wrong.”\\n\\n“If we are wrong, well and good,” said Poirot. “No one will be more\\npleased than I shall. But, if we are right? If we are right, Miss\\nHoward, on whose side are you then?”\\n\\n“I don’t know, I don’t know——”\\n\\n“Come now.”\\n\\n“It could be hushed up.”\\n\\n“There must be no hushing up.”\\n\\n“But Emily herself——” She broke off.\\n\\n“Miss Howard,” said Poirot gravely, “this is unworthy of you.”\\n\\nSuddenly she took her face from her hands.\\n\\n“Yes,” she said quietly, “that was not Evelyn Howard who spoke!” She\\nflung her head up proudly. “_This_ is Evelyn Howard! And she is on the\\nside of Justice! Let the cost be what it may.” And with these words,\\nshe walked firmly out of the room.\\n\\n“There,” said Poirot, looking after her, “goes a very valuable ally.\\nThat woman, Hastings, has got brains as well as a heart.”\\n\\nI did not reply.\\n\\n“Instinct is a marvellous thing,” mused Poirot. “It can neither be\\nexplained nor ignored.”\\n\\n“You and Miss Howard seem to know what you are talking about,” I\\nobserved coldly. “Perhaps you don’t realize that _I_ am still in the\\ndark.”\\n\\n“Really? Is that so, _mon ami?_”\\n\\n“Yes. Enlighten me, will you?”\\n\\nPoirot studied me attentively for a moment or two. Then, to my intense\\nsurprise, he shook his head decidedly.\\n\\n“No, my friend.”\\n\\n“Oh, look here, why not?”\\n\\n“Two is enough for a secret.”\\n\\n“Well, I think it is very unfair to keep back facts from me.”\\n\\n“I am not keeping back facts. Every fact that I know is in your\\npossession. You can draw your own deductions from them. This time it is\\na question of ideas.”\\n\\n“Still, it would be interesting to know.”\\n\\nPoirot looked at me very earnestly, and again shook his head.\\n\\n“You see,” he said sadly, “_you_ have no instincts.”\\n\\n“It was intelligence you were requiring just now,” I pointed out.\\n\\n“The two often go together,” said Poirot enigmatically.\\n\\nThe remark seemed so utterly irrelevant that I did not even take the\\ntrouble to answer it. But I decided that if I made any interesting and\\nimportant discoveries—as no doubt I should—I would keep them to myself,\\nand surprise Poirot with the ultimate result.\\n\\nThere are times when it is one’s duty to assert oneself.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX.\\nDR. BAUERSTEIN\\n\\n\\nI had had no opportunity as yet of passing on Poirot’s message to\\nLawrence. But now, as I strolled out on the lawn, still nursing a\\ngrudge against my friend’s high-handedness, I saw Lawrence on the\\ncroquet lawn, aimlessly knocking a couple of very ancient balls about,\\nwith a still more ancient mallet.\\n\\nIt struck me that it would be a good opportunity to deliver my message.\\nOtherwise, Poirot himself might relieve me of it. It was true that I\\ndid not quite gather its purport, but I flattered myself that by\\nLawrence’s reply, and perhaps a little skillful cross-examination on my\\npart, I should soon perceive its significance. Accordingly I accosted\\nhim.\\n\\n“I’ve been looking for you,” I remarked untruthfully.\\n\\n“Have you?”\\n\\n“Yes. The truth is, I’ve got a message for you—from Poirot.”\\n\\n“Yes?”\\n\\n“He told me to wait until I was alone with you,” I said, dropping my\\nvoice significantly, and watching him intently out of the corner of my\\neye. I have always been rather good at what is called, I believe,\\ncreating an atmosphere.\\n\\n“Well?”\\n\\nThere was no change of expression in the dark melancholic face. Had he\\nany idea of what I was about to say?\\n\\n“This is the message.” I dropped my voice still lower. “‘Find the extra\\ncoffee-cup, and you can rest in peace.’”\\n\\n“What on earth does he mean?” Lawrence stared at me in quite unaffected\\nastonishment.\\n\\n“Don’t you know?”\\n\\n“Not in the least. Do you?”\\n\\nI was compelled to shake my head.\\n\\n“What extra coffee-cup?”\\n\\n“I don’t know.”\\n\\n“He’d better ask Dorcas, or one of the maids, if he wants to know about\\ncoffee-cups. It’s their business, not mine. I don’t know anything about\\nthe coffee-cups, except that we’ve got some that are never used, which\\nare a perfect dream! Old Worcester. You’re not a connoisseur, are you,\\nHastings?”\\n\\nI shook my head.\\n\\n“You miss a lot. A really perfect bit of old china—it’s pure delight to\\nhandle it, or even to look at it.”\\n\\n“Well, what am I to tell Poirot?”\\n\\n“Tell him I don’t know what he’s talking about. It’s double Dutch to\\nme.”\\n\\n“All right.”\\n\\nI was moving off towards the house again when he suddenly called me\\nback.\\n\\n“I say, what was the end of that message? Say it over again, will you?”\\n\\n“‘Find the extra coffee-cup, and you can rest in peace.’ Are you sure\\nyou don’t know what it means?” I asked him earnestly.\\n\\nHe shook his head.\\n\\n“No,” he said musingly, “I don’t. I—I wish I did.”\\n\\nThe boom of the gong sounded from the house, and we went in together.\\nPoirot had been asked by John to remain to lunch, and was already\\nseated at the table.\\n\\nBy tacit consent, all mention of the tragedy was barred. We conversed\\non the war, and other outside topics. But after the cheese and biscuits\\nhad been handed round, and Dorcas had left the room, Poirot suddenly\\nleant forward to Mrs. Cavendish.\\n\\n“Pardon me, madame, for recalling unpleasant memories, but I have a\\nlittle idea”—Poirot’s “little ideas” were becoming a perfect\\nbyword—“and would like to ask one or two questions.”\\n\\n“Of me? Certainly.”\\n\\n“You are too amiable, madame. What I want to ask is this: the door\\nleading into Mrs. Inglethorp’s room from that of Mademoiselle Cynthia,\\nit was bolted, you say?”\\n\\n“Certainly it was bolted,” replied Mary Cavendish, rather surprised. “I\\nsaid so at the inquest.”\\n\\n“Bolted?”\\n\\n“Yes.” She looked perplexed.\\n\\n“I mean,” explained Poirot, “you are sure it was bolted, and not merely\\nlocked?”\\n\\n“Oh, I see what you mean. No, I don’t know. I said bolted, meaning that\\nit was fastened, and I could not open it, but I believe all the doors\\nwere found bolted on the inside.”\\n\\n“Still, as far as you are concerned, the door might equally well have\\nbeen locked?”\\n\\n“Oh, yes.”\\n\\n“You yourself did not happen to notice, madame, when you entered Mrs.\\nInglethorp’s room, whether that door was bolted or not?”\\n\\n“I—I believe it was.”\\n\\n“But you did not see it?”\\n\\n“No. I—never looked.”\\n\\n“But _I_ did,” interrupted Lawrence suddenly. “I happened to notice\\nthat it _was_ bolted.”\\n\\n“Ah, that settles it.” And Poirot looked crestfallen.\\n\\nI could not help rejoicing that, for once, one of his “little ideas”\\nhad come to naught.\\n\\nAfter lunch Poirot begged me to accompany him home. I consented rather\\nstiffly.\\n\\n“You are annoyed, is it not so?” he asked anxiously, as we walked\\nthrough the park.\\n\\n“Not at all,” I said coldly.\\n\\n“That is well. That lifts a great load from my mind.”\\n\\nThis was not quite what I had intended. I had hoped that he would have\\nobserved the stiffness of my manner. Still, the fervour of his words\\nwent towards the appeasing of my just displeasure. I thawed.\\n\\n“I gave Lawrence your message,” I said.\\n\\n“And what did he say? He was entirely puzzled?”\\n\\n“Yes. I am quite sure he had no idea of what you meant.”\\n\\nI had expected Poirot to be disappointed; but, to my surprise, he\\nreplied that that was as he had thought, and that he was very glad. My\\npride forbade me to ask any questions.\\n\\nPoirot switched off on another tack.\\n\\n“Mademoiselle Cynthia was not at lunch to-day? How was that?”\\n\\n“She is at the hospital again. She resumed work to-day.”\\n\\n“Ah, she is an industrious little demoiselle. And pretty too. She is\\nlike pictures I have seen in Italy. I would rather like to see that\\ndispensary of hers. Do you think she would show it to me?”\\n\\n“I am sure she would be delighted. It’s an interesting little place.”\\n\\n“Does she go there every day?”\\n\\n“She has all Wednesdays off, and comes back to lunch on Saturdays.\\nThose are her only times off.”\\n\\n“I will remember. Women are doing great work nowadays, and Mademoiselle\\nCynthia is clever—oh, yes, she has brains, that little one.”\\n\\n“Yes. I believe she has passed quite a stiff exam.”\\n\\n“Without doubt. After all, it is very responsible work. I suppose they\\nhave very strong poisons there?”\\n\\n“Yes, she showed them to us. They are kept locked up in a little\\ncupboard. I believe they have to be very careful. They always take out\\nthe key before leaving the room.”\\n\\n“Indeed. It is near the window, this cupboard?”\\n\\n“No, right the other side of the room. Why?”\\n\\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n“I wondered. That is all. Will you come in?”\\n\\nWe had reached the cottage.\\n\\n“No. I think I’ll be getting back. I shall go round the long way\\nthrough the woods.”\\n\\nThe woods round Styles were very beautiful. After the walk across the\\nopen park, it was pleasant to saunter lazily through the cool glades.\\nThere was hardly a breath of wind, the very chirp of the birds was\\nfaint and subdued. I strolled on a little way, and finally flung myself\\ndown at the foot of a grand old beech-tree. My thoughts of mankind were\\nkindly and charitable. I even forgave Poirot for his absurd secrecy. In\\nfact, I was at peace with the world. Then I yawned.\\n\\nI thought about the crime, and it struck me as being very unreal and\\nfar off.\\n\\nI yawned again.\\n\\nProbably, I thought, it really never happened. Of course, it was all a\\nbad dream. The truth of the matter was that it was Lawrence who had\\nmurdered Alfred Inglethorp with a croquet mallet. But it was absurd of\\nJohn to make such a fuss about it, and to go shouting out: “I tell you\\nI won’t have it!”\\n\\nI woke up with a start.\\n\\nAt once I realized that I was in a very awkward predicament. For, about\\ntwelve feet away from me, John and Mary Cavendish were standing facing\\neach other, and they were evidently quarrelling. And, quite as\\nevidently, they were unaware of my vicinity, for before I could move or\\nspeak John repeated the words which had aroused me from my dream.\\n\\n“I tell you, Mary, I won’t have it.”\\n\\nMary’s voice came, cool and liquid:\\n\\n“Have _you_ any right to criticize my actions?”\\n\\n“It will be the talk of the village! My mother was only buried on\\nSaturday, and here you are gadding about with the fellow.”\\n\\n“Oh,” she shrugged her shoulders, “if it is only village gossip that\\nyou mind!”\\n\\n“But it isn’t. I’ve had enough of the fellow hanging about. He’s a\\nPolish Jew, anyway.”\\n\\n“A tinge of Jewish blood is not a bad thing. It leavens the”—she looked\\nat him—“stolid stupidity of the ordinary Englishman.”\\n\\nFire in her eyes, ice in her voice. I did not wonder that the blood\\nrose to John’s face in a crimson tide.\\n\\n“Mary!”\\n\\n“Well?” Her tone did not change.\\n\\nThe pleading died out of his voice.\\n\\n“Am I to understand that you will continue to see Bauerstein against my\\nexpress wishes?”\\n\\n“If I choose.”\\n\\n“You defy me?”\\n\\n“No, but I deny your right to criticize my actions. Have _you_ no\\nfriends of whom I should disapprove?”\\n\\nJohn fell back a pace. The colour ebbed slowly from his face.\\n\\n“What do you mean?” he said, in an unsteady voice.\\n\\n“You see!” said Mary quietly. “You _do_ see, don’t you, that _you_ have\\nno right to dictate to _me_ as to the choice of my friends?”\\n\\nJohn glanced at her pleadingly, a stricken look on his face.\\n\\n“No right? Have I _no_ right, Mary?” he said unsteadily. He stretched\\nout his hands. “Mary——”\\n\\nFor a moment, I thought she wavered. A softer expression came over her\\nface, then suddenly she turned almost fiercely away.\\n\\n“None!”\\n\\nShe was walking away when John sprang after her, and caught her by the\\narm.\\n\\n“Mary”—his voice was very quiet now—“are you in love with this fellow\\nBauerstein?”\\n\\nShe hesitated, and suddenly there swept across her face a strange\\nexpression, old as the hills, yet with something eternally young about\\nit. So might some Egyptian sphinx have smiled.\\n\\nShe freed herself quietly from his arm, and spoke over her shoulder.\\n\\n“Perhaps,” she said; and then swiftly passed out of the little glade,\\nleaving John standing there as though he had been turned to stone.\\n\\nRather ostentatiously, I stepped forward, crackling some dead branches\\nwith my feet as I did so. John turned. Luckily, he took it for granted\\nthat I had only just come upon the scene.\\n\\n“Hullo, Hastings. Have you seen the little fellow safely back to his\\ncottage? Quaint little chap! Is he any good, though, really?”\\n\\n“He was considered one of the finest detectives of his day.”\\n\\n“Oh, well, I suppose there must be something in it, then. What a rotten\\nworld it is, though!”\\n\\n“You find it so?” I asked.\\n\\n“Good Lord, yes! There’s this terrible business to start with. Scotland\\nYard men in and out of the house like a jack-in-the-box! Never know\\nwhere they won’t turn up next. Screaming headlines in every paper in\\nthe country—damn all journalists, I say! Do you know there was a whole\\ncrowd staring in at the lodge gates this morning. Sort of Madame\\nTussaud’s chamber of horrors business that can be seen for nothing.\\nPretty thick, isn’t it?”\\n\\n“Cheer up, John!” I said soothingly. “It can’t last for ever.”\\n\\n“Can’t it, though? It can last long enough for us never to be able to\\nhold up our heads again.”\\n\\n“No, no, you’re getting morbid on the subject.”\\n\\n“Enough to make a man morbid, to be stalked by beastly journalists and\\nstared at by gaping moon-faced idiots, wherever he goes! But there’s\\nworse than that.”\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\nJohn lowered his voice:\\n\\n“Have you ever thought, Hastings—it’s a nightmare to me—who did it? I\\ncan’t help feeling sometimes it must have been an accident.\\nBecause—because—who could have done it? Now Inglethorp’s out of the\\nway, there’s no one else; no one, I mean, except—one of us.”\\n\\nYes, indeed, that was nightmare enough for any man! One of us? Yes,\\nsurely it must be so, unless——-\\n\\nA new idea suggested itself to my mind. Rapidly, I considered it. The\\nlight increased. Poirot’s mysterious doings, his hints—they all fitted\\nin. Fool that I was not to have thought of this possibility before, and\\nwhat a relief for us all.\\n\\n“No, John,” I said, “it isn’t one of us. How could it be?”\\n\\n“I know, but, still, who else is there?”\\n\\n“Can’t you guess?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\nI looked cautiously round, and lowered my voice.\\n\\n“Dr. Bauerstein!” I whispered.\\n\\n“Impossible!”\\n\\n“Not at all.”\\n\\n“But what earthly interest could he have in my mother’s death?”\\n\\n“That I don’t see,” I confessed, “but I’ll tell you this: Poirot thinks\\nso.”\\n\\n“Poirot? Does he? How do you know?”\\n\\nI told him of Poirot’s intense excitement on hearing that Dr.\\nBauerstein had been at Styles on the fatal night, and added:\\n\\n“He said twice: ‘That alters everything.’ And I’ve been thinking. You\\nknow Inglethorp said he had put down the coffee in the hall? Well, it\\nwas just then that Bauerstein arrived. Isn’t it possible that, as\\nInglethorp brought him through the hall, the doctor dropped something\\ninto the coffee in passing?”\\n\\n“H’m,” said John. “It would have been very risky.”\\n\\n“Yes, but it was possible.”\\n\\n“And then, how could he know it was her coffee? No, old fellow, I don’t\\nthink that will wash.”\\n\\nBut I had remembered something else.\\n\\n“You’re quite right. That wasn’t how it was done. Listen.” And I then\\ntold him of the cocoa sample which Poirot had taken to be analysed.\\n\\nJohn interrupted just as I had done.\\n\\n“But, look here, Bauerstein had had it analysed already?”\\n\\n“Yes, yes, that’s the point. I didn’t see it either until now. Don’t\\nyou understand? Bauerstein had it analysed—that’s just it! If\\nBauerstein’s the murderer, nothing could be simpler than for him to\\nsubstitute some ordinary cocoa for his sample, and send that to be\\ntested. And of course they would find no strychnine! But no one would\\ndream of suspecting Bauerstein, or think of taking another\\nsample—except Poirot,” I added, with belated recognition.\\n\\n“Yes, but what about the bitter taste that cocoa won’t disguise?”\\n\\n“Well, we’ve only his word for that. And there are other possibilities.\\nHe’s admittedly one of the world’s greatest toxicologists——”\\n\\n“One of the world’s greatest what? Say it again.”\\n\\n“He knows more about poisons than almost anybody,” I explained. “Well,\\nmy idea is, that perhaps he’s found some way of making strychnine\\ntasteless. Or it may not have been strychnine at all, but some obscure\\ndrug no one has ever heard of, which produces much the same symptoms.”\\n\\n“H’m, yes, that might be,” said John. “But look here, how could he have\\ngot at the cocoa? That wasn’t downstairs?”\\n\\n“No, it wasn’t,” I admitted reluctantly.\\n\\nAnd then, suddenly, a dreadful possibility flashed through my mind. I\\nhoped and prayed it would not occur to John also. I glanced sideways at\\nhim. He was frowning perplexedly, and I drew a deep breath of relief,\\nfor the terrible thought that had flashed across my mind was this: that\\nDr. Bauerstein might have had an accomplice.\\n\\nYet surely it could not be! Surely no woman as beautiful as Mary\\nCavendish could be a murderess. Yet beautiful women had been known to\\npoison.\\n\\nAnd suddenly I remembered that first conversation at tea on the day of\\nmy arrival, and the gleam in her eyes as she had said that poison was a\\nwoman’s weapon. How agitated she had been on that fatal Tuesday\\nevening! Had Mrs. Inglethorp discovered something between her and\\nBauerstein, and threatened to tell her husband? Was it to stop that\\ndenunciation that the crime had been committed?\\n\\nThen I remembered that enigmatical conversation between Poirot and\\nEvelyn Howard. Was this what they had meant? Was this the monstrous\\npossibility that Evelyn had tried not to believe?\\n\\nYes, it all fitted in.\\n\\nNo wonder Miss Howard had suggested “hushing it up.” Now I understood\\nthat unfinished sentence of hers: “Emily herself——” And in my heart I\\nagreed with her. Would not Mrs. Inglethorp have preferred to go\\nunavenged rather than have such terrible dishonour fall upon the name\\nof Cavendish.\\n\\n“There’s another thing,” said John suddenly, and the unexpected sound\\nof his voice made me start guiltily. “Something which makes me doubt if\\nwhat you say can be true.”\\n\\n“What’s that?” I asked, thankful that he had gone away from the subject\\nof how the poison could have been introduced into the cocoa.\\n\\n“Why, the fact that Bauerstein demanded a post-mortem. He needn’t have\\ndone so. Little Wilkins would have been quite content to let it go at\\nheart disease.”\\n\\n“Yes,” I said doubtfully. “But we don’t know. Perhaps he thought it\\nsafer in the long run. Someone might have talked afterwards. Then the\\nHome Office might have ordered exhumation. The whole thing would have\\ncome out, then, and he would have been in an awkward position, for no\\none would have believed that a man of his reputation could have been\\ndeceived into calling it heart disease.”\\n\\n“Yes, that’s possible,” admitted John. “Still,” he added, “I’m blest if\\nI can see what his motive could have been.”\\n\\nI trembled.\\n\\n“Look here,” I said, “I may be altogether wrong. And, remember, all\\nthis is in confidence.”\\n\\n“Oh, of course—that goes without saying.”\\n\\nWe had walked, as we talked, and now we passed through the little gate\\ninto the garden. Voices rose near at hand, for tea was spread out under\\nthe sycamore-tree, as it had been on the day of my arrival.\\n\\nCynthia was back from the hospital, and I placed my chair beside her,\\nand told her of Poirot’s wish to visit the dispensary.\\n\\n“Of course! I’d love him to see it. He’d better come to tea there one\\nday. I must fix it up with him. He’s such a dear little man! But he\\n_is_ funny. He made me take the brooch out of my tie the other day, and\\nput it in again, because he said it wasn’t straight.”\\n\\nI laughed.\\n\\n“It’s quite a mania with him.”\\n\\n“Yes, isn’t it?”\\n\\nWe were silent for a minute or two, and then, glancing in the direction\\nof Mary Cavendish, and dropping her voice, Cynthia said:\\n\\n“Mr. Hastings.”\\n\\n“Yes?”\\n\\n“After tea, I want to talk to you.”\\n\\nHer glance at Mary had set me thinking. I fancied that between these\\ntwo there existed very little sympathy. For the first time, it occurred\\nto me to wonder about the girl’s future. Mrs. Inglethorp had made no\\nprovisions of any kind for her, but I imagined that John and Mary would\\nprobably insist on her making her home with them—at any rate until the\\nend of the war. John, I knew, was very fond of her, and would be sorry\\nto let her go.\\n\\nJohn, who had gone into the house, now reappeared. His good-natured\\nface wore an unaccustomed frown of anger.\\n\\n“Confound those detectives! I can’t think what they’re after! They’ve\\nbeen in every room in the house—turning things inside out, and upside\\ndown. It really is too bad! I suppose they took advantage of our all\\nbeing out. I shall go for that fellow Japp, when I next see him!”\\n\\n“Lot of Paul Prys,” grunted Miss Howard.\\n\\nLawrence opined that they had to make a show of doing something.\\n\\nMary Cavendish said nothing.\\n\\nAfter tea, I invited Cynthia to come for a walk, and we sauntered off\\ninto the woods together.\\n\\n“Well?” I inquired, as soon as we were protected from prying eyes by\\nthe leafy screen.\\n\\nWith a sigh, Cynthia flung herself down, and tossed off her hat. The\\nsunlight, piercing through the branches, turned the auburn of her hair\\nto quivering gold.\\n\\n“Mr. Hastings—you are always so kind, and you know such a lot.”\\n\\nIt struck me at this moment that Cynthia was really a very charming\\ngirl! Much more charming than Mary, who never said things of that kind.\\n\\n“Well?” I asked benignantly, as she hesitated.\\n\\n“I want to ask your advice. What shall I do?”\\n\\n“Do?”\\n\\n“Yes. You see, Aunt Emily always told me I should be provided for. I\\nsuppose she forgot, or didn’t think she was likely to die—anyway, I am\\n_not_ provided for! And I don’t know what to do. Do you think I ought\\nto go away from here at once?”\\n\\n“Good heavens, no! They don’t want to part with you, I’m sure.”\\n\\nCynthia hesitated a moment, plucking up the grass with her tiny hands.\\nThen she said: “Mrs. Cavendish does. She hates me.”\\n\\n“Hates you?” I cried, astonished.\\n\\nCynthia nodded.\\n\\n“Yes. I don’t know why, but she can’t bear me; and _he_ can’t, either.”\\n\\n“There I know you’re wrong,” I said warmly. “On the contrary, John is\\nvery fond of you.”\\n\\n“Oh, yes—_John_. I meant Lawrence. Not, of course, that I care whether\\nLawrence hates me or not. Still, it’s rather horrid when no one loves\\nyou, isn’t it?”\\n\\n“But they do, Cynthia dear,” I said earnestly. “I’m sure you are\\nmistaken. Look, there is John—and Miss Howard——”\\n\\nCynthia nodded rather gloomily. “Yes, John likes me, I think, and of\\ncourse Evie, for all her gruff ways, wouldn’t be unkind to a fly. But\\nLawrence never speaks to me if he can help it, and Mary can hardly\\nbring herself to be civil to me. She wants Evie to stay on, is begging\\nher to, but she doesn’t want me, and—and—I don’t know what to do.”\\nSuddenly the poor child burst out crying.\\n\\nI don’t know what possessed me. Her beauty, perhaps, as she sat there,\\nwith the sunlight glinting down on her head; perhaps the sense of\\nrelief at encountering someone who so obviously could have no\\nconnection with the tragedy; perhaps honest pity for her youth and\\nloneliness. Anyway, I leant forward, and taking her little hand, I said\\nawkwardly:\\n\\n“Marry me, Cynthia.”\\n\\nUnwittingly, I had hit upon a sovereign remedy for her tears. She sat\\nup at once, drew her hand away, and said, with some asperity:\\n\\n“Don’t be silly!”\\n\\nI was a little annoyed.\\n\\n“I’m not being silly. I am asking you to do me the honour of becoming\\nmy wife.”\\n\\nTo my intense surprise, Cynthia burst out laughing, and called me a\\n“funny dear.”\\n\\n“It’s perfectly sweet of you,” she said, “but you know you don’t want\\nto!”\\n\\n“Yes, I do. I’ve got——”\\n\\n“Never mind what you’ve got. You don’t really want to—and I don’t\\neither.”\\n\\n“Well, of course, that settles it,” I said stiffly. “But I don’t see\\nanything to laugh at. There’s nothing funny about a proposal.”\\n\\n“No, indeed,” said Cynthia. “Somebody might accept you next time.\\nGood-bye, you’ve cheered me up _very_ much.”\\n\\nAnd, with a final uncontrollable burst of merriment, she vanished\\nthrough the trees.\\n\\nThinking over the interview, it struck me as being profoundly\\nunsatisfactory.\\n\\nIt occurred to me suddenly that I would go down to the village, and\\nlook up Bauerstein. Somebody ought to be keeping an eye on the fellow.\\nAt the same time, it would be wise to allay any suspicions he might\\nhave as to his being suspected. I remembered how Poirot had relied on\\nmy diplomacy. Accordingly, I went to the little house with the\\n“Apartments” card inserted in the window, where I knew he lodged, and\\ntapped on the door.\\n\\nAn old woman came and opened it.\\n\\n“Good afternoon,” I said pleasantly. “Is Dr. Bauerstein in?”\\n\\nShe stared at me.\\n\\n“Haven’t you heard?”\\n\\n“Heard what?”\\n\\n“About him.”\\n\\n“What about him?”\\n\\n“He’s took.”\\n\\n“Took? Dead?”\\n\\n“No, took by the perlice.”\\n\\n“By the police!” I gasped. “Do you mean they’ve arrested him?”\\n\\n“Yes, that’s it, and——”\\n\\nI waited to hear no more, but tore up the village to find Poirot.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X.\\nTHE ARREST\\n\\n\\nTo my extreme annoyance, Poirot was not in, and the old Belgian who\\nanswered my knock informed me that he believed he had gone to London.\\n\\nI was dumbfounded. What on earth could Poirot be doing in London! Was\\nit a sudden decision on his part, or had he already made up his mind\\nwhen he parted from me a few hours earlier?\\n\\nI retraced my steps to Styles in some annoyance. With Poirot away, I\\nwas uncertain how to act. Had he foreseen this arrest? Had he not, in\\nall probability, been the cause of it? Those questions I could not\\nresolve. But in the meantime what was I to do? Should I announce the\\narrest openly at Styles, or not? Though I did not acknowledge it to\\nmyself, the thought of Mary Cavendish was weighing on me. Would it not\\nbe a terrible shock to her? For the moment, I set aside utterly any\\nsuspicions of her. She could not be implicated—otherwise I should have\\nheard some hint of it.\\n\\nOf course, there was no possibility of being able permanently to\\nconceal Dr. Bauerstein’s arrest from her. It would be announced in\\nevery newspaper on the morrow. Still, I shrank from blurting it out. If\\nonly Poirot had been accessible, I could have asked his advice. What\\npossessed him to go posting off to London in this unaccountable way?\\n\\nIn spite of myself, my opinion of his sagacity was immeasurably\\nheightened. I would never have dreamt of suspecting the doctor, had not\\nPoirot put it into my head. Yes, decidedly, the little man was clever.\\n\\nAfter some reflecting, I decided to take John into my confidence, and\\nleave him to make the matter public or not, as he thought fit.\\n\\nHe gave vent to a prodigious whistle, as I imparted the news.\\n\\n“Great Scott! You _were_ right, then. I couldn’t believe it at the\\ntime.”\\n\\n“No, it is astonishing until you get used to the idea, and see how it\\nmakes everything fit in. Now, what are we to do? Of course, it will be\\ngenerally known to-morrow.”\\n\\nJohn reflected.\\n\\n“Never mind,” he said at last, “we won’t say anything at present. There\\nis no need. As you say, it will be known soon enough.”\\n\\nBut to my intense surprise, on getting down early the next morning, and\\neagerly opening the newspapers, there was not a word about the arrest!\\nThere was a column of mere padding about “The Styles Poisoning Case,”\\nbut nothing further. It was rather inexplicable, but I supposed that,\\nfor some reason or other, Japp wished to keep it out of the papers. It\\nworried me just a little, for it suggested the possibility that there\\nmight be further arrests to come.\\n\\nAfter breakfast, I decided to go down to the village, and see if Poirot\\nhad returned yet; but, before I could start, a well-known face blocked\\none of the windows, and the well-known voice said:\\n\\n“_Bonjour, mon ami!_”\\n\\n“Poirot,” I exclaimed, with relief, and seizing him by both hands, I\\ndragged him into the room. “I was never so glad to see anyone. Listen,\\nI have said nothing to anybody but John. Is that right?”\\n\\n“My friend,” replied Poirot, “I do not know what you are talking\\nabout.”\\n\\n“Dr. Bauerstein’s arrest, of course,” I answered impatiently.\\n\\n“Is Bauerstein arrested, then?”\\n\\n“Did you not know it?”\\n\\n“Not the least in the world.” But, pausing a moment, he added: “Still,\\nit does not surprise me. After all, we are only four miles from the\\ncoast.”\\n\\n“The coast?” I asked, puzzled. “What has that got to do with it?”\\n\\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n“Surely, it is obvious!”\\n\\n“Not to me. No doubt I am very dense, but I cannot see what the\\nproximity of the coast has got to do with the murder of Mrs.\\nInglethorp.”\\n\\n“Nothing at all, of course,” replied Poirot, smiling. “But we were\\nspeaking of the arrest of Dr. Bauerstein.”\\n\\n“Well, he is arrested for the murder of Mrs. Inglethorp——”\\n\\n“What?” cried Poirot, in apparently lively astonishment. “Dr.\\nBauerstein arrested for the murder of Mrs. Inglethorp?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“Impossible! That would be too good a farce! Who told you that, my\\nfriend?”\\n\\n“Well, no one exactly told me,” I confessed. “But he is arrested.”\\n\\n“Oh, yes, very likely. But for espionage, _mon ami_.”\\n\\n“Espionage?” I gasped.\\n\\n“Precisely.”\\n\\n“Not for poisoning Mrs. Inglethorp?”\\n\\n“Not unless our friend Japp has taken leave of his senses,” replied\\nPoirot placidly.\\n\\n“But—but I thought you thought so too?”\\n\\nPoirot gave me one look, which conveyed a wondering pity, and his full\\nsense of the utter absurdity of such an idea.\\n\\n“Do you mean to say,” I asked, slowly adapting myself to the new idea,\\n“that Dr. Bauerstein is a spy?”\\n\\nPoirot nodded.\\n\\n“Have you never suspected it?”\\n\\n“It never entered my head.”\\n\\n“It did not strike you as peculiar that a famous London doctor should\\nbury himself in a little village like this, and should be in the habit\\nof walking about at all hours of the night, fully dressed?”\\n\\n“No,” I confessed, “I never thought of such a thing.”\\n\\n“He is, of course, a German by birth,” said Poirot thoughtfully,\\n“though he has practised so long in this country that nobody thinks of\\nhim as anything but an Englishman. He was naturalized about fifteen\\nyears ago. A very clever man—a Jew, of course.”\\n\\n“The blackguard!” I cried indignantly.\\n\\n“Not at all. He is, on the contrary, a patriot. Think what he stands to\\nlose. I admire the man myself.”\\n\\nBut I could not look at it in Poirot’s philosophical way.\\n\\n“And this is the man with whom Mrs. Cavendish has been wandering about\\nall over the country!” I cried indignantly.\\n\\n“Yes. I should fancy he had found her very useful,” remarked Poirot.\\n“So long as gossip busied itself in coupling their names together, any\\nother vagaries of the doctor’s passed unobserved.”\\n\\n“Then you think he never really cared for her?” I asked eagerly—rather\\ntoo eagerly, perhaps, under the circumstances.\\n\\n“That, of course, I cannot say, but—shall I tell you my own private\\nopinion, Hastings?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“Well, it is this: that Mrs. Cavendish does not care, and never has\\ncared one little jot about Dr. Bauerstein!”\\n\\n“Do you really think so?” I could not disguise my pleasure.\\n\\n“I am quite sure of it. And I will tell you why.”\\n\\n“Yes?”\\n\\n“Because she cares for someone else, _mon ami_.”\\n\\n“Oh!” What did he mean? In spite of myself, an agreeable warmth spread\\nover me. I am not a vain man where women are concerned, but I\\nremembered certain evidences, too lightly thought of at the time,\\nperhaps, but which certainly seemed to indicate——\\n\\nMy pleasing thoughts were interrupted by the sudden entrance of Miss\\nHoward. She glanced round hastily to make sure there was no one else in\\nthe room, and quickly produced an old sheet of brown paper. This she\\nhanded to Poirot, murmuring as she did so the cryptic words:\\n\\n“On top of the wardrobe.” Then she hurriedly left the room.\\n\\nPoirot unfolded the sheet of paper eagerly, and uttered an exclamation\\nof satisfaction. He spread it out on the table.\\n\\n“Come here, Hastings. Now tell me, what is that initial—J. or L.?”\\n\\nIt was a medium sized sheet of paper, rather dusty, as though it had\\nlain by for some time. But it was the label that was attracting\\nPoirot’s attention. At the top, it bore the printed stamp of Messrs.\\nParkson’s, the well-known theatrical costumiers, and it was addressed\\nto “—(the debatable initial) Cavendish, Esq., Styles Court, Styles St.\\nMary, Essex.”\\n\\n“It might be T., or it might be L.,” I said, after studying the thing\\nfor a minute or two. “It certainly isn’t a J.”\\n\\n“Good,” replied Poirot, folding up the paper again. “I, also, am of\\nyour way of thinking. It is an L., depend upon it!”\\n\\n“Where did it come from?” I asked curiously. “Is it important?”\\n\\n“Moderately so. It confirms a surmise of mine. Having deduced its\\nexistence, I set Miss Howard to search for it, and, as you see, she has\\nbeen successful.”\\n\\n“What did she mean by ‘On the top of the wardrobe’?”\\n\\n“She meant,” replied Poirot promptly, “that she found it on top of a\\nwardrobe.”\\n\\n“A funny place for a piece of brown paper,” I mused.\\n\\n“Not at all. The top of a wardrobe is an excellent place for brown\\npaper and cardboard boxes. I have kept them there myself. Neatly\\narranged, there is nothing to offend the eye.”\\n\\n“Poirot,” I asked earnestly, “have you made up your mind about this\\ncrime?”\\n\\n“Yes—that is to say, I believe I know how it was committed.”\\n\\n“Ah!”\\n\\n“Unfortunately, I have no proof beyond my surmise, unless——” With\\nsudden energy, he caught me by the arm, and whirled me down the hall,\\ncalling out in French in his excitement: “Mademoiselle Dorcas,\\nMademoiselle Dorcas, _un moment, s’il vous plaît!_”\\n\\nDorcas, quite flurried by the noise, came hurrying out of the pantry.\\n\\n“My good Dorcas, I have an idea—a little idea—if it should prove\\njustified, what magnificent chance! Tell me, on Monday, not Tuesday,\\nDorcas, but Monday, the day before the tragedy, did anything go wrong\\nwith Mrs. Inglethorp’s bell?”\\n\\nDorcas looked very surprised.\\n\\n“Yes, sir, now you mention it, it did; though I don’t know how you came\\nto hear of it. A mouse, or some such, must have nibbled the wire\\nthrough. The man came and put it right on Tuesday morning.”\\n\\nWith a long drawn exclamation of ecstasy, Poirot led the way back to\\nthe morning-room.\\n\\n“See you, one should not ask for outside proof—no, reason should be\\nenough. But the flesh is weak, it is consolation to find that one is on\\nthe right track. Ah, my friend, I am like a giant refreshed. I run! I\\nleap!”\\n\\nAnd, in very truth, run and leap he did, gambolling wildly down the\\nstretch of lawn outside the long window.\\n\\n“What is your remarkable little friend doing?” asked a voice behind me,\\nand I turned to find Mary Cavendish at my elbow. She smiled, and so did\\nI. “What is it all about?”\\n\\n“Really, I can’t tell you. He asked Dorcas some question about a bell,\\nand appeared so delighted with her answer that he is capering about as\\nyou see!”\\n\\nMary laughed.\\n\\n“How ridiculous! He’s going out of the gate. Isn’t he coming back\\nto-day?”\\n\\n“I don’t know. I’ve given up trying to guess what he’ll do next.”\\n\\n“Is he quite mad, Mr. Hastings?”\\n\\n“I honestly don’t know. Sometimes, I feel sure he is as mad as a\\nhatter; and then, just as he is at his maddest, I find there is method\\nin his madness.”\\n\\n“I see.”\\n\\nIn spite of her laugh, Mary was looking thoughtful this morning. She\\nseemed grave, almost sad.\\n\\nIt occurred to me that it would be a good opportunity to tackle her on\\nthe subject of Cynthia. I began rather tactfully, _I_ thought, but I\\nhad not gone far before she stopped me authoritatively.\\n\\n“You are an excellent advocate, I have no doubt, Mr. Hastings, but in\\nthis case your talents are quite thrown away. Cynthia will run no risk\\nof encountering any unkindness from me.”\\n\\nI began to stammer feebly that I hoped she hadn’t thought—— But again\\nshe stopped me, and her words were so unexpected that they quite drove\\nCynthia, and her troubles, out of my mind.\\n\\n“Mr. Hastings,” she said, “do you think I and my husband are happy\\ntogether?”\\n\\nI was considerably taken aback, and murmured something about it’s not\\nbeing my business to think anything of the sort.\\n\\n“Well,” she said quietly, “whether it is your business or not, I will\\ntell you that we are _not_ happy.”\\n\\nI said nothing, for I saw that she had not finished.\\n\\nShe began slowly, walking up and down the room, her head a little bent,\\nand that slim, supple figure of hers swaying gently as she walked. She\\nstopped suddenly, and looked up at me.\\n\\n“You don’t know anything about me, do you?” she asked. “Where I come\\nfrom, who I was before I married John—anything, in fact? Well, I will\\ntell you. I will make a father confessor of you. You are kind, I\\nthink—yes, I am sure you are kind.”\\n\\nSomehow, I was not quite as elated as I might have been. I remembered\\nthat Cynthia had begun her confidences in much the same way. Besides, a\\nfather confessor should be elderly, it is not at all the role for a\\nyoung man.\\n\\n“My father was English,” said Mrs. Cavendish, “but my mother was a\\nRussian.”\\n\\n“Ah,” I said, “now I understand——”\\n\\n“Understand what?”\\n\\n“A hint of something foreign—different—that there has always been about\\nyou.”\\n\\n“My mother was very beautiful, I believe. I don’t know, because I never\\nsaw her. She died when I was quite a little child. I believe there was\\nsome tragedy connected with her death—she took an overdose of some\\nsleeping draught by mistake. However that may be, my father was\\nbroken-hearted. Shortly afterwards, he went into the Consular Service.\\nEverywhere he went, I went with him. When I was twenty-three, I had\\nbeen nearly all over the world. It was a splendid life—I loved it.”\\n\\nThere was a smile on her face, and her head was thrown back. She seemed\\nliving in the memory of those old glad days.\\n\\n“Then my father died. He left me very badly off. I had to go and live\\nwith some old aunts in Yorkshire.” She shuddered. “You will understand\\nme when I say that it was a deadly life for a girl brought up as I had\\nbeen. The narrowness, the deadly monotony of it, almost drove me mad.”\\nShe paused a minute, and added in a different tone: “And then I met\\nJohn Cavendish.”\\n\\n“Yes?”\\n\\n“You can imagine that, from my aunts’ point of view, it was a very good\\nmatch for me. But I can honestly say it was not this fact which weighed\\nwith me. No, he was simply a way of escape from the insufferable\\nmonotony of my life.”\\n\\nI said nothing, and after a moment, she went on:\\n\\n“Don’t misunderstand me. I was quite honest with him. I told him, what\\nwas true, that I liked him very much, that I hoped to come to like him\\nmore, but that I was not in any way what the world calls ‘in love’ with\\nhim. He declared that that satisfied him, and so—we were married.”\\n\\nShe waited a long time, a little frown had gathered on her forehead.\\nShe seemed to be looking back earnestly into those past days.\\n\\n“I think—I am sure—he cared for me at first. But I suppose we were not\\nwell matched. Almost at once, we drifted apart. He—it is not a pleasing\\nthing for my pride, but it is the truth—tired of me very soon.” I must\\nhave made some murmur of dissent, for she went on quickly: “Oh, yes, he\\ndid! Not that it matters now—now that we’ve come to the parting of the\\nways.”\\n\\n“What do you mean?”\\n\\nShe answered quietly:\\n\\n“I mean that I am not going to remain at Styles.”\\n\\n“You and John are not going to live here?”\\n\\n“John may live here, but I shall not.”\\n\\n“You are going to leave him?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“But why?”\\n\\nShe paused a long time, and said at last:\\n\\n“Perhaps—because I want to be—free!”\\n\\nAnd, as she spoke, I had a sudden vision of broad spaces, virgin tracts\\nof forests, untrodden lands—and a realization of what freedom would\\nmean to such a nature as Mary Cavendish. I seemed to see her for a\\nmoment as she was, a proud wild creature, as untamed by civilization as\\nsome shy bird of the hills. A little cry broke from her lips:\\n\\n“You don’t know, you don’t know, how this hateful place has been prison\\nto me!”\\n\\n“I understand,” I said, “but—but don’t do anything rash.”\\n\\n“Oh, rash!” Her voice mocked at my prudence.\\n\\nThen suddenly I said a thing I could have bitten out my tongue for:\\n\\n“You know that Dr. Bauerstein has been arrested?”\\n\\nAn instant coldness passed like a mask over her face, blotting out all\\nexpression.\\n\\n“John was so kind as to break that to me this morning.”\\n\\n“Well, what do you think?” I asked feebly.\\n\\n“Of what?”\\n\\n“Of the arrest?”\\n\\n“What should I think? Apparently he is a German spy; so the gardener\\nhad told John.”\\n\\nHer face and voice were absolutely cold and expressionless. Did she\\ncare, or did she not?\\n\\nShe moved away a step or two, and fingered one of the flower vases.\\n\\n“These are quite dead. I must do them again. Would you mind\\nmoving—thank you, Mr. Hastings.” And she walked quietly past me out of\\nthe window, with a cool little nod of dismissal.\\n\\nNo, surely she could not care for Bauerstein. No woman could act her\\npart with that icy unconcern.\\n\\nPoirot did not make his appearance the following morning, and there was\\nno sign of the Scotland Yard men.\\n\\nBut, at lunch-time, there arrived a new piece of evidence—or rather\\nlack of evidence. We had vainly tried to trace the fourth letter, which\\nMrs. Inglethorp had written on the evening preceding her death. Our\\nefforts having been in vain, we had abandoned the matter, hoping that\\nit might turn up of itself one day. And this is just what did happen,\\nin the shape of a communication, which arrived by the second post from\\na firm of French music publishers, acknowledging Mrs. Inglethorp’s\\ncheque, and regretting they had been unable to trace a certain series\\nof Russian folksongs. So the last hope of solving the mystery, by means\\nof Mrs. Inglethorp’s correspondence on the fatal evening, had to be\\nabandoned.\\n\\nJust before tea, I strolled down to tell Poirot of the new\\ndisappointment, but found, to my annoyance, that he was once more out.\\n\\n“Gone to London again?”\\n\\n“Oh, no, monsieur, he has but taken the train to Tadminster. ‘To see a\\nyoung lady’s dispensary,’ he said.”\\n\\n“Silly ass!” I ejaculated. “I told him Wednesday was the one day she\\nwasn’t there! Well, tell him to look us up to-morrow morning, will\\nyou?”\\n\\n“Certainly, monsieur.”\\n\\nBut, on the following day, no sign of Poirot. I was getting angry. He\\nwas really treating us in the most cavalier fashion.\\n\\nAfter lunch, Lawrence drew me aside, and asked if I was going down to\\nsee him.\\n\\n“No, I don’t think I shall. He can come up here if he wants to see us.”\\n\\n“Oh!” Lawrence looked indeterminate. Something unusually nervous and\\nexcited in his manner roused my curiosity.\\n\\n“What is it?” I asked. “I could go if there’s anything special.”\\n\\n“It’s nothing much, but—well, if you are going, will you tell him——” he\\ndropped his voice to a whisper—“I think I’ve found the extra\\ncoffee-cup!”\\n\\nI had almost forgotten that enigmatical message of Poirot’s, but now my\\ncuriosity was aroused afresh.\\n\\nLawrence would say no more, so I decided that I would descend from my\\nhigh horse, and once more seek out Poirot at Leastways Cottage.\\n\\nThis time I was received with a smile. Monsieur Poirot was within.\\nWould I mount? I mounted accordingly.\\n\\nPoirot was sitting by the table, his head buried in his hands. He\\nsprang up at my entrance.\\n\\n“What is it?” I asked solicitously. “You are not ill, I trust?”\\n\\n“No, no, not ill. But I decide an affair of great moment.”\\n\\n“Whether to catch the criminal or not?” I asked facetiously.\\n\\nBut, to my great surprise, Poirot nodded gravely.\\n\\n“‘To speak or not to speak,’ as your so great Shakespeare says, ‘that\\nis the question.’”\\n\\nI did not trouble to correct the quotation.\\n\\n“You are not serious, Poirot?”\\n\\n“I am of the most serious. For the most serious of all things hangs in\\nthe balance.”\\n\\n“And that is?”\\n\\n“A woman’s happiness, _mon ami_,” he said gravely.\\n\\nI did not quite know what to say.\\n\\n“The moment has come,” said Poirot thoughtfully, “and I do not know\\nwhat to do. For, see you, it is a big stake for which I play. No one\\nbut I, Hercule Poirot, would attempt it!” And he tapped himself proudly\\non the breast.\\n\\nAfter pausing a few minutes respectfully, so as not to spoil his\\neffect, I gave him Lawrence’s message.\\n\\n“Aha!” he cried. “So he has found the extra coffee-cup. That is good.\\nHe has more intelligence than would appear, this long-faced Monsieur\\nLawrence of yours!”\\n\\nI did not myself think very highly of Lawrence’s intelligence; but I\\nforebore to contradict Poirot, and gently took him to task for\\nforgetting my instructions as to which were Cynthia’s days off.\\n\\n“It is true. I have the head of a sieve. However, the other young lady\\nwas most kind. She was sorry for my disappointment, and showed me\\neverything in the kindest way.”\\n\\n“Oh, well, that’s all right, then, and you must go to tea with Cynthia\\nanother day.”\\n\\nI told him about the letter.\\n\\n“I am sorry for that,” he said. “I always had hopes of that letter. But\\nno, it was not to be. This affair must all be unravelled from within.”\\nHe tapped his forehead. “These little grey cells. It is ‘up to them’—as\\nyou say over here.” Then, suddenly, he asked: “Are you a judge of\\nfinger-marks, my friend?”\\n\\n“No,” I said, rather surprised, “I know that there are no two\\nfinger-marks alike, but that’s as far as my science goes.”\\n\\n“Exactly.”\\n\\nHe unlocked a little drawer, and took out some photographs which he\\nlaid on the table.\\n\\n“I have numbered them, 1, 2, 3. Will you describe them to me?”\\n\\nI studied the proofs attentively.\\n\\n“All greatly magnified, I see. No. 1, I should say, are a man’s\\nfinger-prints; thumb and first finger. No. 2 are a lady’s; they are\\nmuch smaller, and quite different in every way. No. 3”—I paused for\\nsome time—“there seem to be a lot of confused finger-marks, but here,\\nvery distinctly, are No. 1’s.”\\n\\n“Overlapping the others?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“You recognize them beyond fail?”\\n\\n“Oh, yes; they are identical.”\\n\\nPoirot nodded, and gently taking the photographs from me locked them up\\nagain.\\n\\n“I suppose,” I said, “that as usual, you are not going to explain?”\\n\\n“On the contrary. No. 1 were the finger-prints of Monsieur Lawrence.\\nNo. 2 were those of Mademoiselle Cynthia. They are not important. I\\nmerely obtained them for comparison. No. 3 is a little more\\ncomplicated.”\\n\\n“Yes?”\\n\\n“It is, as you see, highly magnified. You may have noticed a sort of\\nblur extending all across the picture. I will not describe to you the\\nspecial apparatus, dusting powder, etc., which I used. It is a\\nwell-known process to the police, and by means of it you can obtain a\\nphotograph of the finger-prints of any object in a very short space of\\ntime. Well, my friend, you have seen the finger-marks—it remains to\\ntell you the particular object on which they had been left.”\\n\\n“Go on—I am really excited.”\\n\\n“_Eh bien!_ Photo No. 3 represents the highly magnified surface of a\\ntiny bottle in the top poison cupboard of the dispensary in the Red\\nCross Hospital at Tadminster—which sounds like the house that Jack\\nbuilt!”\\n\\n“Good heavens!” I exclaimed. “But what were Lawrence Cavendish’s\\nfinger-marks doing on it? He never went near the poison cupboard the\\nday we were there!”\\n\\n“Oh, yes, he did!”\\n\\n“Impossible! We were all together the whole time.”\\n\\nPoirot shook his head.\\n\\n“No, my friend, there was a moment when you were not all together.\\nThere was a moment when you could not have been all together, or it\\nwould not have been necessary to call to Monsieur Lawrence to come and\\njoin you on the balcony.”\\n\\n“I’d forgotten that,” I admitted. “But it was only for a moment.”\\n\\n“Long enough.”\\n\\n“Long enough for what?”\\n\\nPoirot’s smile became rather enigmatical.\\n\\n“Long enough for a gentleman who had once studied medicine to gratify a\\nvery natural interest and curiosity.”\\n\\nOur eyes met. Poirot’s were pleasantly vague. He got up and hummed a\\nlittle tune. I watched him suspiciously.\\n\\n“Poirot,” I said, “what was in this particular little bottle?”\\n\\nPoirot looked out of the window.\\n\\n“Hydro-chloride of strychnine,” he said, over his shoulder, continuing\\nto hum.\\n\\n“Good heavens!” I said it quite quietly. I was not surprised. I had\\nexpected that answer.\\n\\n“They use the pure hydro-chloride of strychnine very little—only\\noccasionally for pills. It is the official solution, Liq. Strychnine\\nHydro-clor. that is used in most medicines. That is why the\\nfinger-marks have remained undisturbed since then.”\\n\\n“How did you manage to take this photograph?”\\n\\n“I dropped my hat from the balcony,” explained Poirot simply. “Visitors\\nwere not permitted below at that hour, so, in spite of my many\\napologies, Mademoiselle Cynthia’s colleague had to go down and fetch it\\nfor me.”\\n\\n“Then you knew what you were going to find?”\\n\\n“No, not at all. I merely realized that it was possible, from your\\nstory, for Monsieur Lawrence to go to the poison cupboard. The\\npossibility had to be confirmed, or eliminated.”\\n\\n“Poirot,” I said, “your gaiety does not deceive me. This is a very\\nimportant discovery.”\\n\\n“I do not know,” said Poirot. “But one thing does strike me. No doubt\\nit has struck you too.”\\n\\n“What is that?”\\n\\n“Why, that there is altogether too much strychnine about this case.\\nThis is the third time we run up against it. There was strychnine in\\nMrs. Inglethorp’s tonic. There is the strychnine sold across the\\ncounter at Styles St. Mary by Mace. Now we have more strychnine,\\nhandled by one of the household. It is confusing; and, as you know, I\\ndo not like confusion.”\\n\\nBefore I could reply, one of the other Belgians opened the door and\\nstuck his head in.\\n\\n“There is a lady below, asking for Mr Hastings.”\\n\\n“A lady?”\\n\\nI jumped up. Poirot followed me down the narrow stairs. Mary Cavendish\\nwas standing in the doorway.\\n\\n“I have been visiting an old woman in the village,” she explained, “and\\nas Lawrence told me you were with Monsieur Poirot I thought I would\\ncall for you.”\\n\\n“Alas, madame,” said Poirot, “I thought you had come to honour me with\\na visit!”\\n\\n“I will some day, if you ask me,” she promised him, smiling.\\n\\n“That is well. If you should need a father confessor, madame”—she\\nstarted ever so slightly—“remember, Papa Poirot is always at your\\nservice.”\\n\\nShe stared at him for a few minutes, as though seeking to read some\\ndeeper meaning into his words. Then she turned abruptly away.\\n\\n“Come, will you not walk back with us too, Monsieur Poirot?”\\n\\n“Enchanted, madame.”\\n\\nAll the way to Styles, Mary talked fast and feverishly. It struck me\\nthat in some way she was nervous of Poirot’s eyes.\\n\\nThe weather had broken, and the sharp wind was almost autumnal in its\\nshrewishness. Mary shivered a little, and buttoned her black sports\\ncoat closer. The wind through the trees made a mournful noise, like\\nsome great giant sighing.\\n\\nWe walked up to the great door of Styles, and at once the knowledge\\ncame to us that something was wrong.\\n\\nDorcas came running out to meet us. She was crying and wringing her\\nhands. I was aware of other servants huddled together in the\\nbackground, all eyes and ears.\\n\\n“Oh, m’am! Oh, m’am! I don’t know how to tell you——”\\n\\n“What is it, Dorcas?” I asked impatiently. “Tell us at once.”\\n\\n“It’s those wicked detectives. They’ve arrested him—they’ve arrested\\nMr. Cavendish!”\\n\\n“Arrested Lawrence?” I gasped.\\n\\nI saw a strange look come into Dorcas’s eyes.\\n\\n“No, sir. Not Mr. Lawrence—Mr. John.”\\n\\nBehind me, with a wild cry, Mary Cavendish fell heavily against me, and\\nas I turned to catch her I met the quiet triumph in Poirot’s eyes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI.\\nTHE CASE FOR THE PROSECUTION\\n\\n\\nThe trial of John Cavendish for the murder of his stepmother took place\\ntwo months later.\\n\\nOf the intervening weeks I will say little, but my admiration and\\nsympathy went out unfeignedly to Mary Cavendish. She ranged herself\\npassionately on her husband’s side, scorning the mere idea of his\\nguilt, and fought for him tooth and nail.\\n\\nI expressed my admiration to Poirot, and he nodded thoughtfully.\\n\\n“Yes, she is of those women who show at their best in adversity. It\\nbrings out all that is sweetest and truest in them. Her pride and her\\njealousy have——”\\n\\n“Jealousy?” I queried.\\n\\n“Yes. Have you not realized that she is an unusually jealous woman? As\\nI was saying, her pride and jealousy have been laid aside. She thinks\\nof nothing but her husband, and the terrible fate that is hanging over\\nhim.”\\n\\nHe spoke very feelingly, and I looked at him earnestly, remembering\\nthat last afternoon, when he had been deliberating whether or not to\\nspeak. With his tenderness for “a woman’s happiness,” I felt glad that\\nthe decision had been taken out of his hands.\\n\\n“Even now,” I said, “I can hardly believe it. You see, up to the very\\nlast minute, I thought it was Lawrence!”\\n\\nPoirot grinned.\\n\\n“I know you did.”\\n\\n“But John! My old friend John!”\\n\\n“Every murderer is probably somebody’s old friend,” observed Poirot\\nphilosophically. “You cannot mix up sentiment and reason.”\\n\\n“I must say I think you might have given me a hint.”\\n\\n“Perhaps, _mon ami_, I did not do so, just because he _was_ your old\\nfriend.”\\n\\nI was rather disconcerted by this, remembering how I had busily passed\\non to John what I believed to be Poirot’s views concerning Bauerstein.\\nHe, by the way, had been acquitted of the charge brought against him.\\nNevertheless, although he had been too clever for them this time, and\\nthe charge of espionage could not be brought home to him, his wings\\nwere pretty well clipped for the future.\\n\\nI asked Poirot whether he thought John would be condemned. To my\\nintense surprise, he replied that, on the contrary, he was extremely\\nlikely to be acquitted.\\n\\n“But, Poirot——” I protested.\\n\\n“Oh, my friend, have I not said to you all along that I have no proofs.\\nIt is one thing to know that a man is guilty, it is quite another\\nmatter to prove him so. And, in this case, there is terribly little\\nevidence. That is the whole trouble. I, Hercule Poirot, know, but I\\nlack the last link in my chain. And unless I can find that missing\\nlink——” He shook his head gravely.\\n\\n“When did you first suspect John Cavendish?” I asked, after a minute or\\ntwo.\\n\\n“Did you not suspect him at all?”\\n\\n“No, indeed.”\\n\\n“Not after that fragment of conversation you overheard between Mrs.\\nCavendish and her mother-in-law, and her subsequent lack of frankness\\nat the inquest?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“Did you not put two and two together, and reflect that if it was not\\nAlfred Inglethorp who was quarrelling with his wife—and you remember,\\nhe strenuously denied it at the inquest—it must be either Lawrence or\\nJohn. Now, if it was Lawrence, Mary Cavendish’s conduct was just as\\ninexplicable. But if, on the other hand, it was John, the whole thing\\nwas explained quite naturally.”\\n\\n“So,” I cried, a light breaking in upon me, “it was John who quarrelled\\nwith his mother that afternoon?”\\n\\n“Exactly.”\\n\\n“And you have known this all along?”\\n\\n“Certainly. Mrs. Cavendish’s behaviour could only be explained that\\nway.”\\n\\n“And yet you say he may be acquitted?”\\n\\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n“Certainly I do. At the police court proceedings, we shall hear the\\ncase for the prosecution, but in all probability his solicitors will\\nadvise him to reserve his defence. That will be sprung upon us at the\\ntrial. And—ah, by the way, I have a word of caution to give you, my\\nfriend. I must not appear in the case.”\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“No. Officially, I have nothing to do with it. Until I have found that\\nlast link in my chain, I must remain behind the scenes. Mrs. Cavendish\\nmust think I am working for her husband, not against him.”\\n\\n“I say, that’s playing it a bit low down,” I protested.\\n\\n“Not at all. We have to deal with a most clever and unscrupulous man,\\nand we must use any means in our power—otherwise he will slip through\\nour fingers. That is why I have been careful to remain in the\\nbackground. All the discoveries have been made by Japp, and Japp will\\ntake all the credit. If I am called upon to give evidence at all”—he\\nsmiled broadly—“it will probably be as a witness for the defence.”\\n\\nI could hardly believe my ears.\\n\\n“It is quite _en règle_,” continued Poirot. “Strangely enough, I can\\ngive evidence that will demolish one contention of the prosecution.”\\n\\n“Which one?”\\n\\n“The one that relates to the destruction of the will. John Cavendish\\ndid not destroy that will.”\\n\\nPoirot was a true prophet. I will not go into the details of the police\\ncourt proceedings, as it involves many tiresome repetitions. I will\\nmerely state baldly that John Cavendish reserved his defence, and was\\nduly committed for trial.\\n\\nSeptember found us all in London. Mary took a house in Kensington,\\nPoirot being included in the family party.\\n\\nI myself had been given a job at the War Office, so was able to see\\nthem continually.\\n\\nAs the weeks went by, the state of Poirot’s nerves grew worse and\\nworse. That “last link” he talked about was still lacking. Privately, I\\nhoped it might remain so, for what happiness could there be for Mary,\\nif John were not acquitted?\\n\\nOn September 15th John Cavendish appeared in the dock at the Old\\nBailey, charged with “The Wilful Murder of Emily Agnes Inglethorp,” and\\npleaded “Not Guilty.”\\n\\nSir Ernest Heavywether, the famous K.C., had been engaged to defend\\nhim.\\n\\nMr. Philips, K.C., opened the case for the Crown.\\n\\nThe murder, he said, was a most premeditated and cold-blooded one. It\\nwas neither more nor less than the deliberate poisoning of a fond and\\ntrusting woman by the stepson to whom she had been more than a mother.\\nEver since his boyhood, she had supported him. He and his wife had\\nlived at Styles Court in every luxury, surrounded by her care and\\nattention. She had been their kind and generous benefactress.\\n\\nHe proposed to call witnesses to show how the prisoner, a profligate\\nand spendthrift, had been at the end of his financial tether, and had\\nalso been carrying on an intrigue with a certain Mrs. Raikes, a\\nneighbouring farmer’s wife. This having come to his stepmother’s ears,\\nshe taxed him with it on the afternoon before her death, and a quarrel\\nensued, part of which was overheard. On the previous day, the prisoner\\nhad purchased strychnine at the village chemist’s shop, wearing a\\ndisguise by means of which he hoped to throw the onus of the crime upon\\nanother man—to wit, Mrs. Inglethorp’s husband, of whom he had been\\nbitterly jealous. Luckily for Mr. Inglethorp, he had been able to\\nproduce an unimpeachable alibi.\\n\\nOn the afternoon of July 17th, continued Counsel, immediately after the\\nquarrel with her son, Mrs. Inglethorp made a new will. This will was\\nfound destroyed in the grate of her bedroom the following morning, but\\nevidence had come to light which showed that it had been drawn up in\\nfavour of her husband. Deceased had already made a will in his favour\\nbefore her marriage, but—and Mr. Philips wagged an expressive\\nforefinger—the prisoner was not aware of that. What had induced the\\ndeceased to make a fresh will, with the old one still extant, he could\\nnot say. She was an old lady, and might possibly have forgotten the\\nformer one; or—this seemed to him more likely—she may have had an idea\\nthat it was revoked by her marriage, as there had been some\\nconversation on the subject. Ladies were not always very well versed in\\nlegal knowledge. She had, about a year before, executed a will in\\nfavour of the prisoner. He would call evidence to show that it was the\\nprisoner who ultimately handed his stepmother her coffee on the fatal\\nnight. Later in the evening, he had sought admission to her room, on\\nwhich occasion, no doubt, he found an opportunity of destroying the\\nwill which, as far as he knew, would render the one in his favour\\nvalid.\\n\\nThe prisoner had been arrested in consequence of the discovery, in his\\nroom, by Detective Inspector Japp—a most brilliant officer—of the\\nidentical phial of strychnine which had been sold at the village\\nchemist’s to the supposed Mr. Inglethorp on the day before the murder.\\nIt would be for the jury to decide whether or not these damning facts\\nconstituted an overwhelming proof of the prisoner’s guilt.\\n\\nAnd, subtly implying that a jury which did not so decide, was quite\\nunthinkable, Mr. Philips sat down and wiped his forehead.\\n\\nThe first witnesses for the prosecution were mostly those who had been\\ncalled at the inquest, the medical evidence being again taken first.\\n\\nSir Ernest Heavywether, who was famous all over England for the\\nunscrupulous manner in which he bullied witnesses, only asked two\\nquestions.\\n\\n“I take it, Dr. Bauerstein, that strychnine, as a drug, acts quickly?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“And that you are unable to account for the delay in this case?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“Thank you.”\\n\\nMr. Mace identified the phial handed him by Counsel as that sold by him\\nto “Mr. Inglethorp.” Pressed, he admitted that he only knew Mr.\\nInglethorp by sight. He had never spoken to him. The witness was not\\ncross-examined.\\n\\nAlfred Inglethorp was called, and denied having purchased the poison.\\nHe also denied having quarrelled with his wife. Various witnesses\\ntestified to the accuracy of these statements.\\n\\nThe gardeners’ evidence, as to the witnessing of the will was taken,\\nand then Dorcas was called.\\n\\nDorcas, faithful to her “young gentlemen,” denied strenuously that it\\ncould have been John’s voice she heard, and resolutely declared, in the\\nteeth of everything, that it was Mr. Inglethorp who had been in the\\nboudoir with her mistress. A rather wistful smile passed across the\\nface of the prisoner in the dock. He knew only too well how useless her\\ngallant defiance was, since it was not the object of the defence to\\ndeny this point. Mrs. Cavendish, of course, could not be called upon to\\ngive evidence against her husband.\\n\\nAfter various questions on other matters, Mr. Philips asked:\\n\\n“In the month of June last, do you remember a parcel arriving for Mr.\\nLawrence Cavendish from Parkson’s?”\\n\\nDorcas shook her head.\\n\\n“I don’t remember, sir. It may have done, but Mr. Lawrence was away\\nfrom home part of June.”\\n\\n“In the event of a parcel arriving for him whilst he was away, what\\nwould be done with it?”\\n\\n“It would either be put in his room or sent on after him.”\\n\\n“By you?”\\n\\n“No, sir, I should leave it on the hall table. It would be Miss Howard\\nwho would attend to anything like that.”\\n\\nEvelyn Howard was called and, after being examined on other points, was\\nquestioned as to the parcel.\\n\\n“Don’t remember. Lots of parcels come. Can’t remember one special one.”\\n\\n“You do not know if it was sent after Mr. Lawrence Cavendish to Wales,\\nor whether it was put in his room?”\\n\\n“Don’t think it was sent after him. Should have remembered it if it\\nwas.”\\n\\n“Supposing a parcel arrived addressed to Mr. Lawrence Cavendish, and\\nafterwards it disappeared, should you remark its absence?”\\n\\n“No, don’t think so. I should think someone had taken charge of it.”\\n\\n“I believe, Miss Howard, that it was you who found this sheet of brown\\npaper?” He held up the same dusty piece which Poirot and I had examined\\nin the morning-room at Styles.\\n\\n“Yes, I did.”\\n\\n“How did you come to look for it?”\\n\\n“The Belgian detective who was employed on the case asked me to search\\nfor it.”\\n\\n“Where did you eventually discover it?”\\n\\n“On the top of—of—a wardrobe.”\\n\\n“On top of the prisoner’s wardrobe?”\\n\\n“I—I believe so.”\\n\\n“Did you not find it yourself?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“Then you must know where you found it?”\\n\\n“Yes, it was on the prisoner’s wardrobe.”\\n\\n“That is better.”\\n\\nAn assistant from Parkson’s, Theatrical Costumiers, testified that on\\nJune 29th, they had supplied a black beard to Mr. L. Cavendish, as\\nrequested. It was ordered by letter, and a postal order was enclosed.\\nNo, they had not kept the letter. All transactions were entered in\\ntheir books. They had sent the beard, as directed, to “L. Cavendish,\\nEsq., Styles Court.”\\n\\nSir Ernest Heavywether rose ponderously.\\n\\n“Where was the letter written from?”\\n\\n“From Styles Court.”\\n\\n“The same address to which you sent the parcel?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“And the letter came from there?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\nLike a beast of prey, Heavywether fell upon him:\\n\\n“How do you know?”\\n\\n“I—I don’t understand.”\\n\\n“How do you know that letter came from Styles? Did you notice the\\npostmark?”\\n\\n“No—but——”\\n\\n“Ah, you did _not_ notice the postmark! And yet you affirm so\\nconfidently that it came from Styles. It might, in fact, have been any\\npostmark?”\\n\\n“Y—es.”\\n\\n“In fact, the letter, though written on stamped notepaper, might have\\nbeen posted from anywhere? From Wales, for instance?”\\n\\nThe witness admitted that such might be the case, and Sir Ernest\\nsignified that he was satisfied.\\n\\nElizabeth Wells, second housemaid at Styles, stated that after she had\\ngone to bed she remembered that she had bolted the front door, instead\\nof leaving it on the latch as Mr. Inglethorp had requested. She had\\naccordingly gone downstairs again to rectify her error. Hearing a\\nslight noise in the West wing, she had peeped along the passage, and\\nhad seen Mr. John Cavendish knocking at Mrs. Inglethorp’s door.\\n\\nSir Ernest Heavywether made short work of her, and under his unmerciful\\nbullying she contradicted herself hopelessly, and Sir Ernest sat down\\nagain with a satisfied smile on his face.\\n\\nWith the evidence of Annie, as to the candle grease on the floor, and\\nas to seeing the prisoner take the coffee into the boudoir, the\\nproceedings were adjourned until the following day.\\n\\nAs we went home, Mary Cavendish spoke bitterly against the prosecuting\\ncounsel.\\n\\n“That hateful man! What a net he has drawn around my poor John! How he\\ntwisted every little fact until he made it seem what it wasn’t!”\\n\\n“Well,” I said consolingly, “it will be the other way about to-morrow.”\\n\\n“Yes,” she said meditatively; then suddenly dropped her voice. “Mr.\\nHastings, you do not think—surely it could not have been Lawrence—Oh,\\nno, that could not be!”\\n\\nBut I myself was puzzled, and as soon as I was alone with Poirot I\\nasked him what he thought Sir Ernest was driving at.\\n\\n“Ah!” said Poirot appreciatively. “He is a clever man, that Sir\\nErnest.”\\n\\n“Do you think he believes Lawrence guilty?”\\n\\n“I do not think he believes or cares anything! No, what he is trying\\nfor is to create such confusion in the minds of the jury that they are\\ndivided in their opinion as to which brother did it. He is endeavouring\\nto make out that there is quite as much evidence against Lawrence as\\nagainst John—and I am not at all sure that he will not succeed.”\\n\\nDetective-inspector Japp was the first witness called when the trial\\nwas reopened, and gave his evidence succinctly and briefly. After\\nrelating the earlier events, he proceeded:\\n\\n“Acting on information received, Superintendent Summerhaye and myself\\nsearched the prisoner’s room, during his temporary absence from the\\nhouse. In his chest of drawers, hidden beneath some underclothing, we\\nfound: first, a pair of gold-rimmed pince-nez similar to those worn by\\nMr. Inglethorp”—these were exhibited—“secondly, this phial.”\\n\\nThe phial was that already recognized by the chemist’s assistant, a\\ntiny bottle of blue glass, containing a few grains of a white\\ncrystalline powder, and labelled: “Strychnine Hydro-chloride. POISON.”\\n\\nA fresh piece of evidence discovered by the detectives since the police\\ncourt proceedings was a long, almost new piece of blotting-paper. It\\nhad been found in Mrs. Inglethorp’s cheque book, and on being reversed\\nat a mirror, showed clearly the words: “. . . erything of which I die\\npossessed I leave to my beloved husband Alfred Ing...” This placed\\nbeyond question the fact that the destroyed will had been in favour of\\nthe deceased lady’s husband. Japp then produced the charred fragment of\\npaper recovered from the grate, and this, with the discovery of the\\nbeard in the attic, completed his evidence.\\n\\nBut Sir Ernest’s cross-examination was yet to come.\\n\\n“What day was it when you searched the prisoner’s room?”\\n\\n“Tuesday, the 24th of July.”\\n\\n“Exactly a week after the tragedy?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“You found these two objects, you say, in the chest of drawers. Was the\\ndrawer unlocked?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“Does it not strike you as unlikely that a man who had committed a\\ncrime should keep the evidence of it in an unlocked drawer for anyone\\nto find?”\\n\\n“He might have stowed them there in a hurry.”\\n\\n“But you have just said it was a whole week since the crime. He would\\nhave had ample time to remove them and destroy them.”\\n\\n“Perhaps.”\\n\\n“There is no perhaps about it. Would he, or would he not have had\\nplenty of time to remove and destroy them?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“Was the pile of underclothes under which the things were hidden heavy\\nor light?”\\n\\n“Heavyish.”\\n\\n“In other words, it was winter underclothing. Obviously, the prisoner\\nwould not be likely to go to that drawer?”\\n\\n“Perhaps not.”\\n\\n“Kindly answer my question. Would the prisoner, in the hottest week of\\na hot summer, be likely to go to a drawer containing winter\\nunderclothing. Yes, or no?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“In that case, is it not possible that the articles in question might\\nhave been put there by a third person, and that the prisoner was quite\\nunaware of their presence?”\\n\\n“I should not think it likely.”\\n\\n“But it is possible?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“That is all.”\\n\\nMore evidence followed. Evidence as to the financial difficulties in\\nwhich the prisoner had found himself at the end of July. Evidence as to\\nhis intrigue with Mrs. Raikes—poor Mary, that must have been bitter\\nhearing for a woman of her pride. Evelyn Howard had been right in her\\nfacts, though her animosity against Alfred Inglethorp had caused her to\\njump to the conclusion that he was the person concerned.\\n\\nLawrence Cavendish was then put into the box. In a low voice, in answer\\nto Mr. Philips’ questions, he denied having ordered anything from\\nParkson’s in June. In fact, on June 29th, he had been staying away, in\\nWales.\\n\\nInstantly, Sir Ernest’s chin was shooting pugnaciously forward.\\n\\n“You deny having ordered a black beard from Parkson’s on June 29th?”\\n\\n“I do.”\\n\\n“Ah! In the event of anything happening to your brother, who will\\ninherit Styles Court?”\\n\\nThe brutality of the question called a flush to Lawrence’s pale face.\\nThe judge gave vent to a faint murmur of disapprobation, and the\\nprisoner in the dock leant forward angrily.\\n\\nHeavywether cared nothing for his client’s anger.\\n\\n“Answer my question, if you please.”\\n\\n“I suppose,” said Lawrence quietly, “that I should.”\\n\\n“What do you mean by you ‘suppose’? Your brother has no children. You\\n_would_ inherit it, wouldn’t you?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“Ah, that’s better,” said Heavywether, with ferocious geniality. “And\\nyou’d inherit a good slice of money too, wouldn’t you?”\\n\\n“Really, Sir Ernest,” protested the judge, “these questions are not\\nrelevant.”\\n\\nSir Ernest bowed, and having shot his arrow proceeded.\\n\\n“On Tuesday, the 17th July, you went, I believe, with another guest, to\\nvisit the dispensary at the Red Cross Hospital in Tadminster?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“Did you—while you happened to be alone for a few seconds—unlock the\\npoison cupboard, and examine some of the bottles?”\\n\\n“I—I—may have done so.”\\n\\n“I put it to you that you did do so?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\nSir Ernest fairly shot the next question at him.\\n\\n“Did you examine one bottle in particular?”\\n\\n“No, I do not think so.”\\n\\n“Be careful, Mr. Cavendish. I am referring to a little bottle of\\nHydro-chloride of Strychnine.”\\n\\nLawrence was turning a sickly greenish colour.\\n\\n“N—o—I am sure I didn’t.”\\n\\n“Then how do you account for the fact that you left the unmistakable\\nimpress of your finger-prints on it?”\\n\\nThe bullying manner was highly efficacious with a nervous disposition.\\n\\n“I—I suppose I must have taken up the bottle.”\\n\\n“I suppose so too! Did you abstract any of the contents of the bottle?”\\n\\n“Certainly not.”\\n\\n“Then why did you take it up?”\\n\\n“I once studied to be a doctor. Such things naturally interest me.”\\n\\n“Ah! So poisons ‘naturally interest’ you, do they? Still, you waited to\\nbe alone before gratifying that ‘interest’ of yours?”\\n\\n“That was pure chance. If the others had been there, I should have done\\njust the same.”\\n\\n“Still, as it happens, the others were not there?”\\n\\n“No, but——”\\n\\n“In fact, during the whole afternoon, you were only alone for a couple\\nof minutes, and it happened—I say, it happened—to be during those two\\nminutes that you displayed your ‘natural interest’ in Hydro-chloride of\\nStrychnine?”\\n\\nLawrence stammered pitiably.\\n\\n“I—I——”\\n\\nWith a satisfied and expressive countenance, Sir Ernest observed:\\n\\n“I have nothing more to ask you, Mr. Cavendish.”\\n\\nThis bit of cross-examination had caused great excitement in court. The\\nheads of the many fashionably attired women present were busily laid\\ntogether, and their whispers became so loud that the judge angrily\\nthreatened to have the court cleared if there was not immediate\\nsilence.\\n\\nThere was little more evidence. The hand-writing experts were called\\nupon for their opinion of the signature of “Alfred Inglethorp” in the\\nchemist’s poison register. They all declared unanimously that it was\\ncertainly not his hand-writing, and gave it as their view that it might\\nbe that of the prisoner disguised. Cross-examined, they admitted that\\nit might be the prisoner’s hand-writing cleverly counterfeited.\\n\\nSir Ernest Heavywether’s speech in opening the case for the defence was\\nnot a long one, but it was backed by the full force of his emphatic\\nmanner. Never, he said, in the course of his long experience, had he\\nknown a charge of murder rest on slighter evidence. Not only was it\\nentirely circumstantial, but the greater part of it was practically\\nunproved. Let them take the testimony they had heard and sift it\\nimpartially. The strychnine had been found in a drawer in the\\nprisoner’s room. That drawer was an unlocked one, as he had pointed\\nout, and he submitted that there was no evidence to prove that it was\\nthe prisoner who had concealed the poison there. It was, in fact, a\\nwicked and malicious attempt on the part of some third person to fix\\nthe crime on the prisoner. The prosecution had been unable to produce a\\nshred of evidence in support of their contention that it was the\\nprisoner who ordered the black beard from Parkson’s. The quarrel which\\nhad taken place between prisoner and his stepmother was freely\\nadmitted, but both it and his financial embarrassments had been grossly\\nexaggerated.\\n\\nHis learned friend—Sir Ernest nodded carelessly at Mr. Philips—had\\nstated that if the prisoner were an innocent man, he would have come\\nforward at the inquest to explain that it was he, and not Mr.\\nInglethorp, who had been the participator in the quarrel. He thought\\nthe facts had been misrepresented. What had actually occurred was this.\\nThe prisoner, returning to the house on Tuesday evening, had been\\nauthoritatively told that there had been a violent quarrel between Mr.\\nand Mrs. Inglethorp. No suspicion had entered the prisoner’s head that\\nanyone could possibly have mistaken his voice for that of Mr.\\nInglethorp. He naturally concluded that his stepmother had had two\\nquarrels.\\n\\nThe prosecution averred that on Monday, July 16th, the prisoner had\\nentered the chemist’s shop in the village, disguised as Mr. Inglethorp.\\nThe prisoner, on the contrary, was at that time at a lonely spot called\\nMarston’s Spinney, where he had been summoned by an anonymous note,\\ncouched in blackmailing terms, and threatening to reveal certain\\nmatters to his wife unless he complied with its demands. The prisoner\\nhad, accordingly, gone to the appointed spot, and after waiting there\\nvainly for half an hour had returned home. Unfortunately, he had met\\nwith no one on the way there or back who could vouch for the truth of\\nhis story, but luckily he had kept the note, and it would be produced\\nas evidence.\\n\\nAs for the statement relating to the destruction of the will, the\\nprisoner had formerly practised at the Bar, and was perfectly well\\naware that the will made in his favour a year before was automatically\\nrevoked by his stepmother’s remarriage. He would call evidence to show\\nwho did destroy the will, and it was possible that that might open up\\nquite a new view of the case.\\n\\nFinally, he would point out to the jury that there was evidence against\\nother people besides John Cavendish. He would direct their attention to\\nthe fact that the evidence against Mr. Lawrence Cavendish was quite as\\nstrong, if not stronger than that against his brother.\\n\\nHe would now call the prisoner.\\n\\nJohn acquitted himself well in the witness-box. Under Sir Ernest’s\\nskilful handling, he told his tale credibly and well. The anonymous\\nnote received by him was produced, and handed to the jury to examine.\\nThe readiness with which he admitted his financial difficulties, and\\nthe disagreement with his stepmother, lent value to his denials.\\n\\nAt the close of his examination, he paused, and said:\\n\\n“I should like to make one thing clear. I utterly reject and disapprove\\nof Sir Ernest Heavywether’s insinuations against my brother. My\\nbrother, I am convinced, had no more to do with the crime than I have.”\\n\\nSir Ernest merely smiled, and noted with a sharp eye that John’s\\nprotest had produced a very favourable impression on the jury.\\n\\nThen the cross-examination began.\\n\\n“I understand you to say that it never entered your head that the\\nwitnesses at the inquest could possibly have mistaken your voice for\\nthat of Mr. Inglethorp. Is not that very surprising?”\\n\\n“No, I don’t think so. I was told there had been a quarrel between my\\nmother and Mr. Inglethorp, and it never occurred to me that such was\\nnot really the case.”\\n\\n“Not when the servant Dorcas repeated certain fragments of the\\nconversation—fragments which you must have recognized?”\\n\\n“I did not recognize them.”\\n\\n“Your memory must be unusually short!”\\n\\n“No, but we were both angry, and, I think, said more than we meant. I\\npaid very little attention to my mother’s actual words.”\\n\\nMr. Philips’ incredulous sniff was a triumph of forensic skill. He\\npassed on to the subject of the note.\\n\\n“You have produced this note very opportunely. Tell me, is there\\nnothing familiar about the hand-writing of it?”\\n\\n“Not that I know of.”\\n\\n“Do you not think that it bears a marked resemblance to your own\\nhand-writing—carelessly disguised?”\\n\\n“No, I do not think so.”\\n\\n“I put it to you that it is your own hand-writing!”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“I put it to you that, anxious to prove an alibi, you conceived the\\nidea of a fictitious and rather incredible appointment, and wrote this\\nnote yourself in order to bear out your statement!”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“Is it not a fact that, at the time you claim to have been waiting\\nabout at a solitary and unfrequented spot, you were really in the\\nchemist’s shop in Styles St. Mary, where you purchased strychnine in\\nthe name of Alfred Inglethorp?”\\n\\n“No, that is a lie.”\\n\\n“I put it to you that, wearing a suit of Mr. Inglethorp’s clothes, with\\na black beard trimmed to resemble his, you were there—and signed the\\nregister in his name!”\\n\\n“That is absolutely untrue.”\\n\\n“Then I will leave the remarkable similarity of hand-writing between\\nthe note, the register, and your own, to the consideration of the\\njury,” said Mr. Philips, and sat down with the air of a man who has\\ndone his duty, but who was nevertheless horrified by such deliberate\\nperjury.\\n\\nAfter this, as it was growing late, the case was adjourned till Monday.\\n\\nPoirot, I noticed, was looking profoundly discouraged. He had that\\nlittle frown between the eyes that I knew so well.\\n\\n“What is it, Poirot?” I inquired.\\n\\n“Ah, _mon ami_, things are going badly, badly.”\\n\\nIn spite of myself, my heart gave a leap of relief. Evidently there was\\na likelihood of John Cavendish being acquitted.\\n\\nWhen we reached the house, my little friend waved aside Mary’s offer of\\ntea.\\n\\n“No, I thank you, madame. I will mount to my room.”\\n\\nI followed him. Still frowning, he went across to the desk and took out\\na small pack of patience cards. Then he drew up a chair to the table,\\nand, to my utter amazement, began solemnly to build card houses!\\n\\nMy jaw dropped involuntarily, and he said at once:\\n\\n“No, _mon ami_, I am not in my second childhood! I steady my nerves,\\nthat is all. This employment requires precision of the fingers. With\\nprecision of the fingers goes precision of the brain. And never have I\\nneeded that more than now!”\\n\\n“What is the trouble?” I asked.\\n\\nWith a great thump on the table, Poirot demolished his carefully built\\nup edifice.\\n\\n“It is this, _mon ami!_ That I can build card houses seven stories\\nhigh, but I cannot”—thump—“find”—thump—“ that last link of which I\\nspoke to you.”\\n\\nI could not quite tell what to say, so I held my peace, and he began\\nslowly building up the cards again, speaking in jerks as he did so.\\n\\n“It is done—so! By placing—one card—on another—with\\nmathematical—precision!”\\n\\nI watched the card house rising under his hands, story by story. He\\nnever hesitated or faltered. It was really almost like a conjuring\\ntrick.\\n\\n“What a steady hand you’ve got,” I remarked. “I believe I’ve only seen\\nyour hand shake once.”\\n\\n“On an occasion when I was enraged, without doubt,” observed Poirot,\\nwith great placidity.\\n\\n“Yes indeed! You were in a towering rage. Do you remember? It was when\\nyou discovered that the lock of the despatch-case in Mrs. Inglethorp’s\\nbedroom had been forced. You stood by the mantelpiece, twiddling the\\nthings on it in your usual fashion, and your hand shook like a leaf! I\\nmust say——”\\n\\nBut I stopped suddenly. For Poirot, uttering a hoarse and inarticulate\\ncry, again annihilated his masterpiece of cards, and putting his hands\\nover his eyes swayed backwards and forwards, apparently suffering the\\nkeenest agony.\\n\\n“Good heavens, Poirot!” I cried. “What is the matter? Are you taken\\nill?”\\n\\n“No, no,” he gasped. “It is—it is—that I have an idea!”\\n\\n“Oh!” I exclaimed, much relieved. “One of your ‘little ideas’?”\\n\\n“Ah, _ma foi_, no!” replied Poirot frankly. “This time it is an idea\\ngigantic! Stupendous! And you—_you_, my friend, have given it to me!”\\n\\nSuddenly clasping me in his arms, he kissed me warmly on both cheeks,\\nand before I had recovered from my surprise ran headlong from the room.\\n\\nMary Cavendish entered at that moment.\\n\\n“What _is_ the matter with Monsieur Poirot? He rushed past me crying\\nout: ‘A garage! For the love of Heaven, direct me to a garage, madame!’\\nAnd, before I could answer, he had dashed out into the street.”\\n\\nI hurried to the window. True enough, there he was, tearing down the\\nstreet, hatless, and gesticulating as he went. I turned to Mary with a\\ngesture of despair.\\n\\n“He’ll be stopped by a policeman in another minute. There he goes,\\nround the corner!”\\n\\nOur eyes met, and we stared helplessly at one another.\\n\\n“What can be the matter?”\\n\\nI shook my head.\\n\\n“I don’t know. He was building card houses, when suddenly he said he\\nhad an idea, and rushed off as you saw.”\\n\\n“Well,” said Mary, “I expect he will be back before dinner.”\\n\\nBut night fell, and Poirot had not returned.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XII.\\nTHE LAST LINK\\n\\n\\nPoirot’s abrupt departure had intrigued us all greatly. Sunday morning\\nwore away, and still he did not reappear. But about three o’clock a\\nferocious and prolonged hooting outside drove us to the window, to see\\nPoirot alighting from a car, accompanied by Japp and Summerhaye. The\\nlittle man was transformed. He radiated an absurd complacency. He bowed\\nwith exaggerated respect to Mary Cavendish.\\n\\n“Madame, I have your permission to hold a little _réunion_ in the\\n_salon_? It is necessary for everyone to attend.”\\n\\nMary smiled sadly.\\n\\n“You know, Monsieur Poirot, that you have _carte blanche_ in every\\nway.”\\n\\n“You are too amiable, madame.”\\n\\nStill beaming, Poirot marshalled us all into the drawing-room, bringing\\nforward chairs as he did so.\\n\\n“Miss Howard—here. Mademoiselle Cynthia. Monsieur Lawrence. The good\\nDorcas. And Annie. _Bien!_ We must delay our proceedings a few minutes\\nuntil Mr. Inglethorp arrives. I have sent him a note.”\\n\\nMiss Howard rose immediately from her seat.\\n\\n“If that man comes into the house, I leave it!”\\n\\n“No, no!” Poirot went up to her and pleaded in a low voice.\\n\\nFinally Miss Howard consented to return to her chair. A few minutes\\nlater Alfred Inglethorp entered the room.\\n\\nThe company once assembled, Poirot rose from his seat with the air of a\\npopular lecturer, and bowed politely to his audience.\\n\\n“_Messieurs, mesdames_, as you all know, I was called in by Monsieur\\nJohn Cavendish to investigate this case. I at once examined the bedroom\\nof the deceased which, by the advice of the doctors, had been kept\\nlocked, and was consequently exactly as it had been when the tragedy\\noccurred. I found: first, a fragment of green material; second, a stain\\non the carpet near the window, still damp; thirdly, an empty box of\\nbromide powders.\\n\\n“To take the fragment of green material first, I found it caught in the\\nbolt of the communicating door between that room and the adjoining one\\noccupied by Mademoiselle Cynthia. I handed the fragment over to the\\npolice who did not consider it of much importance. Nor did they\\nrecognize it for what it was—a piece torn from a green land armlet.”\\n\\nThere was a little stir of excitement.\\n\\n“Now there was only one person at Styles who worked on the land—Mrs.\\nCavendish. Therefore it must have been Mrs. Cavendish who entered the\\ndeceased’s room through the door communicating with Mademoiselle\\nCynthia’s room.”\\n\\n“But that door was bolted on the inside!” I cried.\\n\\n“When I examined the room, yes. But in the first place we have only her\\nword for it, since it was she who tried that particular door and\\nreported it fastened. In the ensuing confusion she would have had ample\\nopportunity to shoot the bolt across. I took an early opportunity of\\nverifying my conjectures. To begin with, the fragment corresponds\\nexactly with a tear in Mrs. Cavendish’s armlet. Also, at the inquest,\\nMrs. Cavendish declared that she had heard, from her own room, the fall\\nof the table by the bed. I took an early opportunity of testing that\\nstatement by stationing my friend Monsieur Hastings in the left wing of\\nthe building, just outside Mrs. Cavendish’s door. I myself, in company\\nwith the police, went to the deceased’s room, and whilst there I,\\napparently accidentally, knocked over the table in question, but found\\nthat, as I had expected, Monsieur Hastings had heard no sound at all.\\nThis confirmed my belief that Mrs. Cavendish was not speaking the truth\\nwhen she declared that she had been dressing in her room at the time of\\nthe tragedy. In fact, I was convinced that, far from having been in her\\nown room, Mrs. Cavendish was actually in the deceased’s room when the\\nalarm was given.”\\n\\nI shot a quick glance at Mary. She was very pale, but smiling.\\n\\n“I proceeded to reason on that assumption. Mrs. Cavendish is in her\\nmother-in-law’s room. We will say that she is seeking for something and\\nhas not yet found it. Suddenly Mrs. Inglethorp awakens and is seized\\nwith an alarming paroxysm. She flings out her arm, overturning the bed\\ntable, and then pulls desperately at the bell. Mrs. Cavendish,\\nstartled, drops her candle, scattering the grease on the carpet. She\\npicks it up, and retreats quickly to Mademoiselle Cynthia’s room,\\nclosing the door behind her. She hurries out into the passage, for the\\nservants must not find her where she is. But it is too late! Already\\nfootsteps are echoing along the gallery which connects the two wings.\\nWhat can she do? Quick as thought, she hurries back to the young girl’s\\nroom, and starts shaking her awake. The hastily aroused household come\\ntrooping down the passage. They are all busily battering at Mrs.\\nInglethorp’s door. It occurs to nobody that Mrs. Cavendish has not\\narrived with the rest, but—and this is significant—I can find no one\\nwho saw her come from the other wing.” He looked at Mary Cavendish. “Am\\nI right, madame?”\\n\\nShe bowed her head.\\n\\n“Quite right, monsieur. You understand that, if I had thought I would\\ndo my husband any good by revealing these facts, I would have done so.\\nBut it did not seem to me to bear upon the question of his guilt or\\ninnocence.”\\n\\n“In a sense, that is correct, madame. But it cleared my mind of many\\nmisconceptions, and left me free to see other facts in their true\\nsignificance.”\\n\\n“The will!” cried Lawrence. “Then it was you, Mary, who destroyed the\\nwill?”\\n\\nShe shook her head, and Poirot shook his also.\\n\\n“No,” he said quietly. “There is only one person who could possibly\\nhave destroyed that will—Mrs. Inglethorp herself!”\\n\\n“Impossible!” I exclaimed. “She had only made it out that very\\nafternoon!”\\n\\n“Nevertheless, _mon ami_, it was Mrs. Inglethorp. Because, in no other\\nway can you account for the fact that, on one of the hottest days of\\nthe year, Mrs. Inglethorp ordered a fire to be lighted in her room.”\\n\\nI gave a gasp. What idiots we had been never to think of that fire as\\nbeing incongruous! Poirot was continuing:\\n\\n“The temperature on that day, messieurs, was 80 degrees in the shade.\\nYet Mrs. Inglethorp ordered a fire! Why? Because she wished to destroy\\nsomething, and could think of no other way. You will remember that, in\\nconsequence of the War economics practiced at Styles, no waste paper\\nwas thrown away. There was therefore no means of destroying a thick\\ndocument such as a will. The moment I heard of a fire being lighted in\\nMrs. Inglethorp’s room, I leaped to the conclusion that it was to\\ndestroy some important document—possibly a will. So the discovery of\\nthe charred fragment in the grate was no surprise to me. I did not, of\\ncourse, know at the time that the will in question had only been made\\nthis afternoon, and I will admit that, when I learnt that fact, I fell\\ninto a grievous error. I came to the conclusion that Mrs. Inglethorp’s\\ndetermination to destroy her will arose as a direct consequence of the\\nquarrel she had that afternoon, and that therefore the quarrel took\\nplace after, and not before the making of the will.\\n\\n“Here, as we know, I was wrong, and I was forced to abandon that idea.\\nI faced the problem from a new standpoint. Now, at four o’clock, Dorcas\\noverheard her mistress saying angrily: ‘You need not think that any\\nfear of publicity, or scandal between husband and wife will deter me.”\\nI conjectured, and conjectured rightly, that these words were\\naddressed, not to her husband, but to Mr. John Cavendish. At five\\no’clock, an hour later, she uses almost the same words, but the\\nstandpoint is different. She admits to Dorcas, ‘I don’t know what to\\ndo; scandal between husband and wife is a dreadful thing.’ At four\\no’clock she has been angry, but completely mistress of herself. At five\\no’clock she is in violent distress, and speaks of having had a great\\nshock.\\n\\n“Looking at the matter psychologically, I drew one deduction which I\\nwas convinced was correct. The second ‘scandal’ she spoke of was not\\nthe same as the first—and it concerned herself!\\n\\n“Let us reconstruct. At four o’clock, Mrs. Inglethorp quarrels with her\\nson, and threatens to denounce him to his wife—who, by the way,\\noverheard the greater part of the conversation. At four-thirty, Mrs.\\nInglethorp, in consequence of a conversation on the validity of wills,\\nmakes a will in favour of her husband, which the two gardeners witness.\\nAt five o’clock, Dorcas finds her mistress in a state of considerable\\nagitation, with a slip of paper—‘a letter,’ Dorcas thinks—in her hand,\\nand it is then that she orders the fire in her room to be lighted.\\nPresumably, then, between four-thirty and five o’clock, something has\\noccurred to occasion a complete revolution of feeling, since she is now\\nas anxious to destroy the will, as she was before to make it. What was\\nthat something?\\n\\n“As far as we know, she was quite alone during that half-hour. Nobody\\nentered or left that boudoir. What then occasioned this sudden change\\nof sentiment?\\n\\n“One can only guess, but I believe my guess to be correct. Mrs.\\nInglethorp had no stamps in her desk. We know this, because later she\\nasked Dorcas to bring her some. Now in the opposite corner of the room\\nstood her husband’s desk—locked. She was anxious to find some stamps,\\nand, according to my theory, she tried her own keys in the desk. That\\none of them fitted I know. She therefore opened the desk, and in\\nsearching for the stamps she came across something else—that slip of\\npaper which Dorcas saw in her hand, and which assuredly was never meant\\nfor Mrs. Inglethorp’s eyes. On the other hand, Mrs. Cavendish believed\\nthat the slip of paper to which her mother-in-law clung so tenaciously\\nwas a written proof of her own husband’s infidelity. She demanded it\\nfrom Mrs. Inglethorp who assured her, quite truly, that it had nothing\\nto do with that matter. Mrs. Cavendish did not believe her. She thought\\nthat Mrs. Inglethorp was shielding her stepson. Now Mrs. Cavendish is a\\nvery resolute woman, and, behind her mask of reserve, she was madly\\njealous of her husband. She determined to get hold of that paper at all\\ncosts, and in this resolution chance came to her aid. She happened to\\npick up the key of Mrs. Inglethorp’s despatch-case, which had been lost\\nthat morning. She knew that her mother-in-law invariably kept all\\nimportant papers in this particular case.\\n\\n“Mrs. Cavendish, therefore, made her plans as only a woman driven\\ndesperate through jealousy could have done. Some time in the evening\\nshe unbolted the door leading into Mademoiselle Cynthia’s room.\\nPossibly she applied oil to the hinges, for I found that it opened\\nquite noiselessly when I tried it. She put off her project until the\\nearly hours of the morning as being safer, since the servants were\\naccustomed to hearing her move about her room at that time. She dressed\\ncompletely in her land kit, and made her way quietly through\\nMademoiselle Cynthia’s room into that of Mrs. Inglethorp.”\\n\\nHe paused a moment, and Cynthia interrupted:\\n\\n“But I should have woken up if anyone had come through my room?”\\n\\n“Not if you were drugged, mademoiselle.”\\n\\n“Drugged?”\\n\\n“_Mais, oui!_”\\n\\n“You remember”—he addressed us collectively again—“that through all the\\ntumult and noise next door Mademoiselle Cynthia slept. That admitted of\\ntwo possibilities. Either her sleep was feigned—which I did not\\nbelieve—or her unconsciousness was induced by artificial means.\\n\\n“With this latter idea in my mind, I examined all the coffee-cups most\\ncarefully, remembering that it was Mrs. Cavendish who had brought\\nMademoiselle Cynthia her coffee the night before. I took a sample from\\neach cup, and had them analysed—with no result. I had counted the cups\\ncarefully, in the event of one having been removed. Six persons had\\ntaken coffee, and six cups were duly found. I had to confess myself\\nmistaken.\\n\\n“Then I discovered that I had been guilty of a very grave oversight.\\nCoffee had been brought in for seven persons, not six, for Dr.\\nBauerstein had been there that evening. This changed the face of the\\nwhole affair, for there was now one cup missing. The servants noticed\\nnothing, since Annie, the housemaid, who took in the coffee, brought in\\nseven cups, not knowing that Mr. Inglethorp never drank it, whereas\\nDorcas, who cleared them away the following morning, found six as\\nusual—or strictly speaking she found five, the sixth being the one\\nfound broken in Mrs. Inglethorp’s room.\\n\\n“I was confident that the missing cup was that of Mademoiselle Cynthia.\\nI had an additional reason for that belief in the fact that all the\\ncups found contained sugar, which Mademoiselle Cynthia never took in\\nher coffee. My attention was attracted by the story of Annie about some\\n‘salt’ on the tray of cocoa which she took every night to Mrs.\\nInglethorp’s room. I accordingly secured a sample of that cocoa, and\\nsent it to be analysed.”\\n\\n“But that had already been done by Dr. Bauerstein,” said Lawrence\\nquickly.\\n\\n“Not exactly. The analyst was asked by him to report whether strychnine\\nwas, or was not, present. He did not have it tested, as I did, for a\\nnarcotic.”\\n\\n“For a narcotic?”\\n\\n“Yes. Here is the analyst’s report. Mrs. Cavendish administered a safe,\\nbut effectual, narcotic to both Mrs. Inglethorp and Mademoiselle\\nCynthia. And it is possible that she had a _mauvais quart d’heure_ in\\nconsequence! Imagine her feelings when her mother-in-law is suddenly\\ntaken ill and dies, and immediately after she hears the word ‘Poison’!\\nShe has believed that the sleeping draught she administered was\\nperfectly harmless, but there is no doubt that for one terrible moment\\nshe must have feared that Mrs. Inglethorp’s death lay at her door. She\\nis seized with panic, and under its influence she hurries downstairs,\\nand quickly drops the coffee-cup and saucer used by Mademoiselle\\nCynthia into a large brass vase, where it is discovered later by\\nMonsieur Lawrence. The remains of the cocoa she dare not touch. Too\\nmany eyes are upon her. Guess at her relief when strychnine is\\nmentioned, and she discovers that after all the tragedy is not her\\ndoing.\\n\\n“We are now able to account for the symptoms of strychnine poisoning\\nbeing so long in making their appearance. A narcotic taken with\\nstrychnine will delay the action of the poison for some hours.”\\n\\nPoirot paused. Mary looked up at him, the colour slowly rising in her\\nface.\\n\\n“All you have said is quite true, Monsieur Poirot. It was the most\\nawful hour of my life. I shall never forget it. But you are wonderful.\\nI understand now——”\\n\\n“What I meant when I told you that you could safely confess to Papa\\nPoirot, eh? But you would not trust me.”\\n\\n“I see everything now,” said Lawrence. “The drugged cocoa, taken on top\\nof the poisoned coffee, amply accounts for the delay.”\\n\\n“Exactly. But was the coffee poisoned, or was it not? We come to a\\nlittle difficulty here, since Mrs. Inglethorp never drank it.”\\n\\n“What?” The cry of surprise was universal.\\n\\n“No. You will remember my speaking of a stain on the carpet in Mrs.\\nInglethorp’s room? There were some peculiar points about that stain. It\\nwas still damp, it exhaled a strong odour of coffee, and imbedded in\\nthe nap of the carpet I found some little splinters of china. What had\\nhappened was plain to me, for not two minutes before I had placed my\\nlittle case on the table near the window, and the table, tilting up,\\nhad deposited it upon the floor on precisely the identical spot. In\\nexactly the same way, Mrs. Inglethorp had laid down her cup of coffee\\non reaching her room the night before, and the treacherous table had\\nplayed her the same trick.\\n\\n“What happened next is mere guess work on my part, but I should say\\nthat Mrs. Inglethorp picked up the broken cup and placed it on the\\ntable by the bed. Feeling in need of a stimulant of some kind, she\\nheated up her cocoa, and drank it off then and there. Now we are faced\\nwith a new problem. We know the cocoa contained no strychnine. The\\ncoffee was never drunk. Yet the strychnine must have been administered\\nbetween seven and nine o’clock that evening. What third medium was\\nthere—a medium so suitable for disguising the taste of strychnine that\\nit is extraordinary no one has thought of it?” Poirot looked round the\\nroom, and then answered himself impressively. “Her medicine!”\\n\\n“Do you mean that the murderer introduced the strychnine into her\\ntonic?” I cried.\\n\\n“There was no need to introduce it. It was already there—in the\\nmixture. The strychnine that killed Mrs. Inglethorp was the identical\\nstrychnine prescribed by Dr. Wilkins. To make that clear to you, I will\\nread you an extract from a book on dispensing which I found in the\\nDispensary of the Red Cross Hospital at Tadminster:\\n\\n“‘The following prescription has become famous in text books:\\n\\n\\n          Strychninae Sulph. . . . . . 1 gr.\\n\\n          Potass Bromide . . . . . . . 3vi\\n\\n          Aqua ad. . . . . . . . . . . . . 3viii\\n\\n          Fiat Mistura\\n\\n\\n_This solution deposits in a few hours the greater part of the\\nstrychnine salt as an insoluble bromide in transparent crystals. A lady\\nin England lost her life by taking a similar mixture: the precipitated\\nstrychnine collected at the bottom, and in taking the last dose she\\nswallowed nearly all of it!_\\n\\n“Now there was, of course, no bromide in Dr. Wilkins’ prescription, but\\nyou will remember that I mentioned an empty box of bromide powders. One\\nor two of those powders introduced into the full bottle of medicine\\nwould effectually precipitate the strychnine, as the book describes,\\nand cause it to be taken in the last dose. You will learn later that\\nthe person who usually poured out Mrs. Inglethorp’s medicine was always\\nextremely careful not to shake the bottle, but to leave the sediment at\\nthe bottom of it undisturbed.\\n\\n“Throughout the case, there have been evidences that the tragedy was\\nintended to take place on Monday evening. On that day, Mrs.\\nInglethorp’s bell wire was neatly cut, and on Monday evening\\nMademoiselle Cynthia was spending the night with friends, so that Mrs.\\nInglethorp would have been quite alone in the right wing, completely\\nshut off from help of any kind, and would have died, in all\\nprobability, before medical aid could have been summoned. But in her\\nhurry to be in time for the village entertainment Mrs. Inglethorp\\nforgot to take her medicine, and the next day she lunched away from\\nhome, so that the last—and fatal—dose was actually taken twenty-four\\nhours later than had been anticipated by the murderer; and it is owing\\nto that delay that the final proof—the last link of the chain—is now in\\nmy hands.”\\n\\nAmid breathless excitement, he held out three thin strips of paper.\\n\\n“A letter in the murderer’s own hand-writing, _mes amis!_ Had it been a\\nlittle clearer in its terms, it is possible that Mrs. Inglethorp,\\nwarned in time, would have escaped. As it was, she realized her danger,\\nbut not the manner of it.”\\n\\nIn the deathly silence, Poirot pieced together the slips of paper and,\\nclearing his throat, read:\\n\\nDearest Evelyn:\\n\\n    ‘You will be anxious at hearing nothing. It is all right—only it\\n    will be to-night instead of last night. You understand. There’s a\\n    good time coming once the old woman is dead and out of the way. No\\n    one can possibly bring home the crime to me. That idea of yours\\n    about the bromides was a stroke of genius! But we must be very\\n    circumspect. A false step——’\\n\\n\\n“Here, my friends, the letter breaks off. Doubtless the writer was\\ninterrupted; but there can be no question as to his identity. We all\\nknow this hand-writing and——”\\n\\nA howl that was almost a scream broke the silence.\\n\\n“You devil! How did you get it?”\\n\\nA chair was overturned. Poirot skipped nimbly aside. A quick movement\\non his part, and his assailant fell with a crash.\\n\\n“_Messieurs, mesdames_,” said Poirot, with a flourish, “let me\\nintroduce you to the murderer, Mr. Alfred Inglethorp!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIII.\\nPOIROT EXPLAINS\\n\\n\\n“Poirot, you old villain,” I said, “I’ve half a mind to strangle you!\\nWhat do you mean by deceiving me as you have done?”\\n\\nWe were sitting in the library. Several hectic days lay behind us. In\\nthe room below, John and Mary were together once more, while Alfred\\nInglethorp and Miss Howard were in custody. Now at last, I had Poirot\\nto myself, and could relieve my still burning curiosity.\\n\\nPoirot did not answer me for a moment, but at last he said:\\n\\n“I did not deceive you, _mon ami_. At most, I permitted you to deceive\\nyourself.”\\n\\n“Yes, but why?”\\n\\n“Well, it is difficult to explain. You see, my friend, you have a\\nnature so honest, and a countenance so transparent, that—_enfin_, to\\nconceal your feelings is impossible! If I had told you my ideas, the\\nvery first time you saw Mr. Alfred Inglethorp that astute gentleman\\nwould have—in your so expressive idiom—‘smelt a rat’! And then,\\n_bonjour_ to our chances of catching him!”\\n\\n“I think that I have more diplomacy than you give me credit for.”\\n\\n“My friend,” besought Poirot, “I implore you, do not enrage yourself!\\nYour help has been of the most invaluable. It is but the extremely\\nbeautiful nature that you have, which made me pause.”\\n\\n“Well,” I grumbled, a little mollified. “I still think you might have\\ngiven me a hint.”\\n\\n“But I did, my friend. Several hints. You would not take them. Think\\nnow, did I ever say to you that I believed John Cavendish guilty? Did I\\nnot, on the contrary, tell you that he would almost certainly be\\nacquitted?”\\n\\n“Yes, but——”\\n\\n“And did I not immediately afterwards speak of the difficulty of\\nbringing the murderer to justice? Was it not plain to you that I was\\nspeaking of two entirely different persons?”\\n\\n“No,” I said, “it was not plain to me!”\\n\\n“Then again,” continued Poirot, “at the beginning, did I not repeat to\\nyou several times that I didn’t want Mr. Inglethorp arrested _now_?\\nThat should have conveyed something to you.”\\n\\n“Do you mean to say you suspected him as long ago as that?”\\n\\n“Yes. To begin with, whoever else might benefit by Mrs. Inglethorp’s\\ndeath, her husband would benefit the most. There was no getting away\\nfrom that. When I went up to Styles with you that first day, I had no\\nidea as to how the crime had been committed, but from what I knew of\\nMr. Inglethorp I fancied that it would be very hard to find anything to\\nconnect him with it. When I arrived at the château, I realized at once\\nthat it was Mrs. Inglethorp who had burnt the will; and there, by the\\nway, you cannot complain, my friend, for I tried my best to force on\\nyou the significance of that bedroom fire in midsummer.”\\n\\n“Yes, yes,” I said impatiently. “Go on.”\\n\\n“Well, my friend, as I say, my views as to Mr. Inglethorp’s guilt were\\nvery much shaken. There was, in fact, so much evidence against him that\\nI was inclined to believe that he had not done it.”\\n\\n“When did you change your mind?”\\n\\n“When I found that the more efforts I made to clear him, the more\\nefforts he made to get himself arrested. Then, when I discovered that\\nInglethorp had nothing to do with Mrs. Raikes and that in fact it was\\nJohn Cavendish who was interested in that quarter, I was quite sure.”\\n\\n“But why?”\\n\\n“Simply this. If it had been Inglethorp who was carrying on an intrigue\\nwith Mrs. Raikes, his silence was perfectly comprehensible. But, when I\\ndiscovered that it was known all over the village that it was John who\\nwas attracted by the farmer’s pretty wife, his silence bore quite a\\ndifferent interpretation. It was nonsense to pretend that he was afraid\\nof the scandal, as no possible scandal could attach to him. This\\nattitude of his gave me furiously to think, and I was slowly forced to\\nthe conclusion that Alfred Inglethorp wanted to be arrested. _Eh bien!_\\nfrom that moment, I was equally determined that he should not be\\narrested.”\\n\\n“Wait a minute. I don’t see why he wished to be arrested?”\\n\\n“Because, _mon ami_, it is the law of your country that a man once\\nacquitted can never be tried again for the same offence. Aha! but it\\nwas clever—his idea! Assuredly, he is a man of method. See here, he\\nknew that in his position he was bound to be suspected, so he conceived\\nthe exceedingly clever idea of preparing a lot of manufactured evidence\\nagainst himself. He wished to be arrested. He would then produce his\\nirreproachable alibi—and, hey presto, he was safe for life!”\\n\\n“But I still don’t see how he managed to prove his alibi, and yet go to\\nthe chemist’s shop?”\\n\\nPoirot stared at me in surprise.\\n\\n“Is it possible? My poor friend! You have not yet realized that it was\\nMiss Howard who went to the chemist’s shop?”\\n\\n“Miss Howard?”\\n\\n“But, certainly. Who else? It was most easy for her. She is of a good\\nheight, her voice is deep and manly; moreover, remember, she and\\nInglethorp are cousins, and there is a distinct resemblance between\\nthem, especially in their gait and bearing. It was simplicity itself.\\nThey are a clever pair!”\\n\\n“I am still a little fogged as to how exactly the bromide business was\\ndone,” I remarked.\\n\\n“_Bon!_ I will reconstruct for you as far as possible. I am inclined to\\nthink that Miss Howard was the master mind in that affair. You remember\\nher once mentioning that her father was a doctor? Possibly she\\ndispensed his medicines for him, or she may have taken the idea from\\none of the many books lying about when Mademoiselle Cynthia was\\nstudying for her exam. Anyway, she was familiar with the fact that the\\naddition of a bromide to a mixture containing strychnine would cause\\nthe precipitation of the latter. Probably the idea came to her quite\\nsuddenly. Mrs. Inglethorp had a box of bromide powders, which she\\noccasionally took at night. What could be easier than quietly to\\ndissolve one or more of those powders in Mrs. Inglethorp’s large sized\\nbottle of medicine when it came from Coot’s? The risk is practically\\nnil. The tragedy will not take place until nearly a fortnight later. If\\nanyone has seen either of them touching the medicine, they will have\\nforgotten it by that time. Miss Howard will have engineered her\\nquarrel, and departed from the house. The lapse of time, and her\\nabsence, will defeat all suspicion. Yes, it was a clever idea! If they\\nhad left it alone, it is possible the crime might never have been\\nbrought home to them. But they were not satisfied. They tried to be too\\nclever—and that was their undoing.”\\n\\nPoirot puffed at his tiny cigarette, his eyes fixed on the ceiling.\\n\\n“They arranged a plan to throw suspicion on John Cavendish, by buying\\nstrychnine at the village chemist’s, and signing the register in his\\nhand-writing.\\n\\n“On Monday Mrs. Inglethorp will take the last dose of her medicine. On\\nMonday, therefore, at six o’clock, Alfred Inglethorp arranges to be\\nseen by a number of people at a spot far removed from the village. Miss\\nHoward has previously made up a cock and bull story about him and Mrs.\\nRaikes to account for his holding his tongue afterwards. At six\\no’clock, Miss Howard, disguised as Alfred Inglethorp, enters the\\nchemist’s shop, with her story about a dog, obtains the strychnine, and\\nwrites the name of Alfred Inglethorp in John’s handwriting, which she\\nhad previously studied carefully.\\n\\n“But, as it will never do if John, too, can prove an alibi, she writes\\nhim an anonymous note—still copying his hand-writing—which takes him to\\na remote spot where it is exceedingly unlikely that anyone will see\\nhim.\\n\\n“So far, all goes well. Miss Howard goes back to Middlingham. Alfred\\nInglethorp returns to Styles. There is nothing that can compromise him\\nin any way, since it is Miss Howard who has the strychnine, which,\\nafter all, is only wanted as a blind to throw suspicion on John\\nCavendish.\\n\\n“But now a hitch occurs. Mrs. Inglethorp does not take her medicine\\nthat night. The broken bell, Cynthia’s absence—arranged by Inglethorp\\nthrough his wife—all these are wasted. And then—he makes his slip.\\n\\n“Mrs. Inglethorp is out, and he sits down to write to his accomplice,\\nwho, he fears, may be in a panic at the non-success of their plan. It\\nis probable that Mrs. Inglethorp returned earlier than he expected.\\nCaught in the act, and somewhat flurried he hastily shuts and locks his\\ndesk. He fears that if he remains in the room he may have to open it\\nagain, and that Mrs. Inglethorp might catch sight of the letter before\\nhe could snatch it up. So he goes out and walks in the woods, little\\ndreaming that Mrs. Inglethorp will open his desk, and discover the\\nincriminating document.\\n\\n“But this, as we know, is what happened. Mrs. Inglethorp reads it, and\\nbecomes aware of the perfidy of her husband and Evelyn Howard, though,\\nunfortunately, the sentence about the bromides conveys no warning to\\nher mind. She knows that she is in danger—but is ignorant of where the\\ndanger lies. She decides to say nothing to her husband, but sits down\\nand writes to her solicitor, asking him to come on the morrow, and she\\nalso determines to destroy immediately the will which she has just\\nmade. She keeps the fatal letter.”\\n\\n“It was to discover that letter, then, that her husband forced the lock\\nof the despatch-case?”\\n\\n“Yes, and from the enormous risk he ran we can see how fully he\\nrealized its importance. That letter excepted, there was absolutely\\nnothing to connect him with the crime.”\\n\\n“There’s only one thing I can’t make out, why didn’t he destroy it at\\nonce when he got hold of it?”\\n\\n“Because he did not dare take the biggest risk of all—that of keeping\\nit on his own person.”\\n\\n“I don’t understand.”\\n\\n“Look at it from his point of view. I have discovered that there were\\nonly five short minutes in which he could have taken it—the five\\nminutes immediately before our own arrival on the scene, for before\\nthat time Annie was brushing the stairs, and would have seen anyone who\\npassed going to the right wing. Figure to yourself the scene! He enters\\nthe room, unlocking the door by means of one of the other doorkeys—they\\nwere all much alike. He hurries to the despatch-case—it is locked, and\\nthe keys are nowhere to be seen. That is a terrible blow to him, for it\\nmeans that his presence in the room cannot be concealed as he had\\nhoped. But he sees clearly that everything must be risked for the sake\\nof that damning piece of evidence. Quickly, he forces the lock with a\\npenknife, and turns over the papers until he finds what he is looking\\nfor.\\n\\n“But now a fresh dilemma arises: he dare not keep that piece of paper\\non him. He may be seen leaving the room—he may be searched. If the\\npaper is found on him, it is certain doom. Probably, at this minute,\\ntoo, he hears the sounds below of Mr. Wells and John leaving the\\nboudoir. He must act quickly. Where can he hide this terrible slip of\\npaper? The contents of the waste-paper-basket are kept and in any case,\\nare sure to be examined. There are no means of destroying it; and he\\ndare not keep it. He looks round, and he sees—what do you think, _mon\\nami?_”\\n\\nI shook my head.\\n\\n“In a moment, he has torn the letter into long thin strips, and rolling\\nthem up into spills he thrusts them hurriedly in amongst the other\\nspills in the vase on the mantle-piece.”\\n\\nI uttered an exclamation.\\n\\n“No one would think of looking there,” Poirot continued. “And he will\\nbe able, at his leisure, to come back and destroy this solitary piece\\nof evidence against him.”\\n\\n“Then, all the time, it was in the spill vase in Mrs. Inglethorp’s\\nbedroom, under our very noses?” I cried.\\n\\nPoirot nodded.\\n\\n“Yes, my friend. That is where I discovered my ‘last link,’ and I owe\\nthat very fortunate discovery to you.”\\n\\n“To me?”\\n\\n“Yes. Do you remember telling me that my hand shook as I was\\nstraightening the ornaments on the mantelpiece?”\\n\\n“Yes, but I don’t see——”\\n\\n“No, but I saw. Do you know, my friend, I remembered that earlier in\\nthe morning, when we had been there together, I had straightened all\\nthe objects on the mantelpiece. And, if they were already straightened,\\nthere would be no need to straighten them again, unless, in the\\nmeantime, someone else had touched them.”\\n\\n“Dear me,” I murmured, “so that is the explanation of your\\nextraordinary behaviour. You rushed down to Styles, and found it still\\nthere?”\\n\\n“Yes, and it was a race for time.”\\n\\n“But I still can’t understand why Inglethorp was such a fool as to\\nleave it there when he had plenty of opportunity to destroy it.”\\n\\n“Ah, but he had no opportunity. _I_ saw to that.”\\n\\n“You?”\\n\\n“Yes. Do you remember reproving me for taking the household into my\\nconfidence on the subject?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“Well, my friend, I saw there was just one chance. I was not sure then\\nif Inglethorp was the criminal or not, but if he was I reasoned that he\\nwould not have the paper on him, but would have hidden it somewhere,\\nand by enlisting the sympathy of the household I could effectually\\nprevent his destroying it. He was already under suspicion, and by\\nmaking the matter public I secured the services of about ten amateur\\ndetectives, who would be watching him unceasingly, and being himself\\naware of their watchfulness he would not dare seek further to destroy\\nthe document. He was therefore forced to depart from the house, leaving\\nit in the spill vase.”\\n\\n“But surely Miss Howard had ample opportunities of aiding him.”\\n\\n“Yes, but Miss Howard did not know of the paper’s existence. In\\naccordance with their prearranged plan, she never spoke to Alfred\\nInglethorp. They were supposed to be deadly enemies, and until John\\nCavendish was safely convicted they neither of them dared risk a\\nmeeting. Of course I had a watch kept on Mr. Inglethorp, hoping that\\nsooner or later he would lead me to the hiding-place. But he was too\\nclever to take any chances. The paper was safe where it was; since no\\none had thought of looking there in the first week, it was not likely\\nthey would do so afterwards. But for your lucky remark, we might never\\nhave been able to bring him to justice.”\\n\\n“I understand that now; but when did you first begin to suspect Miss\\nHoward?”\\n\\n“When I discovered that she had told a lie at the inquest about the\\nletter she had received from Mrs. Inglethorp.”\\n\\n“Why, what was there to lie about?”\\n\\n“You saw that letter? Do you recall its general appearance?”\\n\\n“Yes—more or less.”\\n\\n“You will recollect, then, that Mrs. Inglethorp wrote a very\\ndistinctive hand, and left large clear spaces between her words. But if\\nyou look at the date at the top of the letter you will notice that\\n‘July 17th’ is quite different in this respect. Do you see what I\\nmean?”\\n\\n“No,” I confessed, “I don’t.”\\n\\n“You do not see that that letter was not written on the 17th, but on\\nthe 7th—the day after Miss Howard’s departure? The ‘1’ was written in\\nbefore the ‘7’ to turn it into the ‘17th’.”\\n\\n“But why?”\\n\\n“That is exactly what I asked myself. Why does Miss Howard suppress the\\nletter written on the 17th, and produce this faked one instead? Because\\nshe did not wish to show the letter of the 17th. Why, again? And at\\nonce a suspicion dawned in my mind. You will remember my saying that it\\nwas wise to beware of people who were not telling you the truth.”\\n\\n“And yet,” I cried indignantly, “after that, you gave me two reasons\\nwhy Miss Howard could not have committed the crime!”\\n\\n“And very good reasons too,” replied Poirot. “For a long time they were\\na stumbling-block to me until I remembered a very significant fact:\\nthat she and Alfred Inglethorp were cousins. She could not have\\ncommitted the crime single-handed, but the reasons against that did not\\ndebar her from being an accomplice. And, then, there was that rather\\nover-vehement hatred of hers! It concealed a very opposite emotion.\\nThere was, undoubtedly, a tie of passion between them long before he\\ncame to Styles. They had already arranged their infamous plot—that he\\nshould marry this rich, but rather foolish old lady, induce her to make\\na will leaving her money to him, and then gain their ends by a very\\ncleverly conceived crime. If all had gone as they planned, they would\\nprobably have left England, and lived together on their poor victim’s\\nmoney.\\n\\n“They are a very astute and unscrupulous pair. While suspicion was to\\nbe directed against him, she would be making quiet preparations for a\\nvery different _dénouement_. She arrives from Middlingham with all the\\ncompromising items in her possession. No suspicion attaches to her. No\\nnotice is paid to her coming and going in the house. She hides the\\nstrychnine and glasses in John’s room. She puts the beard in the attic.\\nShe will see to it that sooner or later they are duly discovered.”\\n\\n“I don’t quite see why they tried to fix the blame on John,” I\\nremarked. “It would have been much easier for them to bring the crime\\nhome to Lawrence.”\\n\\n“Yes, but that was mere chance. All the evidence against him arose out\\nof pure accident. It must, in fact, have been distinctly annoying to\\nthe pair of schemers.”\\n\\n“His manner was unfortunate,” I observed thoughtfully.\\n\\n“Yes. You realize, of course, what was at the back of that?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“You did not understand that he believed Mademoiselle Cynthia guilty of\\nthe crime?”\\n\\n“No,” I exclaimed, astonished. “Impossible!”\\n\\n“Not at all. I myself nearly had the same idea. It was in my mind when\\nI asked Mr. Wells that first question about the will. Then there were\\nthe bromide powders which she had made up, and her clever male\\nimpersonations, as Dorcas recounted them to us. There was really more\\nevidence against her than anyone else.”\\n\\n“You are joking, Poirot!”\\n\\n“No. Shall I tell you what made Monsieur Lawrence turn so pale when he\\nfirst entered his mother’s room on the fatal night? It was because,\\nwhilst his mother lay there, obviously poisoned, he saw, over your\\nshoulder, that the door into Mademoiselle Cynthia’s room was unbolted.”\\n\\n“But he declared that he saw it bolted!” I cried.\\n\\n“Exactly,” said Poirot dryly. “And that was just what confirmed my\\nsuspicion that it was not. He was shielding Mademoiselle Cynthia.”\\n\\n“But why should he shield her?”\\n\\n“Because he is in love with her.”\\n\\nI laughed.\\n\\n“There, Poirot, you are quite wrong! I happen to know for a fact that,\\nfar from being in love with her, he positively dislikes her.”\\n\\n“Who told you that, _mon ami?_”\\n\\n“Cynthia herself.”\\n\\n“_La pauvre petite!_ And she was concerned?”\\n\\n“She said that she did not mind at all.”\\n\\n“Then she certainly did mind very much,” remarked Poirot. “They are\\nlike that—_les femmes!_”\\n\\n“What you say about Lawrence is a great surprise to me,” I said.\\n\\n“But why? It was most obvious. Did not Monsieur Lawrence make the sour\\nface every time Mademoiselle Cynthia spoke and laughed with his\\nbrother? He had taken it into his long head that Mademoiselle Cynthia\\nwas in love with Monsieur John. When he entered his mother’s room, and\\nsaw her obviously poisoned, he jumped to the conclusion that\\nMademoiselle Cynthia knew something about the matter. He was nearly\\ndriven desperate. First he crushed the coffee-cup to powder under his\\nfeet, remembering that _she_ had gone up with his mother the night\\nbefore, and he determined that there should be no chance of testing its\\ncontents. Thenceforward, he strenuously, and quite uselessly, upheld\\nthe theory of ‘Death from natural causes’.”\\n\\n“And what about the ‘extra coffee-cup’?”\\n\\n“I was fairly certain that it was Mrs. Cavendish who had hidden it, but\\nI had to make sure. Monsieur Lawrence did not know at all what I meant;\\nbut, on reflection, he came to the conclusion that if he could find an\\nextra coffee-cup anywhere his lady love would be cleared of suspicion.\\nAnd he was perfectly right.”\\n\\n“One thing more. What did Mrs. Inglethorp mean by her dying words?”\\n\\n“They were, of course, an accusation against her husband.”\\n\\n“Dear me, Poirot,” I said with a sigh, “I think you have explained\\neverything. I am glad it has all ended so happily. Even John and his\\nwife are reconciled.”\\n\\n“Thanks to me.”\\n\\n“How do you mean—thanks to you?”\\n\\n“My dear friend, do you not realize that it was simply and solely the\\ntrial which has brought them together again? That John Cavendish still\\nloved his wife, I was convinced. Also, that she was equally in love\\nwith him. But they had drifted very far apart. It all arose from a\\nmisunderstanding. She married him without love. He knew it. He is a\\nsensitive man in his way, he would not force himself upon her if she\\ndid not want him. And, as he withdrew, her love awoke. But they are\\nboth unusually proud, and their pride held them inexorably apart. He\\ndrifted into an entanglement with Mrs. Raikes, and she deliberately\\ncultivated the friendship of Dr. Bauerstein. Do you remember the day of\\nJohn Cavendish’s arrest, when you found me deliberating over a big\\ndecision?”\\n\\n“Yes, I quite understood your distress.”\\n\\n“Pardon me, _mon ami_, but you did not understand it in the least. I\\nwas trying to decide whether or not I would clear John Cavendish at\\nonce. I could have cleared him—though it might have meant a failure to\\nconvict the real criminals. They were entirely in the dark as to my\\nreal attitude up to the very last moment—which partly accounts for my\\nsuccess.”\\n\\n“Do you mean that you could have saved John Cavendish from being\\nbrought to trial?”\\n\\n“Yes, my friend. But I eventually decided in favour of ‘a woman’s\\nhappiness’. Nothing but the great danger through which they have passed\\ncould have brought these two proud souls together again.”\\n\\nI looked at Poirot in silent amazement. The colossal cheek of the\\nlittle man! Who on earth but Poirot would have thought of a trial for\\nmurder as a restorer of conjugal happiness!\\n\\n“I perceive your thoughts, _mon ami_,” said Poirot, smiling at me. “No\\none but Hercule Poirot would have attempted such a thing! And you are\\nwrong in condemning it. The happiness of one man and one woman is the\\ngreatest thing in all the world.”\\n\\nHis words took me back to earlier events. I remembered Mary as she lay\\nwhite and exhausted on the sofa, listening, listening. There had come\\nthe sound of the bell below. She had started up. Poirot had opened the\\ndoor, and meeting her agonized eyes had nodded gently. “Yes, madame,”\\nhe said. “I have brought him back to you.” He had stood aside, and as I\\nwent out I had seen the look in Mary’s eyes, as John Cavendish had\\ncaught his wife in his arms.\\n\\n“Perhaps you are right, Poirot,” I said gently. “Yes, it is the\\ngreatest thing in the world.”\\n\\nSuddenly, there was a tap at the door, and Cynthia peeped in.\\n\\n“I—I only——”\\n\\n“Come in,” I said, springing up.\\n\\nShe came in, but did not sit down.\\n\\n“I—only wanted to tell you something——”\\n\\n“Yes?”\\n\\nCynthia fidgeted with a little tassel for some moments, then, suddenly\\nexclaiming: “You dears!” kissed first me and then Poirot, and rushed\\nout of the room again.\\n\\n“What on earth does this mean?” I asked, surprised.\\n\\nIt was very nice to be kissed by Cynthia, but the publicity of the\\nsalute rather impaired the pleasure.\\n\\n“It means that she has discovered Monsieur Lawrence does not dislike\\nher as much as she thought,” replied Poirot philosophically.\\n\\n“But——”\\n\\n“Here he is.”\\n\\nLawrence at that moment passed the door.\\n\\n“Eh! Monsieur Lawrence,” called Poirot. “We must congratulate you, is\\nit not so?”\\n\\nLawrence blushed, and then smiled awkwardly. A man in love is a sorry\\nspectacle. Now Cynthia had looked charming.\\n\\nI sighed.\\n\\n“What is it, _mon ami?_”\\n\\n“Nothing,” I said sadly. “They are two delightful women!”\\n\\n“And neither of them is for you?” finished Poirot. “Never mind. Console\\nyourself, my friend. We may hunt together again, who knows? And then——”\\n\\n\\nTHE END\\n',\n",

interest aroused in the public by what was known at the\\ntime as “the styles case” has now somewhat subsided. nevertheless, in\\nview of the world-wide notoriety which attended it, i have been asked,\\nboth by my friend poirot and the family themselves, to write an account\\nof the whole story. this, we trust, will effectually silence the\\nsensational rumours which still persist.\\n\\ni will therefore briefly set down the circumstances which led to my\\nbeing connected with the affair.\\n\\ni had been invalided home from the front; and, after spending some\\nmonths in a rather depressing convalescent home, was given a month’s\\nsick leave. having no near relations or friends, i was trying to make\\nup my mind what to do, when i ran across john cavendish. i had seen\\nvery little of him for some years. indeed, i had never known him\\nparticularly well. he was a good fifteen years my senior, for one\\nthing, though he hardly looked his forty-five years. as a boy, though,\\ni had often stayed at styles, his mother’s place in essex.\\n\\nwe had a good yarn about old times, and it ended in his inviting me\\ndown to styles to spend my leave there.\\n\\n“the mater will be delighted to see you again—after all those years,”\\nhe added.\\n\\n“your mother keeps well?” i asked.\\n\\n“oh, yes. i suppose you know that she has married again?”\\n\\ni am afraid i showed my surprise rather plainly. mrs. cavendish, who\\nhad married john’s father when he was a widower with two sons, had been\\na handsome woman of middle-age as i remembered her. she certainly could\\nnot be a day less than seventy now. i recalled her as an energetic,\\nautocratic personality, somewhat inclined to charitable and social\\nnotoriety, with a fondness for opening bazaars and playing the lady\\nbountiful. she was a most generous woman, and possessed a considerable\\nfortune of her own.\\n\\ntheir country-place, styles court, had been purchased by mr. cavendish\\nearly in their married life. he had been completely under his wife’s\\nascendancy, so much so that, on dying, he left the place to her for her\\nlifetime, as well as the larger part of his income; an arrangement that\\nwas distinctly unfair to his two sons. their step-mother, however, had\\nalways been most generous to them; indeed, they were so young at the\\ntime of their father’s remarriage that they always thought of her as\\ntheir own mother.\\n\\nlawrence, the younger, had been a delicate youth. he had qualified as a\\ndoctor but early relinquished the profession of medicine, and lived at\\nhome while pursuing literary ambitions; though his verses never had any\\nmarked success.\\n\\njohn practised for some time as a barrister, but had finally settled\\ndown to the more congenial life of a country squire. he had married two\\nyears ago, and had taken his wife to live at styles, though i\\nentertained a shrewd suspicion that he would have preferred his mother\\nto increase his allowance, which would have enabled him to have a home\\nof his own. mrs. cavendish, however, was a lady who liked to make her\\nown plans, and expected other people to fall in with them, and in this\\ncase she certainly had the whip hand, namely: the purse strings.\\n\\njohn noticed my surprise at the news of his mother’s remarriage and\\nsmiled rather ruefully.\\n\\n“rotten little bounder too!” he said savagely. “i can tell you,\\nhastings, it’s making life jolly difficult for us. as for evie—you\\nremember evie?”\\n\\n“no.”\\n\\n“oh, i suppose she was after your time. she’s the mater’s factotum,\\ncompanion, jack of all trades! a great sport—old evie! not precisely\\nyoung and beautiful, but as game as they make them.”\\n\\n“you were going to say——?”\\n\\n“oh, this fellow! he turned up from nowhere, on the pretext of being a\\nsecond cousin or something of evie’s, though she didn’t seem\\nparticularly keen to acknowledge the relationship. the fellow is an\\nabsolute outsider, anyone can see that. he’s got a great black beard,\\nand wears patent leather boots in all weathers! but the mater cottoned\\nto him at once, took him on as secretary—you know how she’s always\\nrunning a hundred societies?”\\n\\ni nodded.\\n\\n“well, of course the war has turned the hundreds into thousands. no\\ndoubt the fellow was very useful to her. but you could have knocked us\\nall down with a feather when, three months ago, she suddenly announced\\nthat she and alfred were engaged! the fellow must be at least twenty\\nyears younger than she is! it’s simply bare-faced fortune hunting; but\\nthere you are—she is her own mistress, and she’s married him.”\\n\\n“it must be a difficult situation for you all.”\\n\\n“difficult! it’s damnable!”\\n\\nthus it came about that, three days later, i descended from the train\\nat styles st. mary, an absurd little station, with no apparent reason\\nfor existence, perched up in the midst of green fields and country\\nlanes. john cavendish was waiting on the platform, and piloted me out\\nto the car.\\n\\n“got a drop or two of petrol still, you see,” he remarked. “mainly\\nowing to the mater’s activities.”\\n\\nthe village of styles st. mary was situated about two miles from the\\nlittle station, and styles court lay a mile the other side of it. it\\nwas a still, warm day in early july. as one looked out over the flat\\nessex country, lying so green and peaceful under the afternoon sun, it\\nseemed almost impossible to believe that, not so very far away, a great\\nwar was running its appointed course. i felt i had suddenly strayed\\ninto another world. as we turned in at the lodge gates, john said:\\n\\n“i’m afraid you’ll find it very quiet down here, hastings.”\\n\\n“my dear fellow, that’s just what i want.”\\n\\n“oh, it’s pleasant enough if you want to lead the idle life. i drill\\nwith the volunteers twice a week, and lend a hand at the farms. my wife\\nworks regularly ‘on the land’. she is up at five every morning to milk,\\nand keeps at it steadily until lunchtime. it’s a jolly good life taking\\nit all round—if it weren’t for that fellow alfred inglethorp!” he\\nchecked the car suddenly, and glanced at his watch. “i wonder if we’ve\\ntime to pick up cynthia. no, she’ll have started from the hospital by\\nnow.”\\n\\n“cynthia! that’s not your wife?”\\n\\n“no, cynthia is a protégée of my mother’s, the daughter of an old\\nschoolfellow of hers, who married a rascally solicitor. he came a\\ncropper, and the girl was left an orphan and penniless. my mother came\\nto the rescue, and cynthia has been with us nearly two years now. she\\nworks in the red cross hospital at tadminster, seven miles away.”\\n\\nas he spoke the last words, we drew up in front of the fine old house.\\na lady in a stout tweed skirt, who was bending over a flower bed,\\nstraightened herself at our approach.\\n\\n“hullo, evie, here’s our wounded hero! mr. hastings—miss howard.”\\n\\nmiss howard shook hands with a hearty, almost painful, grip. i had an\\nimpression of very blue eyes in a sunburnt face. she was a\\npleasant-looking woman of about forty, with a deep voice, almost manly\\nin its stentorian tones, and had a large sensible square body, with\\nfeet to match—these last encased in good thick boots. her conversation,\\ni soon found, was couched in the telegraphic style.\\n\\n“weeds grow like house afire. can’t keep even with ’em. shall press you\\nin. better be careful.”\\n\\n“i’m sure i shall be only too delighted to make myself useful,” i\\nresponded.\\n\\n“don’t say it. never does. wish you hadn’t later.”\\n\\n“you’re a cynic, evie,” said john, laughing. “where’s tea to-day—inside\\nor out?”\\n\\n“out. too fine a day to be cooped up in the house.”\\n\\n“come on then, you’ve done enough gardening for to-day. ‘the labourer\\nis worthy of his hire’, you know. come and be refreshed.”\\n\\n“well,” said miss howard, drawing off her gardening gloves, “i’m\\ninclined to agree with you.”\\n\\nshe led the way round the house to where tea was spread under the shade\\nof a large sycamore.\\n\\na figure rose from one of the basket chairs, and came a few steps to\\nmeet us.\\n\\n“my wife, hastings,” said john.\\n\\ni shall never forget my first sight of mary cavendish. her tall,\\nslender form, outlined against the bright light; the vivid sense of\\nslumbering fire that seemed to find expression only in those wonderful\\ntawny eyes of hers, remarkable eyes, different from any other woman’s\\nthat i have ever known; the intense power of stillness she possessed,\\nwhich nevertheless conveyed the impression of a wild untamed spirit in\\nan exquisitely civilised body—all these things are burnt into my\\nmemory. i shall never forget them.\\n\\nshe greeted me with a few words of pleasant welcome in a low clear\\nvoice, and i sank into a basket chair feeling distinctly glad that i\\nhad accepted john’s invitation. mrs. cavendish gave me some tea, and\\nher few quiet remarks heightened my first impression of her as a\\nthoroughly fascinating woman. an appreciative listener is always\\nstimulating, and i described, in a humorous manner, certain incidents\\nof my convalescent home, in a way which, i flatter myself, greatly\\namused my hostess. john, of course, good fellow though he is, could\\nhardly be called a brilliant conversationalist.\\n\\nat that moment a well remembered voice floated through the open french\\nwindow near at hand:\\n\\n“then you’ll write to the princess after tea, alfred? i’ll write to\\nlady tadminster for the second day, myself. or shall we wait until we\\nhear from the princess? in case of a refusal, lady tadminster might\\nopen it the first day, and mrs. crosbie the second. then there’s the\\nduchess—about the school fête.”\\n\\nthere was the murmur of a man’s voice, and then mrs. inglethorp’s rose\\nin reply:\\n\\n“yes, certainly. after tea will do quite well. you are so thoughtful,\\nalfred dear.”\\n\\nthe french window swung open a little wider, and a handsome\\nwhite-haired old lady, with a somewhat masterful cast of features,\\nstepped out of it on to the lawn. a man followed her, a suggestion of\\ndeference in his manner.\\n\\nmrs. inglethorp greeted me with effusion.\\n\\n“why, if it isn’t too delightful to see you again, mr. hastings, after\\nall these years. alfred, darling, mr. hastings—my husband.”\\n\\ni looked with some curiosity at “alfred darling”. he certainly struck a\\nrather alien note. i did not wonder at john objecting to his beard. it\\nwas one of the longest and blackest i have ever seen. he wore\\ngold-rimmed pince-nez, and had a curious impassivity of feature. it\\nstruck me that he might look natural on a stage, but was strangely out\\nof place in real life. his voice was rather deep and unctuous. he\\nplaced a wooden hand in mine and said:\\n\\n“this is a pleasure, mr. hastings.” then, turning to his wife: “emily\\ndearest, i think that cushion is a little damp.”\\n\\nshe beamed fondly on him, as he substituted another with every\\ndemonstration of the tenderest care. strange infatuation of an\\notherwise sensible woman!\\n\\nwith the presence of mr. inglethorp, a sense of constraint and veiled\\nhostility seemed to settle down upon the company. miss howard, in\\nparticular, took no pains to conceal her feelings. mrs. inglethorp,\\nhowever, seemed to notice nothing unusual. her volubility, which i\\nremembered of old, had lost nothing in the intervening years, and she\\npoured out a steady flood of conversation, mainly on the subject of the\\nforthcoming bazaar which she was organizing and which was to take place\\nshortly. occasionally she referred to her husband over a question of\\ndays or dates. his watchful and attentive manner never varied. from the\\nvery first i took a firm and rooted dislike to him, and i flatter\\nmyself that my first judgments are usually fairly shrewd.\\n\\npresently mrs. inglethorp turned to give some instructions about\\nletters to evelyn howard, and her husband addressed me in his\\npainstaking voice:\\n\\n“is soldiering your regular profession, mr. hastings?”\\n\\n“no, before the war i was in lloyd’s.”\\n\\n“and you will return there after it is over?”\\n\\n“perhaps. either that or a fresh start altogether.”\\n\\nmary cavendish leant forward.\\n\\n“what would you really choose as a profession, if you could just\\nconsult your inclination?”\\n\\n“well, that depends.”\\n\\n“no secret hobby?” she asked. “tell me—you’re drawn to something?\\neveryone is—usually something absurd.”\\n\\n“you’ll laugh at me.”\\n\\nshe smiled.\\n\\n“perhaps.”\\n\\n“well, i’ve always had a secret hankering to be a detective!”\\n\\n“the real thing—scotland yard? or sherlock holmes?”\\n\\n“oh, sherlock holmes by all means. but really, seriously, i am awfully\\ndrawn to it. i came across a man in belgium once, a very famous\\ndetective, and he quite inflamed me. he was a marvellous little fellow.\\nhe used to say that all good detective work was a mere matter of\\nmethod. my system is based on his—though of course i have progressed\\nrather further. he was a funny little man, a great dandy, but\\nwonderfully clever.”\\n\\n“like a good detective story myself,” remarked miss howard. “lots of\\nnonsense written, though. criminal discovered in last chapter. everyone\\ndumbfounded. real crime—you’d know at once.”\\n\\n“there have been a great number of undiscovered crimes,” i argued.\\n\\n“don’t mean the police, but the people that are right in it. the\\nfamily. you couldn’t really hoodwink them. they’d know.”\\n\\n“then,” i said, much amused, “you think that if you were mixed up in a\\ncrime, say a murder, you’d be able to spot the murderer right off?”\\n\\n“of course i should. mightn’t be able to prove it to a pack of lawyers.\\nbut i’m certain i’d know. i’d feel it in my fingertips if he came near\\nme.”\\n\\n“it might be a ‘she’,” i suggested.\\n\\n“might. but murder’s a violent crime. associate it more with a man.”\\n\\n“not in a case of poisoning.” mrs. cavendish’s clear voice startled me.\\n“dr. bauerstein was saying yesterday that, owing to the general\\nignorance of the more uncommon poisons among the medical profession,\\nthere were probably countless cases of poisoning quite unsuspected.”\\n\\n“why, mary, what a gruesome conversation!” cried mrs. inglethorp. “it\\nmakes me feel as if a goose were walking over my grave. oh, there’s\\ncynthia!”\\n\\na young girl in v.a.d. uniform ran lightly across the lawn.\\n\\n“why, cynthia, you are late to-day. this is mr. hastings—miss murdoch.”\\n\\ncynthia murdoch was a fresh-looking young creature, full of life and\\nvigour. she tossed off her little v.a.d. cap, and i admired the great\\nloose waves of her auburn hair, and the smallness and whiteness of the\\nhand she held out to claim her tea. with dark eyes and eyelashes she\\nwould have been a beauty.\\n\\nshe flung herself down on the ground beside john, and as i handed her a\\nplate of sandwiches she smiled up at me.\\n\\n“sit down here on the grass, do. it’s ever so much nicer.”\\n\\ni dropped down obediently.\\n\\n“you work at tadminster, don’t you, miss murdoch?”\\n\\nshe nodded.\\n\\n“for my sins.”\\n\\n“do they bully you, then?” i asked, smiling.\\n\\n“i should like to see them!” cried cynthia with dignity.\\n\\n“i have got a cousin who is nursing,” i remarked. “and she is terrified\\nof ‘sisters’.”\\n\\n“i don’t wonder. sisters _are_, you know, mr. hastings. they simp-ly\\n_are_! you’ve no idea! but i’m not a nurse, thank heaven, i work in the\\ndispensary.”\\n\\n“how many people do you poison?” i asked, smiling.\\n\\ncynthia smiled too.\\n\\n“oh, hundreds!” she said.\\n\\n“cynthia,” called mrs. inglethorp, “do you think you could write a few\\nnotes for me?”\\n\\n“certainly, aunt emily.”\\n\\nshe jumped up promptly, and something in her manner reminded me that\\nher position was a dependent one, and that mrs. inglethorp, kind as she\\nmight be in the main, did not allow her to forget it.\\n\\nmy hostess turned to me.\\n\\n“john will show you your room. supper is at half-past seven. we have\\ngiven up late dinner for some time now. lady tadminster, our member’s\\nwife—she was the late lord abbotsbury’s daughter—does the same. she\\nagrees with me that one must set an example of economy. we are quite a\\nwar household; nothing is wasted here—every scrap of waste paper, even,\\nis saved and sent away in sacks.”\\n\\ni expressed my appreciation, and john took me into the house and up the\\nbroad staircase, which forked right and left half-way to different\\nwings of the building. my room was in the left wing, and looked out\\nover the park.\\n\\njohn left me, and a few minutes later i saw him from my window walking\\nslowly across the grass arm in arm with cynthia murdoch. i heard mrs.\\ninglethorp call “cynthia” impatiently, and the girl started and ran\\nback to the house. at the same moment, a man stepped out from the\\nshadow of a tree and walked slowly in the same direction. he looked\\nabout forty, very dark with a melancholy clean-shaven face. some\\nviolent emotion seemed to be mastering him. he looked up at my window\\nas he passed, and i recognized him, though he had changed much in the\\nfifteen years that had elapsed since we last met. it was john’s younger\\nbrother, lawrence cavendish. i wondered what it was that had brought\\nthat singular expression to his face.\\n\\nthen i dismissed him from my mind, and returned to the contemplation of\\nmy own affairs.\\n\\nthe evening passed pleasantly enough; and i dreamed that night of that\\nenigmatical woman, mary cavendish.\\n\\nthe next morning dawned bright and sunny, and i was full of the\\nanticipation of a delightful visit.\\n\\ni did not see mrs. cavendish until lunch-time, when she volunteered to\\ntake me for a walk, and we spent a charming afternoon roaming in the\\nwoods, returning to the house about five.\\n\\nas we entered the large hall, john beckoned us both into the\\nsmoking-room. i saw at once by his face that something disturbing had\\noccurred. we followed him in, and he shut the door after us.\\n\\n“look here, mary, there’s the deuce of a mess. evie’s had a row with\\nalfred inglethorp, and she’s off.”\\n\\n“evie? off?”\\n\\njohn nodded gloomily.\\n\\n“yes; you see she went to the mater, and—oh,—here’s evie herself.”\\n\\nmiss howard entered. her lips were set grimly together, and she carried\\na small suit-case. she looked excited and determined, and slightly on\\nthe defensive.\\n\\n“at any rate,” she burst out, “i’ve spoken my mind!”\\n\\n“my dear evelyn,” cried mrs. cavendish, “this can’t be true!”\\n\\nmiss howard nodded grimly.\\n\\n“true enough! afraid i said some things to emily she won’t forget or\\nforgive in a hurry. don’t mind if they’ve only sunk in a bit. probably\\nwater off a duck’s back, though. i said right out: ‘you’re an old\\nwoman, emily, and there’s no fool like an old fool. the man’s twenty\\nyears younger than you, and don’t you fool yourself as to what he\\nmarried you for. money! well, don’t let him have too much of it. farmer\\nraikes has got a very pretty young wife. just ask your alfred how much\\ntime he spends over there.’ she was very angry. natural! i went on,\\n‘i’m going to warn you, whether you like it or not. that man would as\\nsoon murder you in your bed as look at you. he’s a bad lot. you can say\\nwhat you like to me, but remember what i’ve told you. he’s a bad lot!’”\\n\\n“what did she say?”\\n\\nmiss howard made an extremely expressive grimace.\\n\\n“‘darling alfred’—‘dearest alfred’—‘wicked calumnies’ —‘wicked\\nlies’—‘wicked woman’—to accuse her ‘dear husband!’ the sooner i left\\nher house the better. so i’m off.”\\n\\n“but not now?”\\n\\n“this minute!”\\n\\nfor a moment we sat and stared at her. finally john cavendish, finding\\nhis persuasions of no avail, went off to look up the trains. his wife\\nfollowed him, murmuring something about persuading mrs. inglethorp to\\nthink better of it.\\n\\nas she left the room, miss howard’s face changed. she leant towards me\\neagerly.\\n\\n“mr. hastings, you’re honest. i can trust you?”\\n\\ni was a little startled. she laid her hand on my arm, and sank her\\nvoice to a whisper.\\n\\n“look after her, mr. hastings. my poor emily. they’re a lot of\\nsharks—all of them. oh, i know what i’m talking about. there isn’t one\\nof them that’s not hard up and trying to get money out of her. i’ve\\nprotected her as much as i could. now i’m out of the way, they’ll\\nimpose upon her.”\\n\\n“of course, miss howard,” i said, “i’ll do everything i can, but i’m\\nsure you’re excited and overwrought.”\\n\\nshe interrupted me by slowly shaking her forefinger.\\n\\n“young man, trust me. i’ve lived in the world rather longer than you\\nhave. all i ask you is to keep your eyes open. you’ll see what i mean.”\\n\\nthe throb of the motor came through the open window, and miss howard\\nrose and moved to the door. john’s voice sounded outside. with her hand\\non the handle, she turned her head over her shoulder, and beckoned to\\nme.\\n\\n“above all, mr. hastings, watch that devil—her husband!”\\n\\nthere was no time for more. miss howard was swallowed up in an eager\\nchorus of protests and good-byes. the inglethorps did not appear.\\n\\nas the motor drove away, mrs. cavendish suddenly detached herself from\\nthe group, and moved across the drive to the lawn to meet a tall\\nbearded man who had been evidently making for the house. the colour\\nrose in her cheeks as she held out her hand to him.\\n\\n“who is that?” i asked sharply, for instinctively i distrusted the man.\\n\\n“that’s dr. bauerstein,” said john shortly.\\n\\n“and who is dr. bauerstein?”\\n\\n“he’s staying in the village doing a rest cure, after a bad nervous\\nbreakdown. he’s a london specialist; a very clever man—one of the\\ngreatest living experts on poisons, i believe.”\\n\\n“and he’s a great friend of mary’s,” put in cynthia, the irrepressible.\\n\\njohn cavendish frowned and changed the subject.\\n\\n“come for a stroll, hastings. this has been a most rotten business. she\\nalways had a rough tongue, but there is no stauncher friend in england\\nthan evelyn howard.”\\n\\nhe took the path through the plantation, and we walked down to the\\nvillage through the woods which bordered one side of the estate.\\n\\nas we passed through one of the gates on our way home again, a pretty\\nyoung woman of gipsy type coming in the opposite direction bowed and\\nsmiled.\\n\\n“that’s a pretty girl,” i remarked appreciatively.\\n\\njohn’s face hardened.\\n\\n“that is mrs. raikes.”\\n\\n“the one that miss howard——”\\n\\n“exactly,” said john, with rather unnecessary abruptness.\\n\\ni thought of the white-haired old lady in the big house, and that vivid\\nwicked little face that had just smiled into ours, and a vague chill of\\nforeboding crept over me. i brushed it aside.\\n\\n“styles is really a glorious old place,” i said to john.\\n\\nhe nodded rather gloomily.\\n\\n“yes, it’s a fine property. it’ll be mine some day—should be mine now\\nby rights, if my father had only made a decent will. and then i\\nshouldn’t be so damned hard up as i am now.”\\n\\n“hard up, are you?”\\n\\n“my dear hastings, i don’t mind telling you that i’m at my wits’ end\\nfor money.”\\n\\n“couldn’t your brother help you?”\\n\\n“lawrence? he’s gone through every penny he ever had, publishing rotten\\nverses in fancy bindings. no, we’re an impecunious lot. my mother’s\\nalways been awfully good to us, i must say. that is, up to now. since\\nher marriage, of course——” he broke off, frowning.\\n\\nfor the first time i felt that, with evelyn howard, something\\nindefinable had gone from the atmosphere. her presence had spelt\\nsecurity. now that security was removed—and the air seemed rife with\\nsuspicion. the sinister face of dr. bauerstein recurred to me\\nunpleasantly. a vague suspicion of everyone and everything filled my\\nmind. just for a moment i had a premonition of approaching evil.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter ii.\\nthe 16th and 17th of july\\n\\n\\ni had arrived at styles on the 5th of july. i come now to the events of\\nthe 16th and 17th of that month. for the convenience of the reader i\\nwill recapitulate the incidents of those days in as exact a manner as\\npossible. they were elicited subsequently at the trial by a process of\\nlong and tedious cross-examinations.\\n\\ni received a letter from evelyn howard a couple of days after her\\ndeparture, telling me she was working as a nurse at the big hospital in\\nmiddlingham, a manufacturing town some fifteen miles away, and begging\\nme to let her know if mrs. inglethorp should show any wish to be\\nreconciled.\\n\\nthe only fly in the ointment of my peaceful days was mrs. cavendish’s\\nextraordinary, and, for my part, unaccountable preference for the\\nsociety of dr. bauerstein. what she saw in the man i cannot imagine,\\nbut she was always asking him up to the house, and often went off for\\nlong expeditions with him. i must confess that i was quite unable to\\nsee his attraction.\\n\\nthe 16th of july fell on a monday. it was a day of turmoil. the famous\\nbazaar had taken place on saturday, and an entertainment, in connection\\nwith the same charity, at which mrs. inglethorp was to recite a war\\npoem, was to be held that night. we were all busy during the morning\\narranging and decorating the hall in the village where it was to take\\nplace. we had a late luncheon and spent the afternoon resting in the\\ngarden. i noticed that john’s manner was somewhat unusual. he seemed\\nvery excited and restless.\\n\\nafter tea, mrs. inglethorp went to lie down to rest before her efforts\\nin the evening and i challenged mary cavendish to a single at tennis.\\n\\nabout a quarter to seven, mrs. inglethorp called us that we should be\\nlate as supper was early that night. we had rather a scramble to get\\nready in time; and before the meal was over the motor was waiting at\\nthe door.\\n\\nthe entertainment was a great success, mrs. inglethorp’s recitation\\nreceiving tremendous applause. there were also some tableaux in which\\ncynthia took part. she did not return with us, having been asked to a\\nsupper party, and to remain the night with some friends who had been\\nacting with her in the tableaux.\\n\\nthe following morning, mrs. inglethorp stayed in bed to breakfast, as\\nshe was rather overtired; but she appeared in her briskest mood about\\n12.30, and swept lawrence and myself off to a luncheon party.\\n\\n“such a charming invitation from mrs. rolleston. lady tadminster’s\\nsister, you know. the rollestons came over with the conqueror—one of\\nour oldest families.”\\n\\nmary had excused herself on the plea of an engagement with dr.\\nbauerstein.\\n\\nwe had a pleasant luncheon, and as we drove away lawrence suggested\\nthat we should return by tadminster, which was barely a mile out of our\\nway, and pay a visit to cynthia in her dispensary. mrs. inglethorp\\nreplied that this was an excellent idea, but as she had several letters\\nto write she would drop us there, and we could come back with cynthia\\nin the pony-trap.\\n\\nwe were detained under suspicion by the hospital porter, until cynthia\\nappeared to vouch for us, looking very cool and sweet in her long white\\noverall. she took us up to her sanctum, and introduced us to her fellow\\ndispenser, a rather awe-inspiring individual, whom cynthia cheerily\\naddressed as “nibs.”\\n\\n“what a lot of bottles!” i exclaimed, as my eye travelled round the\\nsmall room. “do you really know what’s in them all?”\\n\\n“say something original,” groaned cynthia. “every single person who\\ncomes up here says that. we are really thinking of bestowing a prize on\\nthe first individual who does _not_ say: ‘what a lot of bottles!’ and i\\nknow the next thing you’re going to say is: ‘how many people have you\\npoisoned?’”\\n\\ni pleaded guilty with a laugh.\\n\\n“if you people only knew how fatally easy it is to poison someone by\\nmistake, you wouldn’t joke about it. come on, let’s have tea. we’ve got\\nall sorts of secret stores in that cupboard. no, lawrence—that’s the\\npoison cupboard. the big cupboard—that’s right.”\\n\\nwe had a very cheery tea, and assisted cynthia to wash up afterwards.\\nwe had just put away the last tea-spoon when a knock came at the door.\\nthe countenances of cynthia and nibs were suddenly petrified into a\\nstern and forbidding expression.\\n\\n“come in,” said cynthia, in a sharp professional tone.\\n\\na young and rather scared looking nurse appeared with a bottle which\\nshe proffered to nibs, who waved her towards cynthia with the somewhat\\nenigmatical remark:\\n\\n“_i_’m not really here to-day.”\\n\\ncynthia took the bottle and examined it with the severity of a judge.\\n\\n“this should have been sent up this morning.”\\n\\n“sister is very sorry. she forgot.”\\n\\n“sister should read the rules outside the door.”\\n\\ni gathered from the little nurse’s expression that there was not the\\nleast likelihood of her having the hardihood to retail this message to\\nthe dreaded “sister”.\\n\\n“so now it can’t be done until to-morrow,” finished cynthia.\\n\\n“don’t you think you could possibly let us have it to-night?”\\n\\n“well,” said cynthia graciously, “we are very busy, but if we have time\\nit shall be done.”\\n\\nthe little nurse withdrew, and cynthia promptly took a jar from the\\nshelf, refilled the bottle, and placed it on the table outside the\\ndoor.\\n\\ni laughed.\\n\\n“discipline must be maintained?”\\n\\n“exactly. come out on our little balcony. you can see all the outside\\nwards there.”\\n\\ni followed cynthia and her friend and they pointed out the different\\nwards to me. lawrence remained behind, but after a few moments cynthia\\ncalled to him over her shoulder to come and join us. then she looked at\\nher watch.\\n\\n“nothing more to do, nibs?”\\n\\n“no.”\\n\\n“all right. then we can lock up and go.”\\n\\ni had seen lawrence in quite a different light that afternoon. compared\\nto john, he was an astoundingly difficult person to get to know. he was\\nthe opposite of his brother in almost every respect, being unusually\\nshy and reserved. yet he had a certain charm of manner, and i fancied\\nthat, if one really knew him well, one could have a deep affection for\\nhim. i had always fancied that his manner to cynthia was rather\\nconstrained, and that she on her side was inclined to be shy of him.\\nbut they were both gay enough this afternoon, and chatted together like\\na couple of children.\\n\\nas we drove through the village, i remembered that i wanted some\\nstamps, so accordingly we pulled up at the post office.\\n\\nas i came out again, i cannoned into a little man who was just\\nentering. i drew aside and apologised, when suddenly, with a loud\\nexclamation, he clasped me in his arms and kissed me warmly.\\n\\n“_mon ami_ hastings!” he cried. “it is indeed _mon ami_ hastings!”\\n\\n“poirot!” i exclaimed.\\n\\ni turned to the pony-trap.\\n\\n“this is a very pleasant meeting for me, miss cynthia. this is my old\\nfriend, monsieur poirot, whom i have not seen for years.”\\n\\n“oh, we know monsieur poirot,” said cynthia gaily. “but i had no idea\\nhe was a friend of yours.”\\n\\n“yes, indeed,” said poirot seriously. “i know mademoiselle cynthia. it\\nis by the charity of that good mrs. inglethorp that i am here.” then,\\nas i looked at him inquiringly: “yes, my friend, she had kindly\\nextended hospitality to seven of my countrypeople who, alas, are\\nrefugees from their native land. we belgians will always remember her\\nwith gratitude.”\\n\\npoirot was an extraordinary looking little man. he was hardly more than\\nfive feet, four inches, but carried himself with great dignity. his\\nhead was exactly the shape of an egg, and he always perched it a little\\non one side. his moustache was very stiff and military. the neatness of\\nhis attire was almost incredible. i believe a speck of dust would have\\ncaused him more pain than a bullet wound. yet this quaint dandified\\nlittle man who, i was sorry to see, now limped badly, had been in his\\ntime one of the most celebrated members of the belgian police. as a\\ndetective, his _flair_ had been extraordinary, and he had achieved\\ntriumphs by unravelling some of the most baffling cases of the day.\\n\\nhe pointed out to me the little house inhabited by him and his fellow\\nbelgians, and i promised to go and see him at an early date. then he\\nraised his hat with a flourish to cynthia, and we drove away.\\n\\n“he’s a dear little man,” said cynthia. “i’d no idea you knew him.”\\n\\n“you’ve been entertaining a celebrity unawares,” i replied.\\n\\nand, for the rest of the way home, i recited to them the various\\nexploits and triumphs of hercule poirot.\\n\\nwe arrived back in a very cheerful mood. as we entered the hall, mrs.\\ninglethorp came out of her boudoir. she looked flushed and upset.\\n\\n“oh, it’s you,” she said.\\n\\n“is there anything the matter, aunt emily?” asked cynthia.\\n\\n“certainly not,” said mrs. inglethorp sharply. “what should there be?”\\nthen catching sight of dorcas, the parlourmaid, going into the\\ndining-room, she called to her to bring some stamps into the boudoir.\\n\\n“yes, m’m.” the old servant hesitated, then added diffidently: “don’t\\nyou think, m’m, you’d better get to bed? you’re looking very tired.”\\n\\n“perhaps you’re right, dorcas—yes—no—not now. i’ve some letters i must\\nfinish by post-time. have you lighted the fire in my room as i told\\nyou?”\\n\\n“yes, m’m.”\\n\\n“then i’ll go to bed directly after supper.”\\n\\nshe went into the boudoir again, and cynthia stared after her.\\n\\n“goodness gracious! i wonder what’s up?” she said to lawrence.\\n\\nhe did not seem to have heard her, for without a word he turned on his\\nheel and went out of the house.\\n\\ni suggested a quick game of tennis before supper and, cynthia agreeing,\\ni ran upstairs to fetch my racquet.\\n\\nmrs. cavendish was coming down the stairs. it may have been my fancy,\\nbut she, too, was looking odd and disturbed.\\n\\n“had a good walk with dr. bauerstein?” i asked, trying to appear as\\nindifferent as i could.\\n\\n“i didn’t go,” she replied abruptly. “where is mrs. inglethorp?”\\n\\n“in the boudoir.”\\n\\nher hand clenched itself on the banisters, then she seemed to nerve\\nherself for some encounter, and went rapidly past me down the stairs\\nacross the hall to the boudoir, the door of which she shut behind her.\\n\\nas i ran out to the tennis court a few moments later, i had to pass the\\nopen boudoir window, and was unable to help overhearing the following\\nscrap of dialogue. mary cavendish was saying in the voice of a woman\\ndesperately controlling herself:\\n\\n“then you won’t show it to me?”\\n\\nto which mrs. inglethorp replied:\\n\\n“my dear mary, it has nothing to do with that matter.”\\n\\n“then show it to me.”\\n\\n“i tell you it is not what you imagine. it does not concern you in the\\nleast.”\\n\\nto which mary cavendish replied, with a rising bitterness:\\n\\n“of course, i might have known you would shield him.”\\n\\ncynthia was waiting for me, and greeted me eagerly with:\\n\\n“i say! there’s been the most awful row! i’ve got it all out of\\ndorcas.”\\n\\n“what kind of a row?”\\n\\n“between aunt emily and _him_. i do hope she’s found him out at last!”\\n\\n“was dorcas there, then?”\\n\\n“of course not. she ‘happened to be near the door’. it was a real old\\nbust-up. i do wish i knew what it was all about.”\\n\\ni thought of mrs. raikes’s gipsy face, and evelyn howard’s warnings,\\nbut wisely decided to hold my peace, whilst cynthia exhausted every\\npossible hypothesis, and cheerfully hoped, “aunt emily will send him\\naway, and will never speak to him again.”\\n\\ni was anxious to get hold of john, but he was nowhere to be seen.\\nevidently something very momentous had occurred that afternoon. i tried\\nto forget the few words i had overheard; but, do what i would, i could\\nnot dismiss them altogether from my mind. what was mary cavendish’s\\nconcern in the matter?\\n\\nmr. inglethorp was in the drawing-room when i came down to supper. his\\nface was impassive as ever, and the strange unreality of the man struck\\nme afresh.\\n\\nmrs. inglethorp came down last. she still looked agitated, and during\\nthe meal there was a somewhat constrained silence. inglethorp was\\nunusually quiet. as a rule, he surrounded his wife with little\\nattentions, placing a cushion at her back, and altogether playing the\\npart of the devoted husband. immediately after supper, mrs. inglethorp\\nretired to her boudoir again.\\n\\n“send my coffee in here, mary,” she called. “i’ve just five minutes to\\ncatch the post.”\\n\\ncynthia and i went and sat by the open window in the drawing-room. mary\\ncavendish brought our coffee to us. she seemed excited.\\n\\n“do you young people want lights, or do you enjoy the twilight?” she\\nasked. “will you take mrs. inglethorp her coffee, cynthia? i will pour\\nit out.”\\n\\n“do not trouble, mary,” said inglethorp. “i will take it to emily.” he\\npoured it out, and went out of the room carrying it carefully.\\n\\nlawrence followed him, and mrs. cavendish sat down by us.\\n\\nwe three sat for some time in silence. it was a glorious night, hot and\\nstill. mrs. cavendish fanned herself gently with a palm leaf.\\n\\n“it’s almost too hot,” she murmured. “we shall have a thunderstorm.”\\n\\nalas, that these harmonious moments can never endure! my paradise was\\nrudely shattered by the sound of a well known, and heartily disliked,\\nvoice in the hall.\\n\\n“dr. bauerstein!” exclaimed cynthia. “what a funny time to come.”\\n\\ni glanced jealously at mary cavendish, but she seemed quite\\nundisturbed, the delicate pallor of her cheeks did not vary.\\n\\nin a few moments, alfred inglethorp had ushered the doctor in, the\\nlatter laughing, and protesting that he was in no fit state for a\\ndrawing-room. in truth, he presented a sorry spectacle, being literally\\nplastered with mud.\\n\\n“what have you been doing, doctor?” cried mrs. cavendish.\\n\\n“i must make my apologies,” said the doctor. “i did not really mean to\\ncome in, but mr. inglethorp insisted.”\\n\\n“well, bauerstein, you are in a plight,” said john, strolling in from\\nthe hall. “have some coffee, and tell us what you have been up to.”\\n\\n“thank you, i will.” he laughed rather ruefully, as he described how he\\nhad discovered a very rare species of fern in an inaccessible place,\\nand in his efforts to obtain it had lost his footing, and slipped\\nignominiously into a neighbouring pond.\\n\\n“the sun soon dried me off,” he added, “but i’m afraid my appearance is\\nvery disreputable.”\\n\\nat this juncture, mrs. inglethorp called to cynthia from the hall, and\\nthe girl ran out.\\n\\n“just carry up my despatch-case, will you, dear? i’m going to bed.”\\n\\nthe door into the hall was a wide one. i had risen when cynthia did,\\njohn was close by me. there were therefore three witnesses who could\\nswear that mrs. inglethorp was carrying her coffee, as yet untasted, in\\nher hand.\\n\\nmy evening was utterly and entirely spoilt by the presence of dr.\\nbauerstein. it seemed to me the man would never go. he rose at last,\\nhowever, and i breathed a sigh of relief.\\n\\n“i’ll walk down to the village with you,” said mr. inglethorp. “i must\\nsee our agent over those estate accounts.” he turned to john. “no one\\nneed sit up. i will take the latch-key.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter iii.\\nthe night of the tragedy\\n\\n\\nto make this part of my story clear, i append the following plan of the\\nfirst floor of styles. the servants’ rooms are reached through the door\\nb. they have no communication with the right wing, where the\\ninglethorps’ rooms were situated.\\n\\n[illustration]\\n\\nit seemed to be the middle of the night when i was awakened by lawrence\\ncavendish. he had a candle in his hand, and the agitation of his face\\ntold me at once that something was seriously wrong.\\n\\n“what’s the matter?” i asked, sitting up in bed, and trying to collect\\nmy scattered thoughts.\\n\\n“we are afraid my mother is very ill. she seems to be having some kind\\nof fit. unfortunately she has locked herself in.”\\n\\n“i’ll come at once.”\\n\\ni sprang out of bed; and, pulling on a dressing-gown, followed lawrence\\nalong the passage and the gallery to the right wing of the house.\\n\\njohn cavendish joined us, and one or two of the servants were standing\\nround in a state of awe-stricken excitement. lawrence turned to his\\nbrother.\\n\\n“what do you think we had better do?”\\n\\nnever, i thought, had his indecision of character been more apparent.\\n\\njohn rattled the handle of mrs. inglethorp’s door violently, but with\\nno effect. it was obviously locked or bolted on the inside. the whole\\nhousehold was aroused by now. the most alarming sounds were audible\\nfrom the interior of the room. clearly something must be done.\\n\\n“try going through mr. inglethorp’s room, sir,” cried dorcas. “oh, the\\npoor mistress!”\\n\\nsuddenly i realized that alfred inglethorp was not with us—that he\\nalone had given no sign of his presence. john opened the door of his\\nroom. it was pitch dark, but lawrence was following with the candle,\\nand by its feeble light we saw that the bed had not been slept in, and\\nthat there was no sign of the room having been occupied.\\n\\nwe went straight to the connecting door. that, too, was locked or\\nbolted on the inside. what was to be done?\\n\\n“oh, dear, sir,” cried dorcas, wringing her hands, “what ever shall we\\ndo?”\\n\\n“we must try and break the door in, i suppose. it’ll be a tough job,\\nthough. here, let one of the maids go down and wake baily and tell him\\nto go for dr. wilkins at once. now then, we’ll have a try at the door.\\nhalf a moment, though, isn’t there a door into miss cynthia’s rooms?”\\n\\n“yes, sir, but that’s always bolted. it’s never been undone.”\\n\\n“well, we might just see.”\\n\\nhe ran rapidly down the corridor to cynthia’s room. mary cavendish was\\nthere, shaking the girl—who must have been an unusually sound\\nsleeper—and trying to wake her.\\n\\nin a moment or two he was back.\\n\\n“no good. that’s bolted too. we must break in the door. i think this\\none is a shade less solid than the one in the passage.”\\n\\nwe strained and heaved together. the framework of the door was solid,\\nand for a long time it resisted our efforts, but at last we felt it\\ngive beneath our weight, and finally, with a resounding crash, it was\\nburst open.\\n\\nwe stumbled in together, lawrence still holding his candle. mrs.\\ninglethorp was lying on the bed, her whole form agitated by violent\\nconvulsions, in one of which she must have overturned the table beside\\nher. as we entered, however, her limbs relaxed, and she fell back upon\\nthe pillows.\\n\\njohn strode across the room, and lit the gas. turning to annie, one of\\nthe housemaids, he sent her downstairs to the dining-room for brandy.\\nthen he went across to his mother whilst i unbolted the door that gave\\non the corridor.\\n\\ni turned to lawrence, to suggest that i had better leave them now that\\nthere was no further need of my services, but the words were frozen on\\nmy lips. never have i seen such a ghastly look on any man’s face. he\\nwas white as chalk, the candle he held in his shaking hand was\\nsputtering onto the carpet, and his eyes, petrified with terror, or\\nsome such kindred emotion, stared fixedly over my head at a point on\\nthe further wall. it was as though he had seen something that turned\\nhim to stone. i instinctively followed the direction of his eyes, but i\\ncould see nothing unusual. the still feebly flickering ashes in the\\ngrate, and the row of prim ornaments on the mantelpiece, were surely\\nharmless enough.\\n\\nthe violence of mrs. inglethorp’s attack seemed to be passing. she was\\nable to speak in short gasps.\\n\\n“better now—very sudden—stupid of me—to lock myself in.”\\n\\na shadow fell on the bed and, looking up, i saw mary cavendish standing\\nnear the door with her arm around cynthia. she seemed to be supporting\\nthe girl, who looked utterly dazed and unlike herself. her face was\\nheavily flushed, and she yawned repeatedly.\\n\\n“poor cynthia is quite frightened,” said mrs. cavendish in a low clear\\nvoice. she herself, i noticed, was dressed in her white land smock.\\nthen it must be later than i thought. i saw that a faint streak of\\ndaylight was showing through the curtains of the windows, and that the\\nclock on the mantelpiece pointed to close upon five o’clock.\\n\\na strangled cry from the bed startled me. a fresh access of pain seized\\nthe unfortunate old lady. the convulsions were of a violence terrible\\nto behold. everything was confusion. we thronged round her, powerless\\nto help or alleviate. a final convulsion lifted her from the bed, until\\nshe appeared to rest upon her head and her heels, with her body arched\\nin an extraordinary manner. in vain mary and john tried to administer\\nmore brandy. the moments flew. again the body arched itself in that\\npeculiar fashion.\\n\\nat that moment, dr. bauerstein pushed his way authoritatively into the\\nroom. for one instant he stopped dead, staring at the figure on the\\nbed, and, at the same instant, mrs. inglethorp cried out in a strangled\\nvoice, her eyes fixed on the doctor:\\n\\n“alfred—alfred——” then she fell back motionless on the pillows.\\n\\nwith a stride, the doctor reached the bed, and seizing her arms worked\\nthem energetically, applying what i knew to be artificial respiration.\\nhe issued a few short sharp orders to the servants. an imperious wave\\nof his hand drove us all to the door. we watched him, fascinated,\\nthough i think we all knew in our hearts that it was too late, and that\\nnothing could be done now. i could see by the expression on his face\\nthat he himself had little hope.\\n\\nfinally he abandoned his task, shaking his head gravely. at that\\nmoment, we heard footsteps outside, and dr. wilkins, mrs. inglethorp’s\\nown doctor, a portly, fussy little man, came bustling in.\\n\\nin a few words dr. bauerstein explained how he had happened to be\\npassing the lodge gates as the car came out, and had run up to the\\nhouse as fast as he could, whilst the car went on to fetch dr. wilkins.\\nwith a faint gesture of the hand, he indicated the figure on the bed.\\n\\n“ve—ry sad. ve—ry sad,” murmured dr. wilkins. “poor dear lady. always\\ndid far too much—far too much—against my advice. i warned her. her\\nheart was far from strong. ‘take it easy,’ i said to her,\\n‘take—it—easy’. but no—her zeal for good works was too great. nature\\nrebelled. na—ture—re—belled.”\\n\\ndr. bauerstein, i noticed, was watching the local doctor narrowly. he\\nstill kept his eyes fixed on him as he spoke.\\n\\n“the convulsions were of a peculiar violence, dr. wilkins. i am sorry\\nyou were not here in time to witness them. they were quite—tetanic in\\ncharacter.”\\n\\n“ah!” said dr. wilkins wisely.\\n\\n“i should like to speak to you in private,” said dr. bauerstein. he\\nturned to john. “you do not object?”\\n\\n“certainly not.”\\n\\nwe all trooped out into the corridor, leaving the two doctors alone,\\nand i heard the key turned in the lock behind us.\\n\\nwe went slowly down the stairs. i was violently excited. i have a\\ncertain talent for deduction, and dr. bauerstein’s manner had started a\\nflock of wild surmises in my mind. mary cavendish laid her hand upon my\\narm.\\n\\n“what is it? why did dr. bauerstein seem so—peculiar?”\\n\\ni looked at her.\\n\\n“do you know what i think?”\\n\\n“what?”\\n\\n“listen!” i looked round, the others were out of earshot. i lowered my\\nvoice to a whisper. “i believe she has been poisoned! i’m certain dr.\\nbauerstein suspects it.”\\n\\n“_what?_” she shrank against the wall, the pupils of her eyes dilating\\nwildly. then, with a sudden cry that startled me, she cried out: “no,\\nno—not that—not that!” and breaking from me, fled up the stairs. i\\nfollowed her, afraid that she was going to faint. i found her leaning\\nagainst the bannisters, deadly pale. she waved me away impatiently.\\n\\n“no, no—leave me. i’d rather be alone. let me just be quiet for a\\nminute or two. go down to the others.”\\n\\ni obeyed her reluctantly. john and lawrence were in the dining-room. i\\njoined them. we were all silent, but i suppose i voiced the thoughts of\\nus all when i at last broke it by saying:\\n\\n“where is mr. inglethorp?”\\n\\njohn shook his head.\\n\\n“he’s not in the house.”\\n\\nour eyes met. where _was_ alfred inglethorp? his absence was strange\\nand inexplicable. i remembered mrs. inglethorp’s dying words. what lay\\nbeneath them? what more could she have told us, if she had had time?\\n\\nat last we heard the doctors descending the stairs. dr. wilkins was\\nlooking important and excited, and trying to conceal an inward\\nexultation under a manner of decorous calm. dr. bauerstein remained in\\nthe background, his grave bearded face unchanged. dr. wilkins was the\\nspokesman for the two. he addressed himself to john:\\n\\n“mr. cavendish, i should like your consent to a post-mortem.”\\n\\n“is that necessary?” asked john gravely. a spasm of pain crossed his\\nface.\\n\\n“absolutely,” said dr. bauerstein.\\n\\n“you mean by that——?”\\n\\n“that neither dr. wilkins nor myself could give a death certificate\\nunder the circumstances.”\\n\\njohn bent his head.\\n\\n“in that case, i have no alternative but to agree.”\\n\\n“thank you,” said dr. wilkins briskly. “we propose that it should take\\nplace to-morrow night—or rather to-night.” and he glanced at the\\ndaylight. “under the circumstances, i am afraid an inquest can hardly\\nbe avoided—these formalities are necessary, but i beg that you won’t\\ndistress yourselves.”\\n\\nthere was a pause, and then dr. bauerstein drew two keys from his\\npocket, and handed them to john.\\n\\n“these are the keys of the two rooms. i have locked them and, in my\\nopinion, they would be better kept locked for the present.”\\n\\nthe doctors then departed.\\n\\ni had been turning over an idea in my head, and i felt that the moment\\nhad now come to broach it. yet i was a little chary of doing so. john,\\ni knew, had a horror of any kind of publicity, and was an easygoing\\noptimist, who preferred never to meet trouble half-way. it might be\\ndifficult to convince him of the soundness of my plan. lawrence, on the\\nother hand, being less conventional, and having more imagination, i\\nfelt i might count upon as an ally. there was no doubt that the moment\\nhad come for me to take the lead.\\n\\n“john,” i said, “i am going to ask you something.”\\n\\n“well?”\\n\\n“you remember my speaking of my friend poirot? the belgian who is here?\\nhe has been a most famous detective.”\\n\\n“yes.”\\n\\n“i want you to let me call him in—to investigate this matter.”\\n\\n“what—now? before the post-mortem?”\\n\\n“yes, time is an advantage if—if—there has been foul play.”\\n\\n“rubbish!” cried lawrence angrily. “in my opinion the whole thing is a\\nmare’s nest of bauerstein’s! wilkins hadn’t an idea of such a thing,\\nuntil bauerstein put it into his head. but, like all specialists,\\nbauerstein’s got a bee in his bonnet. poisons are his hobby, so of\\ncourse he sees them everywhere.”\\n\\ni confess that i was surprised by lawrence’s attitude. he was so seldom\\nvehement about anything.\\n\\njohn hesitated.\\n\\n“i can’t feel as you do, lawrence,” he said at last. “i’m inclined to\\ngive hastings a free hand, though i should prefer to wait a bit. we\\ndon’t want any unnecessary scandal.”\\n\\n“no, no,” i cried eagerly, “you need have no fear of that. poirot is\\ndiscretion itself.”\\n\\n“very well, then, have it your own way. i leave it in your hands.\\nthough, if it is as we suspect, it seems a clear enough case. god\\nforgive me if i am wronging him!”\\n\\ni looked at my watch. it was six o’clock. i determined to lose no time.\\n\\nfive minutes’ delay, however, i allowed myself. i spent it in\\nransacking the library until i discovered a medical book which gave a\\ndescription of strychnine poisoning.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter iv.\\npoirot investigates\\n\\n\\nthe house which the belgians occupied in the village was quite close to\\nthe park gates. one could save time by taking a narrow path through the\\nlong grass, which cut off the detours of the winding drive. so i,\\naccordingly, went that way. i had nearly reached the lodge, when my\\nattention was arrested by the running figure of a man approaching me.\\nit was mr. inglethorp. where had he been? how did he intend to explain\\nhis absence?\\n\\nhe accosted me eagerly.\\n\\n“my god! this is terrible! my poor wife! i have only just heard.”\\n\\n“where have you been?” i asked.\\n\\n“denby kept me late last night. it was one o’clock before we’d\\nfinished. then i found that i’d forgotten the latch-key after all. i\\ndidn’t want to arouse the household, so denby gave me a bed.”\\n\\n“how did you hear the news?” i asked.\\n\\n“wilkins knocked denby up to tell him. my poor emily! she was so\\nself-sacrificing—such a noble character. she over-taxed her strength.”\\n\\na wave of revulsion swept over me. what a consummate hypocrite the man\\nwas!\\n\\n“i must hurry on,” i said, thankful that he did not ask me whither i\\nwas bound.\\n\\nin a few minutes i was knocking at the door of leastways cottage.\\n\\ngetting no answer, i repeated my summons impatiently. a window above me\\nwas cautiously opened, and poirot himself looked out.\\n\\nhe gave an exclamation of surprise at seeing me. in a few brief words,\\ni explained the tragedy that had occurred, and that i wanted his help.\\n\\n“wait, my friend, i will let you in, and you shall recount to me the\\naffair whilst i dress.”\\n\\nin a few moments he had unbarred the door, and i followed him up to his\\nroom. there he installed me in a chair, and i related the whole story,\\nkeeping back nothing, and omitting no circumstance, however\\ninsignificant, whilst he himself made a careful and deliberate toilet.\\n\\ni told him of my awakening, of mrs. inglethorp’s dying words, of her\\nhusband’s absence, of the quarrel the day before, of the scrap of\\nconversation between mary and her mother-in-law that i had overheard,\\nof the former quarrel between mrs. inglethorp and evelyn howard, and of\\nthe latter’s innuendoes.\\n\\ni was hardly as clear as i could wish. i repeated myself several times,\\nand occasionally had to go back to some detail that i had forgotten.\\npoirot smiled kindly on me.\\n\\n“the mind is confused? is it not so? take time, _mon ami_. you are\\nagitated; you are excited—it is but natural. presently, when we are\\ncalmer, we will arrange the facts, neatly, each in his proper place. we\\nwill examine—and reject. those of importance we will put on one side;\\nthose of no importance, pouf!”—he screwed up his cherub-like face, and\\npuffed comically enough—“blow them away!”\\n\\n“that’s all very well,” i objected, “but how are you going to decide\\nwhat is important, and what isn’t? that always seems the difficulty to\\nme.”\\n\\npoirot shook his head energetically. he was now arranging his moustache\\nwith exquisite care.\\n\\n“not so. _voyons!_ one fact leads to another—so we continue. does the\\nnext fit in with that? _a merveille!_ good! we can proceed. this next\\nlittle fact—no! ah, that is curious! there is something missing—a link\\nin the chain that is not there. we examine. we search. and that little\\ncurious fact, that possibly paltry little detail that will not tally,\\nwe put it here!” he made an extravagant gesture with his hand. “it is\\nsignificant! it is tremendous!”\\n\\n“y—es——”\\n\\n“ah!” poirot shook his forefinger so fiercely at me that i quailed\\nbefore it. “beware! peril to the detective who says: ‘it is so small—it\\ndoes not matter. it will not agree. i will forget it.’ that way lies\\nconfusion! everything matters.”\\n\\n“i know. you always told me that. that’s why i have gone into all the\\ndetails of this thing whether they seemed to me relevant or not.”\\n\\n“and i am pleased with you. you have a good memory, and you have given\\nme the facts faithfully. of the order in which you present them, i say\\nnothing—truly, it is deplorable! but i make allowances—you are upset.\\nto that i attribute the circumstance that you have omitted one fact of\\nparamount importance.”\\n\\n“what is that?” i asked.\\n\\n“you have not told me if mrs. inglethorp ate well last night.”\\n\\ni stared at him. surely the war had affected the little man’s brain. he\\nwas carefully engaged in brushing his coat before putting it on, and\\nseemed wholly engrossed in the task.\\n\\n“i don’t remember,” i said. “and, anyway, i don’t see——”\\n\\n“you do not see? but it is of the first importance.”\\n\\n“i can’t see why,” i said, rather nettled. “as far as i can remember,\\nshe didn’t eat much. she was obviously upset, and it had taken her\\nappetite away. that was only natural.”\\n\\n“yes,” said poirot thoughtfully, “it was only natural.”\\n\\nhe opened a drawer, and took out a small despatch-case, then turned to\\nme.\\n\\n“now i am ready. we will proceed to the château, and study matters on\\nthe spot. excuse me, _mon ami_, you dressed in haste, and your tie is\\non one side. permit me.” with a deft gesture, he rearranged it.\\n\\n“_ça y est!_ now, shall we start?”\\n\\nwe hurried up the village, and turned in at the lodge gates. poirot\\nstopped for a moment, and gazed sorrowfully over the beautiful expanse\\nof park, still glittering with morning dew.\\n\\n“so beautiful, so beautiful, and yet, the poor family, plunged in\\nsorrow, prostrated with grief.”\\n\\nhe looked at me keenly as he spoke, and i was aware that i reddened\\nunder his prolonged gaze.\\n\\nwas the family prostrated by grief? was the sorrow at mrs. inglethorp’s\\ndeath so great? i realized that there was an emotional lack in the\\natmosphere. the dead woman had not the gift of commanding love. her\\ndeath was a shock and a distress, but she would not be passionately\\nregretted.\\n\\npoirot seemed to follow my thoughts. he nodded his head gravely.\\n\\n“no, you are right,” he said, “it is not as though there was a blood\\ntie. she has been kind and generous to these cavendishes, but she was\\nnot their own mother. blood tells—always remember that—blood tells.”\\n\\n“poirot,” i said, “i wish you would tell me why you wanted to know if\\nmrs. inglethorp ate well last night? i have been turning it over in my\\nmind, but i can’t see how it has anything to do with the matter?”\\n\\nhe was silent for a minute or two as we walked along, but finally he\\nsaid:\\n\\n“i do not mind telling you—though, as you know, it is not my habit to\\nexplain until the end is reached. the present contention is that mrs.\\ninglethorp died of strychnine poisoning, presumably administered in her\\ncoffee.”\\n\\n“yes?”\\n\\n“well, what time was the coffee served?”\\n\\n“about eight o’clock.”\\n\\n“therefore she drank it between then and half-past eight—certainly not\\nmuch later. well, strychnine is a fairly rapid poison. its effects\\nwould be felt very soon, probably in about an hour. yet, in mrs.\\ninglethorp’s case, the symptoms do not manifest themselves until five\\no’clock the next morning: nine hours! but a heavy meal, taken at about\\nthe same time as the poison, might retard its effects, though hardly to\\nthat extent. still, it is a possibility to be taken into account. but,\\naccording to you, she ate very little for supper, and yet the symptoms\\ndo not develop until early the next morning! now that is a curious\\ncircumstance, my friend. something may arise at the autopsy to explain\\nit. in the meantime, remember it.”\\n\\nas we neared the house, john came out and met us. his face looked weary\\nand haggard.\\n\\n“this is a very dreadful business, monsieur poirot,” he said. “hastings\\nhas explained to you that we are anxious for no publicity?”\\n\\n“i comprehend perfectly.”\\n\\n“you see, it is only suspicion so far. we have nothing to go upon.”\\n\\n“precisely. it is a matter of precaution only.”\\n\\njohn turned to me, taking out his cigarette-case, and lighting a\\ncigarette as he did so.\\n\\n“you know that fellow inglethorp is back?”\\n\\n“yes. i met him.”\\n\\njohn flung the match into an adjacent flower bed, a proceeding which\\nwas too much for poirot’s feelings. he retrieved it, and buried it\\nneatly.\\n\\n“it’s jolly difficult to know how to treat him.”\\n\\n“that difficulty will not exist long,” pronounced poirot quietly.\\n\\njohn looked puzzled, not quite understanding the portent of this\\ncryptic saying. he handed the two keys which dr. bauerstein had given\\nhim to me.\\n\\n“show monsieur poirot everything he wants to see.”\\n\\n“the rooms are locked?” asked poirot.\\n\\n“dr. bauerstein considered it advisable.”\\n\\npoirot nodded thoughtfully.\\n\\n“then he is very sure. well, that simplifies matters for us.”\\n\\nwe went up together to the room of the tragedy. for convenience i\\nappend a plan of the room and the principal articles of furniture in\\nit.\\n\\n[illustration]\\n\\npoirot locked the door on the inside, and proceeded to a minute\\ninspection of the room. he darted from one object to the other with the\\nagility of a grasshopper. i remained by the door, fearing to obliterate\\nany clues. poirot, however, did not seem grateful to me for my\\nforbearance.\\n\\n“what have you, my friend,” he cried, “that you remain there like—how\\ndo you say it?—ah, yes, the stuck pig?”\\n\\ni explained that i was afraid of obliterating any foot-marks.\\n\\n“foot-marks? but what an idea! there has already been practically an\\narmy in the room! what foot-marks are we likely to find? no, come here\\nand aid me in my search. i will put down my little case until i need\\nit.”\\n\\nhe did so, on the round table by the window, but it was an ill-advised\\nproceeding; for, the top of it being loose, it tilted up, and\\nprecipitated the despatch-case on the floor.\\n\\n“_eh voilà une table!_” cried poirot. “ah, my friend, one may live in a\\nbig house and yet have no comfort.”\\n\\nafter which piece of moralizing, he resumed his search.\\n\\na small purple despatch-case, with a key in the lock, on the\\nwriting-table, engaged his attention for some time. he took out the key\\nfrom the lock, and passed it to me to inspect. i saw nothing peculiar,\\nhowever. it was an ordinary key of the yale type, with a bit of twisted\\nwire through the handle.\\n\\nnext, he examined the framework of the door we had broken in, assuring\\nhimself that the bolt had really been shot. then he went to the door\\nopposite leading into cynthia’s room. that door was also bolted, as i\\nhad stated. however, he went to the length of unbolting it, and opening\\nand shutting it several times; this he did with the utmost precaution\\nagainst making any noise. suddenly something in the bolt itself seemed\\nto rivet his attention. he examined it carefully, and then, nimbly\\nwhipping out a pair of small forceps from his case, he drew out some\\nminute particle which he carefully sealed up in a tiny envelope.\\n\\non the chest of drawers there was a tray with a spirit lamp and a small\\nsaucepan on it. a small quantity of a dark fluid remained in the\\nsaucepan, and an empty cup and saucer that had been drunk out of stood\\nnear it.\\n\\ni wondered how i could have been so unobservant as to overlook this.\\nhere was a clue worth having. poirot delicately dipped his finger into\\nliquid, and tasted it gingerly. he made a grimace.\\n\\n“cocoa—with—i think—rum in it.”\\n\\nhe passed on to the debris on the floor, where the table by the bed had\\nbeen overturned. a reading-lamp, some books, matches, a bunch of keys,\\nand the crushed fragments of a coffee-cup lay scattered about.\\n\\n“ah, this is curious,” said poirot.\\n\\n“i must confess that i see nothing particularly curious about it.”\\n\\n“you do not? observe the lamp—the chimney is broken in two places; they\\nlie there as they fell. but see, the coffee-cup is absolutely smashed\\nto powder.”\\n\\n“well,” i said wearily, “i suppose someone must have stepped on it.”\\n\\n“exactly,” said poirot, in an odd voice. “someone stepped on it.”\\n\\nhe rose from his knees, and walked slowly across to the mantelpiece,\\nwhere he stood abstractedly fingering the ornaments, and straightening\\nthem—a trick of his when he was agitated.\\n\\n“_mon ami_,” he said, turning to me, “somebody stepped on that cup,\\ngrinding it to powder, and the reason they did so was either because it\\ncontained strychnine or—which is far more serious—because it did not\\ncontain strychnine!”\\n\\ni made no reply. i was bewildered, but i knew that it was no good\\nasking him to explain. in a moment or two he roused himself, and went\\non with his investigations. he picked up the bunch of keys from the\\nfloor, and twirling them round in his fingers finally selected one,\\nvery bright and shining, which he tried in the lock of the purple\\ndespatch-case. it fitted, and he opened the box, but after a moment’s\\nhesitation, closed and relocked it, and slipped the bunch of keys, as\\nwell as the key that had originally stood in the lock, into his own\\npocket.\\n\\n“i have no authority to go through these papers. but it should be\\ndone—at once!”\\n\\nhe then made a very careful examination of the drawers of the\\nwash-stand. crossing the room to the left-hand window, a round stain,\\nhardly visible on the dark brown carpet, seemed to interest him\\nparticularly. he went down on his knees, examining it minutely—even\\ngoing so far as to smell it.\\n\\nfinally, he poured a few drops of the cocoa into a test tube, sealing\\nit up carefully. his next proceeding was to take out a little notebook.\\n\\n“we have found in this room,” he said, writing busily, “six points of\\ninterest. shall i enumerate them, or will you?”\\n\\n“oh, you,” i replied hastily.\\n\\n“very well, then. one, a coffee-cup that has been ground into powder;\\ntwo, a despatch-case with a key in the lock; three, a stain on the\\nfloor.”\\n\\n“that may have been done some time ago,” i interrupted.\\n\\n“no, for it is still perceptibly damp and smells of coffee. four, a\\nfragment of some dark green fabric—only a thread or two, but\\nrecognizable.”\\n\\n“ah!” i cried. “that was what you sealed up in the envelope.”\\n\\n“yes. it may turn out to be a piece of one of mrs. inglethorp’s own\\ndresses, and quite unimportant. we shall see. five, _this_!” with a\\ndramatic gesture, he pointed to a large splash of candle grease on the\\nfloor by the writing-table. “it must have been done since yesterday,\\notherwise a good housemaid would have at once removed it with\\nblotting-paper and a hot iron. one of my best hats once—but that is not\\nto the point.”\\n\\n“it was very likely done last night. we were very agitated. or perhaps\\nmrs. inglethorp herself dropped her candle.”\\n\\n“you brought only one candle into the room?”\\n\\n“yes. lawrence cavendish was carrying it. but he was very upset. he\\nseemed to see something over here”—i indicated the mantelpiece—“that\\nabsolutely paralysed him.”\\n\\n“that is interesting,” said poirot quickly. “yes, it is suggestive”—his\\neye sweeping the whole length of the wall—“but it was not his candle\\nthat made this great patch, for you perceive that this is white grease;\\nwhereas monsieur lawrence’s candle, which is still on the\\ndressing-table, is pink. on the other hand, mrs. inglethorp had no\\ncandlestick in the room, only a reading-lamp.”\\n\\n“then,” i said, “what do you deduce?”\\n\\nto which my friend only made a rather irritating reply, urging me to\\nuse my own natural faculties.\\n\\n“and the sixth point?” i asked. “i suppose it is the sample of cocoa.”\\n\\n“no,” said poirot thoughtfully. “i might have included that in the six,\\nbut i did not. no, the sixth point i will keep to myself for the\\npresent.”\\n\\nhe looked quickly round the room. “there is nothing more to be done\\nhere, i think, unless”—he stared earnestly and long at the dead ashes\\nin the grate. “the fire burns—and it destroys. but by chance—there\\nmight be—let us see!”\\n\\ndeftly, on hands and knees, he began to sort the ashes from the grate\\ninto the fender, handling them with the greatest caution. suddenly, he\\ngave a faint exclamation.\\n\\n“the forceps, hastings!”\\n\\ni quickly handed them to him, and with skill he extracted a small piece\\nof half charred paper.\\n\\n“there, _mon ami!_” he cried. “what do you think of that?”\\n\\ni scrutinized the fragment. this is an exact reproduction of it:—\\n\\n[illustration]\\n\\ni was puzzled. it was unusually thick, quite unlike ordinary notepaper.\\nsuddenly an idea struck me.\\n\\n“poirot!” i cried. “this is a fragment of a will!”\\n\\n“exactly.”\\n\\ni looked up at him sharply.\\n\\n“you are not surprised?”\\n\\n“no,” he said gravely, “i expected it.”\\n\\ni relinquished the piece of paper, and watched him put it away in his\\ncase, with the same methodical care that he bestowed on everything. my\\nbrain was in a whirl. what was this complication of a will? who had\\ndestroyed it? the person who had left the candle grease on the floor?\\nobviously. but how had anyone gained admission? all the doors had been\\nbolted on the inside.\\n\\n“now, my friend,” said poirot briskly, “we will go. i should like to\\nask a few questions of the parlourmaid—dorcas, her name is, is it not?”\\n\\nwe passed through alfred inglethorp’s room, and poirot delayed long\\nenough to make a brief but fairly comprehensive examination of it. we\\nwent out through that door, locking both it and that of mrs.\\ninglethorp’s room as before.\\n\\ni took him down to the boudoir which he had expressed a wish to see,\\nand went myself in search of dorcas.\\n\\nwhen i returned with her, however, the boudoir was empty.\\n\\n“poirot,” i cried, “where are you?”\\n\\n“i am here, my friend.”\\n\\nhe had stepped outside the french window, and was standing, apparently\\nlost in admiration, before the various shaped flower beds.\\n\\n“admirable!” he murmured. “admirable! what symmetry! observe that\\ncrescent; and those diamonds—their neatness rejoices the eye. the\\nspacing of the plants, also, is perfect. it has been recently done; is\\nit not so?”\\n\\n“yes, i believe they were at it yesterday afternoon. but come in—dorcas\\nis here.”\\n\\n“_eh bien, eh bien!_ do not grudge me a moment’s satisfaction of the\\neye.”\\n\\n“yes, but this affair is more important.”\\n\\n“and how do you know that these fine begonias are not of equal\\nimportance?”\\n\\ni shrugged my shoulders. there was really no arguing with him if he\\nchose to take that line.\\n\\n“you do not agree? but such things have been. well, we will come in and\\ninterview the brave dorcas.”\\n\\ndorcas was standing in the boudoir, her hands folded in front of her,\\nand her grey hair rose in stiff waves under her white cap. she was the\\nvery model and picture of a good old-fashioned servant.\\n\\nin her attitude towards poirot, she was inclined to be suspicious, but\\nhe soon broke down her defences. he drew forward a chair.\\n\\n“pray be seated, mademoiselle.”\\n\\n“thank you, sir.”\\n\\n“you have been with your mistress many years, is it not so?”\\n\\n“ten years, sir.”\\n\\n“that is a long time, and very faithful service. you were much attached\\nto her, were you not?”\\n\\n“she was a very good mistress to me, sir.”\\n\\n“then you will not object to answering a few questions. i put them to\\nyou with mr. cavendish’s full approval.”\\n\\n“oh, certainly, sir.”\\n\\n“then i will begin by asking you about the events of yesterday\\nafternoon. your mistress had a quarrel?”\\n\\n“yes, sir. but i don’t know that i ought——” dorcas hesitated.\\n\\npoirot looked at her keenly.\\n\\n“my good dorcas, it is necessary that i should know every detail of\\nthat quarrel as fully as possible. do not think that you are betraying\\nyour mistress’s secrets. your mistress lies dead, and it is necessary\\nthat we should know all—if we are to avenge her. nothing can bring her\\nback to life, but we do hope, if there has been foul play, to bring the\\nmurderer to justice.”\\n\\n“amen to that,” said dorcas fiercely. “and, naming no names, there’s\\n_one_ in this house that none of us could ever abide! and an ill day it\\nwas when first _he_ darkened the threshold.”\\n\\npoirot waited for her indignation to subside, and then, resuming his\\nbusiness-like tone, he asked:\\n\\n“now, as to this quarrel? what is the first you heard of it?”\\n\\n“well, sir, i happened to be going along the hall outside yesterday——”\\n\\n“what time was that?”\\n\\n“i couldn’t say exactly, sir, but it wasn’t tea-time by a long way.\\nperhaps four o’clock—or it may have been a bit later. well, sir, as i\\nsaid, i happened to be passing along, when i heard voices very loud and\\nangry in here. i didn’t exactly mean to listen, but—well, there it is.\\ni stopped. the door was shut, but the mistress was speaking very sharp\\nand clear, and i heard what she said quite plainly. ‘you have lied to\\nme, and deceived me,’ she said. i didn’t hear what mr. inglethorp\\nreplied. he spoke a good bit lower than she did—but she answered: ‘how\\ndare you? i have kept you and clothed you and fed you! you owe\\neverything to me! and this is how you repay me! by bringing disgrace\\nupon our name!’ again i didn’t hear what he said, but she went on:\\n‘nothing that you can say will make any difference. i see my duty\\nclearly. my mind is made up. you need not think that any fear of\\npublicity, or scandal between husband and wife will deter me.’ then i\\nthought i heard them coming out, so i went off quickly.”\\n\\n“you are sure it was mr. inglethorp’s voice you heard?”\\n\\n“oh, yes, sir, whose else’s could it be?”\\n\\n“well, what happened next?”\\n\\n“later, i came back to the hall; but it was all quiet. at five o’clock,\\nmrs. inglethorp rang the bell and told me to bring her a cup of\\ntea—nothing to eat—to the boudoir. she was looking dreadful—so white\\nand upset. ‘dorcas,’ she says, ‘i’ve had a great shock.’ ‘i’m sorry for\\nthat, m’m,’ i says. ‘you’ll feel better after a nice hot cup of tea,\\nm’m.’ she had something in her hand. i don’t know if it was a letter,\\nor just a piece of paper, but it had writing on it, and she kept\\nstaring at it, almost as if she couldn’t believe what was written\\nthere. she whispered to herself, as though she had forgotten i was\\nthere: ‘these few words—and everything’s changed.’ and then she says to\\nme: ‘never trust a man, dorcas, they’re not worth it!’ i hurried off,\\nand got her a good strong cup of tea, and she thanked me, and said\\nshe’d feel better when she’d drunk it. ‘i don’t know what to do,’ she\\nsays. ‘scandal between husband and wife is a dreadful thing, dorcas.\\ni’d rather hush it up if i could.’ mrs. cavendish came in just then, so\\nshe didn’t say any more.”\\n\\n“she still had the letter, or whatever it was, in her hand?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“yes, sir.”\\n\\n“what would she be likely to do with it afterwards?”\\n\\n“well, i don’t know, sir, i expect she would lock it up in that purple\\ncase of hers.”\\n\\n“is that where she usually kept important papers?”\\n\\n“yes, sir. she brought it down with her every morning, and took it up\\nevery night.”\\n\\n“when did she lose the key of it?”\\n\\n“she missed it yesterday at lunch-time, sir, and told me to look\\ncarefully for it. she was very much put out about it.”\\n\\n“but she had a duplicate key?”\\n\\n“oh, yes, sir.”\\n\\ndorcas was looking very curiously at him and, to tell the truth, so was\\ni. what was all this about a lost key? poirot smiled.\\n\\n“never mind, dorcas, it is my business to know things. is this the key\\nthat was lost?” he drew from his pocket the key that he had found in\\nthe lock of the despatch-case upstairs.\\n\\ndorcas’s eyes looked as though they would pop out of her head.\\n\\n“that’s it, sir, right enough. but where did you find it? i looked\\neverywhere for it.”\\n\\n“ah, but you see it was not in the same place yesterday as it was\\nto-day. now, to pass to another subject, had your mistress a dark green\\ndress in her wardrobe?”\\n\\ndorcas was rather startled by the unexpected question.\\n\\n“no, sir.”\\n\\n“are you quite sure?”\\n\\n“oh, yes, sir.”\\n\\n“has anyone else in the house got a green dress?”\\n\\ndorcas reflected.\\n\\n“miss cynthia has a green evening dress.”\\n\\n“light or dark green?”\\n\\n“a light green, sir; a sort of chiffon, they call it.”\\n\\n“ah, that is not what i want. and nobody else has anything green?”\\n\\n“no, sir—not that i know of.”\\n\\npoirot’s face did not betray a trace of whether he was disappointed or\\notherwise. he merely remarked:\\n\\n“good, we will leave that and pass on. have you any reason to believe\\nthat your mistress was likely to take a sleeping powder last night?”\\n\\n“not _last_ night, sir, i know she didn’t.”\\n\\n“why do you know so positively?”\\n\\n“because the box was empty. she took the last one two days ago, and she\\ndidn’t have any more made up.”\\n\\n“you are quite sure of that?”\\n\\n“positive, sir.”\\n\\n“then that is cleared up! by the way, your mistress didn’t ask you to\\nsign any paper yesterday?”\\n\\n“to sign a paper? no, sir.”\\n\\n“when mr. hastings and mr. lawrence came in yesterday evening, they\\nfound your mistress busy writing letters. i suppose you can give me no\\nidea to whom these letters were addressed?”\\n\\n“i’m afraid i couldn’t, sir. i was out in the evening. perhaps annie\\ncould tell you, though she’s a careless girl. never cleared the\\ncoffee-cups away last night. that’s what happens when i’m not here to\\nlook after things.”\\n\\npoirot lifted his hand.\\n\\n“since they have been left, dorcas, leave them a little longer, i pray\\nyou. i should like to examine them.”\\n\\n“very well, sir.”\\n\\n“what time did you go out last evening?”\\n\\n“about six o’clock, sir.”\\n\\n“thank you, dorcas, that is all i have to ask you.” he rose and\\nstrolled to the window. “i have been admiring these flower beds. how\\nmany gardeners are employed here, by the way?”\\n\\n“only three now, sir. five, we had, before the war, when it was kept as\\na gentleman’s place should be. i wish you could have seen it then, sir.\\na fair sight it was. but now there’s only old manning, and young\\nwilliam, and a new-fashioned woman gardener in breeches and such-like.\\nah, these are dreadful times!”\\n\\n“the good times will come again, dorcas. at least, we hope so. now,\\nwill you send annie to me here?”\\n\\n“yes, sir. thank you, sir.”\\n\\n“how did you know that mrs. inglethorp took sleeping powders?” i asked,\\nin lively curiosity, as dorcas left the room. “and about the lost key\\nand the duplicate?”\\n\\n“one thing at a time. as to the sleeping powders, i knew by this.” he\\nsuddenly produced a small cardboard box, such as chemists use for\\npowders.\\n\\n“where did you find it?”\\n\\n“in the wash-stand drawer in mrs. inglethorp’s bedroom. it was number\\nsix of my catalogue.”\\n\\n“but i suppose, as the last powder was taken two days ago, it is not of\\nmuch importance?”\\n\\n“probably not, but do you notice anything that strikes you as peculiar\\nabout this box?”\\n\\ni examined it closely.\\n\\n“no, i can’t say that i do.”\\n\\n“look at the label.”\\n\\ni read the label carefully: “‘one powder to be taken at bedtime, if\\nrequired. mrs. inglethorp.’ no, i see nothing unusual.”\\n\\n“not the fact that there is no chemist’s name?”\\n\\n“ah!” i exclaimed. “to be sure, that is odd!”\\n\\n“have you ever known a chemist to send out a box like that, without his\\nprinted name?”\\n\\n“no, i can’t say that i have.”\\n\\ni was becoming quite excited, but poirot damped my ardour by remarking:\\n\\n“yet the explanation is quite simple. so do not intrigue yourself, my\\nfriend.”\\n\\nan audible creaking proclaimed the approach of annie, so i had no time\\nto reply.\\n\\nannie was a fine, strapping girl, and was evidently labouring under\\nintense excitement, mingled with a certain ghoulish enjoyment of the\\ntragedy.\\n\\npoirot came to the point at once, with a business-like briskness.\\n\\n“i sent for you, annie, because i thought you might be able to tell me\\nsomething about the letters mrs. inglethorp wrote last night. how many\\nwere there? and can you tell me any of the names and addresses?”\\n\\nannie considered.\\n\\n“there were four letters, sir. one was to miss howard, and one was to\\nmr. wells, the lawyer, and the other two i don’t think i remember,\\nsir—oh, yes, one was to ross’s, the caterers in tadminster. the other\\none, i don’t remember.”\\n\\n“think,” urged poirot.\\n\\nannie racked her brains in vain.\\n\\n“i’m sorry, sir, but it’s clean gone. i don’t think i can have noticed\\nit.”\\n\\n“it does not matter,” said poirot, not betraying any sign of\\ndisappointment. “now i want to ask you about something else. there is a\\nsaucepan in mrs. inglethorp’s room with some cocoa in it. did she have\\nthat every night?”\\n\\n“yes, sir, it was put in her room every evening, and she warmed it up\\nin the night—whenever she fancied it.”\\n\\n“what was it? plain cocoa?”\\n\\n“yes, sir, made with milk, with a teaspoonful of sugar, and two\\nteaspoonfuls of rum in it.”\\n\\n“who took it to her room?”\\n\\n“i did, sir.”\\n\\n“always?”\\n\\n“yes, sir.”\\n\\n“at what time?”\\n\\n“when i went to draw the curtains, as a rule, sir.”\\n\\n“did you bring it straight up from the kitchen then?”\\n\\n“no, sir, you see there’s not much room on the gas stove, so cook used\\nto make it early, before putting the vegetables on for supper. then i\\nused to bring it up, and put it on the table by the swing door, and\\ntake it into her room later.”\\n\\n“the swing door is in the left wing, is it not?”\\n\\n“yes, sir.”\\n\\n“and the table, is it on this side of the door, or on the\\nfarther—servants’ side?”\\n\\n“it’s this side, sir.”\\n\\n“what time did you bring it up last night?”\\n\\n“about quarter-past seven, i should say, sir.”\\n\\n“and when did you take it into mrs. inglethorp’s room?”\\n\\n“when i went to shut up, sir. about eight o’clock. mrs. inglethorp came\\nup to bed before i’d finished.”\\n\\n“then, between seven-fifteen and eight o’clock, the cocoa was standing\\non the table in the left wing?”\\n\\n“yes, sir.” annie had been growing redder and redder in the face, and\\nnow she blurted out unexpectedly:\\n\\n“and if there _was_ salt in it, sir, it wasn’t me. i never took the\\nsalt near it.”\\n\\n“what makes you think there was salt in it?” asked poirot.\\n\\n“seeing it on the tray, sir.”\\n\\n“you saw some salt on the tray?”\\n\\n“yes. coarse kitchen salt, it looked. i never noticed it when i took\\nthe tray up, but when i came to take it into the mistress’s room i saw\\nit at once, and i suppose i ought to have taken it down again, and\\nasked cook to make some fresh. but i was in a hurry, because dorcas was\\nout, and i thought maybe the cocoa itself was all right, and the salt\\nhad only gone on the tray. so i dusted it off with my apron, and took\\nit in.”\\n\\ni had the utmost difficulty in controlling my excitement. unknown to\\nherself, annie had provided us with an important piece of evidence. how\\nshe would have gaped if she had realized that her “coarse kitchen salt”\\nwas strychnine, one of the most deadly poisons known to mankind. i\\nmarvelled at poirot’s calm. his self-control was astonishing. i awaited\\nhis next question with impatience, but it disappointed me.\\n\\n“when you went into mrs. inglethorp’s room, was the door leading into\\nmiss cynthia’s room bolted?”\\n\\n“oh! yes, sir; it always was. it had never been opened.”\\n\\n“and the door into mr. inglethorp’s room? did you notice if that was\\nbolted too?”\\n\\nannie hesitated.\\n\\n“i couldn’t rightly say, sir; it was shut but i couldn’t say whether it\\nwas bolted or not.”\\n\\n“when you finally left the room, did mrs. inglethorp bolt the door\\nafter you?”\\n\\n“no, sir, not then, but i expect she did later. she usually did lock it\\nat night. the door into the passage, that is.”\\n\\n“did you notice any candle grease on the floor when you did the room\\nyesterday?”\\n\\n“candle grease? oh, no, sir. mrs. inglethorp didn’t have a candle, only\\na reading-lamp.”\\n\\n“then, if there had been a large patch of candle grease on the floor,\\nyou think you would have been sure to have seen it?”\\n\\n“yes, sir, and i would have taken it out with a piece of blotting-paper\\nand a hot iron.”\\n\\nthen poirot repeated the question he had put to dorcas:\\n\\n“did your mistress ever have a green dress?”\\n\\n“no, sir.”\\n\\n“nor a mantle, nor a cape, nor a—how do you call it?—a sports coat?”\\n\\n“not green, sir.”\\n\\n“nor anyone else in the house?”\\n\\nannie reflected.\\n\\n“no, sir.”\\n\\n“you are sure of that?”\\n\\n“quite sure.”\\n\\n“_bien!_ that is all i want to know. thank you very much.”\\n\\nwith a nervous giggle, annie took herself creakingly out of the room.\\nmy pent-up excitement burst forth.\\n\\n“poirot,” i cried, “i congratulate you! this is a great discovery.”\\n\\n“what is a great discovery?”\\n\\n“why, that it was the cocoa and not the coffee that was poisoned. that\\nexplains everything! of course it did not take effect until the early\\nmorning, since the cocoa was only drunk in the middle of the night.”\\n\\n“so you think that the cocoa—mark well what i say, hastings, the\\n_cocoa_—contained strychnine?”\\n\\n“of course! that salt on the tray, what else could it have been?”\\n\\n“it might have been salt,” replied poirot placidly.\\n\\ni shrugged my shoulders. if he was going to take the matter that way,\\nit was no good arguing with him. the idea crossed my mind, not for the\\nfirst time, that poor old poirot was growing old. privately i thought\\nit lucky that he had associated with him someone of a more receptive\\ntype of mind.\\n\\npoirot was surveying me with quietly twinkling eyes.\\n\\n“you are not pleased with me, _mon ami?_”\\n\\n“my dear poirot,” i said coldly, “it is not for me to dictate to you.\\nyou have a right to your own opinion, just as i have to mine.”\\n\\n“a most admirable sentiment,” remarked poirot, rising briskly to his\\nfeet. “now i have finished with this room. by the way, whose is the\\nsmaller desk in the corner?”\\n\\n“mr. inglethorp’s.”\\n\\n“ah!” he tried the roll top tentatively. “locked. but perhaps one of\\nmrs. inglethorp’s keys would open it.” he tried several, twisting and\\nturning them with a practiced hand, and finally uttering an ejaculation\\nof satisfaction. “_voilà!_ it is not the key, but it will open it at a\\npinch.” he slid back the roll top, and ran a rapid eye over the neatly\\nfiled papers. to my surprise, he did not examine them, merely remarking\\napprovingly as he relocked the desk: “decidedly, he is a man of method,\\nthis mr. inglethorp!”\\n\\na “man of method” was, in poirot’s estimation, the highest praise that\\ncould be bestowed on any individual.\\n\\ni felt that my friend was not what he had been as he rambled on\\ndisconnectedly:\\n\\n“there were no stamps in his desk, but there might have been, eh, _mon\\nami?_ there might have been? yes”—his eyes wandered round the\\nroom—“this boudoir has nothing more to tell us. it did not yield much.\\nonly this.”\\n\\nhe pulled a crumpled envelope out of his pocket, and tossed it over to\\nme. it was rather a curious document. a plain, dirty looking old\\nenvelope with a few words scrawled across it, apparently at random. the\\nfollowing is a facsimile of it.\\n\\n[illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter v.\\n“it isn’t strychnine, is it?”\\n\\n\\n“where did you find this?” i asked poirot, in lively curiosity.\\n\\n“in the waste-paper basket. you recognise the handwriting?”\\n\\n“yes, it is mrs. inglethorp’s. but what does it mean?”\\n\\npoirot shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n“i cannot say—but it is suggestive.”\\n\\na wild idea flashed across me. was it possible that mrs. inglethorp’s\\nmind was deranged? had she some fantastic idea of demoniacal\\npossession? and, if that were so, was it not also possible that she\\nmight have taken her own life?\\n\\ni was about to expound these theories to poirot, when his own words\\ndistracted me.\\n\\n“come,” he said, “now to examine the coffee-cups!”\\n\\n“my dear poirot! what on earth is the good of that, now that we know\\nabout the cocoa?”\\n\\n“oh, _là là!_ that miserable cocoa!” cried poirot flippantly.\\n\\nhe laughed with apparent enjoyment, raising his arms to heaven in mock\\ndespair, in what i could not but consider the worst possible taste.\\n\\n“and, anyway,” i said, with increasing coldness, “as mrs. inglethorp\\ntook her coffee upstairs with her, i do not see what you expect to\\nfind, unless you consider it likely that we shall discover a packet of\\nstrychnine on the coffee tray!”\\n\\npoirot was sobered at once.\\n\\n“come, come, my friend,” he said, slipping his arms through mine. “_ne\\nvous fâchez pas!_ allow me to interest myself in my coffee-cups, and i\\nwill respect your cocoa. there! is it a bargain?”\\n\\nhe was so quaintly humorous that i was forced to laugh; and we went\\ntogether to the drawing-room, where the coffee-cups and tray remained\\nundisturbed as we had left them.\\n\\npoirot made me recapitulate the scene of the night before, listening\\nvery carefully, and verifying the position of the various cups.\\n\\n“so mrs. cavendish stood by the tray—and poured out. yes. then she came\\nacross to the window where you sat with mademoiselle cynthia. yes. here\\nare the three cups. and the cup on the mantelpiece, half drunk, that\\nwould be mr. lawrence cavendish’s. and the one on the tray?”\\n\\n“john cavendish’s. i saw him put it down there.”\\n\\n“good. one, two, three, four, five—but where, then, is the cup of mr.\\ninglethorp?”\\n\\n“he does not take coffee.”\\n\\n“then all are accounted for. one moment, my friend.”\\n\\nwith infinite care, he took a drop or two from the grounds in each cup,\\nsealing them up in separate test tubes, tasting each in turn as he did\\nso. his physiognomy underwent a curious change. an expression gathered\\nthere that i can only describe as half puzzled, and half relieved.\\n\\n“_bien!_” he said at last. “it is evident! i had an idea—but clearly i\\nwas mistaken. yes, altogether i was mistaken. yet it is strange. but no\\nmatter!”\\n\\nand, with a characteristic shrug, he dismissed whatever it was that was\\nworrying him from his mind. i could have told him from the beginning\\nthat this obsession of his over the coffee was bound to end in a blind\\nalley, but i restrained my tongue. after all, though he was old, poirot\\nhad been a great man in his day.\\n\\n“breakfast is ready,” said john cavendish, coming in from the hall.\\n“you will breakfast with us, monsieur poirot?”\\n\\npoirot acquiesced. i observed john. already he was almost restored to\\nhis normal self. the shock of the events of the last night had upset\\nhim temporarily, but his equable poise soon swung back to the normal.\\nhe was a man of very little imagination, in sharp contrast with his\\nbrother, who had, perhaps, too much.\\n\\never since the early hours of the morning, john had been hard at work,\\nsending telegrams—one of the first had gone to evelyn howard—writing\\nnotices for the papers, and generally occupying himself with the\\nmelancholy duties that a death entails.\\n\\n“may i ask how things are proceeding?” he said. “do your investigations\\npoint to my mother having died a natural death—or—or must we prepare\\nourselves for the worst?”\\n\\n“i think, mr. cavendish,” said poirot gravely, “that you would do well\\nnot to buoy yourself up with any false hopes. can you tell me the views\\nof the other members of the family?”\\n\\n“my brother lawrence is convinced that we are making a fuss over\\nnothing. he says that everything points to its being a simple case of\\nheart failure.”\\n\\n“he does, does he? that is very interesting—very interesting,” murmured\\npoirot softly. “and mrs. cavendish?”\\n\\na faint cloud passed over john’s face.\\n\\n“i have not the least idea what my wife’s views on the subject are.”\\n\\nthe answer brought a momentary stiffness in its train. john broke the\\nrather awkward silence by saying with a slight effort:\\n\\n“i told you, didn’t i, that mr. inglethorp has returned?”\\n\\npoirot bent his head.\\n\\n“it’s an awkward position for all of us. of course one has to treat him\\nas usual—but, hang it all, one’s gorge does rise at sitting down to eat\\nwith a possible murderer!”\\n\\npoirot nodded sympathetically.\\n\\n“i quite understand. it is a very difficult situation for you, mr.\\ncavendish. i would like to ask you one question. mr. inglethorp’s\\nreason for not returning last night was, i believe, that he had\\nforgotten the latch-key. is not that so?”\\n\\n“yes.”\\n\\n“i suppose you are quite sure that the latch-key _was_ forgotten—that\\nhe did not take it after all?”\\n\\n“i have no idea. i never thought of looking. we always keep it in the\\nhall drawer. i’ll go and see if it’s there now.”\\n\\npoirot held up his hand with a faint smile.\\n\\n“no, no, mr. cavendish, it is too late now. i am certain that you would\\nfind it. if mr. inglethorp did take it, he has had ample time to\\nreplace it by now.”\\n\\n“but do you think——”\\n\\n“i think nothing. if anyone had chanced to look this morning before his\\nreturn, and seen it there, it would have been a valuable point in his\\nfavour. that is all.”\\n\\njohn looked perplexed.\\n\\n“do not worry,” said poirot smoothly. “i assure you that you need not\\nlet it trouble you. since you are so kind, let us go and have some\\nbreakfast.”\\n\\neveryone was assembled in the dining-room. under the circumstances, we\\nwere naturally not a cheerful party. the reaction after a shock is\\nalways trying, and i think we were all suffering from it. decorum and\\ngood breeding naturally enjoined that our demeanour should be much as\\nusual, yet i could not help wondering if this self-control were really\\na matter of great difficulty. there were no red eyes, no signs of\\nsecretly indulged grief. i felt that i was right in my opinion that\\ndorcas was the person most affected by the personal side of the\\ntragedy.\\n\\ni pass over alfred inglethorp, who acted the bereaved widower in a\\nmanner that i felt to be disgusting in its hypocrisy. did he know that\\nwe suspected him, i wondered. surely he could not be unaware of the\\nfact, conceal it as we would. did he feel some secret stirring of fear,\\nor was he confident that his crime would go unpunished? surely the\\nsuspicion in the atmosphere must warn him that he was already a marked\\nman.\\n\\nbut did everyone suspect him? what about mrs. cavendish? i watched her\\nas she sat at the head of the table, graceful, composed, enigmatic. in\\nher soft grey frock, with white ruffles at the wrists falling over her\\nslender hands, she looked very beautiful. when she chose, however, her\\nface could be sphinx-like in its inscrutability. she was very silent,\\nhardly opening her lips, and yet in some queer way i felt that the\\ngreat strength of her personality was dominating us all.\\n\\nand little cynthia? did she suspect? she looked very tired and ill, i\\nthought. the heaviness and languor of her manner were very marked. i\\nasked her if she were feeling ill, and she answered frankly:\\n\\n“yes, i’ve got the most beastly headache.”\\n\\n“have another cup of coffee, mademoiselle?” said poirot solicitously.\\n“it will revive you. it is unparalleled for the _mal de tête_.” he\\njumped up and took her cup.\\n\\n“no sugar,” said cynthia, watching him, as he picked up the\\nsugar-tongs.\\n\\n“no sugar? you abandon it in the war-time, eh?”\\n\\n“no, i never take it in coffee.”\\n\\n“_sacré!_” murmured poirot to himself, as he brought back the\\nreplenished cup.\\n\\nonly i heard him, and glancing up curiously at the little man i saw\\nthat his face was working with suppressed excitement, and his eyes were\\nas green as a cat’s. he had heard or seen something that had affected\\nhim strongly—but what was it? i do not usually label myself as dense,\\nbut i must confess that nothing out of the ordinary had attracted _my_\\nattention.\\n\\nin another moment, the door opened and dorcas appeared.\\n\\n“mr. wells to see you, sir,” she said to john.\\n\\ni remembered the name as being that of the lawyer to whom mrs.\\ninglethorp had written the night before.\\n\\njohn rose immediately.\\n\\n“show him into my study.” then he turned to us. “my mother’s lawyer,”\\nhe explained. and in a lower voice: “he is also coroner—you understand.\\nperhaps you would like to come with me?”\\n\\nwe acquiesced and followed him out of the room. john strode on ahead\\nand i took the opportunity of whispering to poirot:\\n\\n“there will be an inquest then?”\\n\\npoirot nodded absently. he seemed absorbed in thought; so much so that\\nmy curiosity was aroused.\\n\\n“what is it? you are not attending to what i say.”\\n\\n“it is true, my friend. i am much worried.”\\n\\n“why?”\\n\\n“because mademoiselle cynthia does not take sugar in her coffee.”\\n\\n“what? you cannot be serious?”\\n\\n“but i am most serious. ah, there is something there that i do not\\nunderstand. my instinct was right.”\\n\\n“what instinct?”\\n\\n“the instinct that led me to insist on examining those coffee-cups.\\n_chut!_ no more now!”\\n\\nwe followed john into his study, and he closed the door behind us.\\n\\nmr. wells was a pleasant man of middle-age, with keen eyes, and the\\ntypical lawyer’s mouth. john introduced us both, and explained the\\nreason of our presence.\\n\\n“you will understand, wells,” he added, “that this is all strictly\\nprivate. we are still hoping that there will turn out to be no need for\\ninvestigation of any kind.”\\n\\n“quite so, quite so,” said mr. wells soothingly. “i wish we could have\\nspared you the pain and publicity of an inquest, but of course it’s\\nquite unavoidable in the absence of a doctor’s certificate.”\\n\\n“yes, i suppose so.”\\n\\n“clever man, bauerstein. great authority on toxicology, i believe.”\\n\\n“indeed,” said john with a certain stiffness in his manner. then he\\nadded rather hesitatingly: “shall we have to appear as witnesses—all of\\nus, i mean?”\\n\\n“you, of course—and ah—er—mr.—er—inglethorp.”\\n\\na slight pause ensued before the lawyer went on in his soothing manner:\\n\\n“any other evidence will be simply confirmatory, a mere matter of\\nform.”\\n\\n“i see.”\\n\\na faint expression of relief swept over john’s face. it puzzled me, for\\ni saw no occasion for it.\\n\\n“if you know of nothing to the contrary,” pursued mr. wells, “i had\\nthought of friday. that will give us plenty of time for the doctor’s\\nreport. the post-mortem is to take place to-night, i believe?”\\n\\n“yes.”\\n\\n“then that arrangement will suit you?”\\n\\n“perfectly.”\\n\\n“i need not tell you, my dear cavendish, how distressed i am at this\\nmost tragic affair.”\\n\\n“can you give us no help in solving it, monsieur?” interposed poirot,\\nspeaking for the first time since we had entered the room.\\n\\n“i?”\\n\\n“yes, we heard that mrs. inglethorp wrote to you last night. you should\\nhave received the letter this morning.”\\n\\n“i did, but it contains no information. it is merely a note asking me\\nto call upon her this morning, as she wanted my advice on a matter of\\ngreat importance.”\\n\\n“she gave you no hint as to what that matter might be?”\\n\\n“unfortunately, no.”\\n\\n“that is a pity,” said john.\\n\\n“a great pity,” agreed poirot gravely.\\n\\nthere was silence. poirot remained lost in thought for a few minutes.\\nfinally he turned to the lawyer again.\\n\\n“mr. wells, there is one thing i should like to ask you—that is, if it\\nis not against professional etiquette. in the event of mrs.\\ninglethorp’s death, who would inherit her money?”\\n\\nthe lawyer hesitated a moment, and then replied:\\n\\n“the knowledge will be public property very soon, so if mr. cavendish\\ndoes not object——”\\n\\n“not at all,” interpolated john.\\n\\n“i do not see any reason why i should not answer your question. by her\\nlast will, dated august of last year, after various unimportant\\nlegacies to servants, etc., she gave her entire fortune to her stepson,\\nmr. john cavendish.”\\n\\n“was not that—pardon the question, mr. cavendish—rather unfair to her\\nother stepson, mr. lawrence cavendish?”\\n\\n“no, i do not think so. you see, under the terms of their father’s\\nwill, while john inherited the property, lawrence, at his stepmother’s\\ndeath, would come into a considerable sum of money. mrs. inglethorp\\nleft her money to her elder stepson, knowing that he would have to keep\\nup styles. it was, to my mind, a very fair and equitable distribution.”\\n\\npoirot nodded thoughtfully.\\n\\n“i see. but i am right in saying, am i not, that by your english law\\nthat will was automatically revoked when mrs. inglethorp remarried?”\\n\\nmr. wells bowed his head.\\n\\n“as i was about to proceed, monsieur poirot, that document is now null\\nand void.”\\n\\n“_hein!_” said poirot. he reflected for a moment, and then asked: “was\\nmrs. inglethorp herself aware of that fact?”\\n\\n“i do not know. she may have been.”\\n\\n“she was,” said john unexpectedly. “we were discussing the matter of\\nwills being revoked by marriage only yesterday.”\\n\\n“ah! one more question, mr. wells. you say ‘her last will.’ had mrs.\\ninglethorp, then, made several former wills?”\\n\\n“on an average, she made a new will at least once a year,” said mr.\\nwells imperturbably. “she was given to changing her mind as to her\\ntestamentary dispositions, now benefiting one, now another member of\\nher family.”\\n\\n“suppose,” suggested poirot, “that, unknown to you, she had made a new\\nwill in favour of someone who was not, in any sense of the word, a\\nmember of the family—we will say miss howard, for instance—would you be\\nsurprised?”\\n\\n“not in the least.”\\n\\n“ah!” poirot seemed to have exhausted his questions.\\n\\ni drew close to him, while john and the lawyer were debating the\\nquestion of going through mrs. inglethorp’s papers.\\n\\n“do you think mrs. inglethorp made a will leaving all her money to miss\\nhoward?” i asked in a low voice, with some curiosity.\\n\\npoirot smiled.\\n\\n“no.”\\n\\n“then why did you ask?”\\n\\n“hush!”\\n\\njohn cavendish had turned to poirot.\\n\\n“will you come with us, monsieur poirot? we are going through my\\nmother’s papers. mr. inglethorp is quite willing to leave it entirely\\nto mr. wells and myself.”\\n\\n“which simplifies matters very much,” murmured the lawyer. “as\\ntechnically, of course, he was entitled——” he did not finish the\\nsentence.\\n\\n“we will look through the desk in the boudoir first,” explained john,\\n“and go up to her bedroom afterwards. she kept her most important\\npapers in a purple despatch-case, which we must look through\\ncarefully.”\\n\\n“yes,” said the lawyer, “it is quite possible that there may be a later\\nwill than the one in my possession.”\\n\\n“there _is_ a later will.” it was poirot who spoke.\\n\\n“what?” john and the lawyer looked at him startled.\\n\\n“or, rather,” pursued my friend imperturbably, “there _was_ one.”\\n\\n“what do you mean—there was one? where is it now?”\\n\\n“burnt!”\\n\\n“burnt?”\\n\\n“yes. see here.” he took out the charred fragment we had found in the\\ngrate in mrs. inglethorp’s room, and handed it to the lawyer with a\\nbrief explanation of when and where he had found it.\\n\\n“but possibly this is an old will?”\\n\\n“i do not think so. in fact i am almost certain that it was made no\\nearlier than yesterday afternoon.”\\n\\n“what?” “impossible!” broke simultaneously from both men.\\n\\npoirot turned to john.\\n\\n“if you will allow me to send for your gardener, i will prove it to\\nyou.”\\n\\n“oh, of course—but i don’t see——”\\n\\npoirot raised his hand.\\n\\n“do as i ask you. afterwards you shall question as much as you please.”\\n\\n“very well.” he rang the bell.\\n\\ndorcas answered it in due course.\\n\\n“dorcas, will you tell manning to come round and speak to me here.”\\n\\n“yes, sir.”\\n\\ndorcas withdrew.\\n\\nwe waited in a tense silence. poirot alone seemed perfectly at his\\nease, and dusted a forgotten corner of the bookcase.\\n\\nthe clumping of hobnailed boots on the gravel outside proclaimed the\\napproach of manning. john looked questioningly at poirot. the latter\\nnodded.\\n\\n“come inside, manning,” said john, “i want to speak to you.”\\n\\nmanning came slowly and hesitatingly through the french window, and\\nstood as near it as he could. he held his cap in his hands, twisting it\\nvery carefully round and round. his back was much bent, though he was\\nprobably not as old as he looked, but his eyes were sharp and\\nintelligent, and belied his slow and rather cautious speech.\\n\\n“manning,” said john, “this gentleman will put some questions to you\\nwhich i want you to answer.”\\n\\n“yessir,” mumbled manning.\\n\\npoirot stepped forward briskly. manning’s eye swept over him with a\\nfaint contempt.\\n\\n“you were planting a bed of begonias round by the south side of the\\nhouse yesterday afternoon, were you not, manning?”\\n\\n“yes, sir, me and willum.”\\n\\n“and mrs. inglethorp came to the window and called you, did she not?”\\n\\n“yes, sir, she did.”\\n\\n“tell me in your own words exactly what happened after that.”\\n\\n“well, sir, nothing much. she just told willum to go on his bicycle\\ndown to the village, and bring back a form of will, or such-like—i\\ndon’t know what exactly—she wrote it down for him.”\\n\\n“well?”\\n\\n“well, he did, sir.”\\n\\n“and what happened next?”\\n\\n“we went on with the begonias, sir.”\\n\\n“did not mrs. inglethorp call you again?”\\n\\n“yes, sir, both me and willum, she called.”\\n\\n“and then?”\\n\\n“she made us come right in, and sign our names at the bottom of a long\\npaper—under where she’d signed.”\\n\\n“did you see anything of what was written above her signature?” asked\\npoirot sharply.\\n\\n“no, sir, there was a bit of blotting paper over that part.”\\n\\n“and you signed where she told you?”\\n\\n“yes, sir, first me and then willum.”\\n\\n“what did she do with it afterwards?”\\n\\n“well, sir, she slipped it into a long envelope, and put it inside a\\nsort of purple box that was standing on the desk.”\\n\\n“what time was it when she first called you?”\\n\\n“about four, i should say, sir.”\\n\\n“not earlier? couldn’t it have been about half-past three?”\\n\\n“no, i shouldn’t say so, sir. it would be more likely to be a bit after\\nfour—not before it.”\\n\\n“thank you, manning, that will do,” said poirot pleasantly.\\n\\nthe gardener glanced at his master, who nodded, whereupon manning\\nlifted a finger to his forehead with a low mumble, and backed\\ncautiously out of the window.\\n\\nwe all looked at each other.\\n\\n“good heavens!” murmured john. “what an extraordinary coincidence.”\\n\\n“how—a coincidence?”\\n\\n“that my mother should have made a will on the very day of her death!”\\n\\nmr. wells cleared his throat and remarked drily:\\n\\n“are you so sure it is a coincidence, cavendish?”\\n\\n“what do you mean?”\\n\\n“your mother, you tell me, had a violent quarrel with—someone yesterday\\nafternoon——”\\n\\n“what do you mean?” cried john again. there was a tremor in his voice,\\nand he had gone very pale.\\n\\n“in consequence of that quarrel, your mother very suddenly and\\nhurriedly makes a new will. the contents of that will we shall never\\nknow. she told no one of its provisions. this morning, no doubt, she\\nwould have consulted me on the subject—but she had no chance. the will\\ndisappears, and she takes its secret with her to her grave. cavendish,\\ni much fear there is no coincidence there. monsieur poirot, i am sure\\nyou agree with me that the facts are very suggestive.”\\n\\n“suggestive, or not,” interrupted john, “we are most grateful to\\nmonsieur poirot for elucidating the matter. but for him, we should\\nnever have known of this will. i suppose, i may not ask you, monsieur,\\nwhat first led you to suspect the fact?”\\n\\npoirot smiled and answered:\\n\\n“a scribbled over old envelope, and a freshly planted bed of begonias.”\\n\\njohn, i think, would have pressed his questions further, but at that\\nmoment the loud purr of a motor was audible, and we all turned to the\\nwindow as it swept past.\\n\\n“evie!” cried john. “excuse me, wells.” he went hurriedly out into the\\nhall.\\n\\npoirot looked inquiringly at me.\\n\\n“miss howard,” i explained.\\n\\n“ah, i am glad she has come. there is a woman with a head and a heart\\ntoo, hastings. though the good god gave her no beauty!”\\n\\ni followed john’s example, and went out into the hall, where miss\\nhoward was endeavouring to extricate herself from the voluminous mass\\nof veils that enveloped her head. as her eyes fell on me, a sudden pang\\nof guilt shot through me. this was the woman who had warned me so\\nearnestly, and to whose warning i had, alas, paid no heed! how soon,\\nand how contemptuously, i had dismissed it from my mind. now that she\\nhad been proved justified in so tragic a manner, i felt ashamed. she\\nhad known alfred inglethorp only too well. i wondered whether, if she\\nhad remained at styles, the tragedy would have taken place, or would\\nthe man have feared her watchful eyes?\\n\\ni was relieved when she shook me by the hand, with her well remembered\\npainful grip. the eyes that met mine were sad, but not reproachful;\\nthat she had been crying bitterly, i could tell by the redness of her\\neyelids, but her manner was unchanged from its old gruffness.\\n\\n“started the moment i got the wire. just come off night duty. hired\\ncar. quickest way to get here.”\\n\\n“have you had anything to eat this morning, evie?” asked john.\\n\\n“no.”\\n\\n“i thought not. come along, breakfast’s not cleared away yet, and\\nthey’ll make you some fresh tea.” he turned to me. “look after her,\\nhastings, will you? wells is waiting for me. oh, here’s monsieur\\npoirot. he’s helping us, you know, evie.”\\n\\nmiss howard shook hands with poirot, but glanced suspiciously over her\\nshoulder at john.\\n\\n“what do you mean—helping us?”\\n\\n“helping us to investigate.”\\n\\n“nothing to investigate. have they taken him to prison yet?”\\n\\n“taken who to prison?”\\n\\n“who? alfred inglethorp, of course!”\\n\\n“my dear evie, do be careful. lawrence is of the opinion that my mother\\ndied from heart seizure.”\\n\\n“more fool, lawrence!” retorted miss howard. “of course alfred\\ninglethorp murdered poor emily—as i always told you he would.”\\n\\n“my dear evie, don’t shout so. whatever we may think or suspect, it is\\nbetter to say as little as possible for the present. the inquest isn’t\\nuntil friday.”\\n\\n“not until fiddlesticks!” the snort miss howard gave was truly\\nmagnificent. “you’re all off your heads. the man will be out of the\\ncountry by then. if he’s any sense, he won’t stay here tamely and wait\\nto be hanged.”\\n\\njohn cavendish looked at her helplessly.\\n\\n“i know what it is,” she accused him, “you’ve been listening to the\\ndoctors. never should. what do they know? nothing at all—or just enough\\nto make them dangerous. i ought to know—my own father was a doctor.\\nthat little wilkins is about the greatest fool that even i have ever\\nseen. heart seizure! sort of thing he would say. anyone with any sense\\ncould see at once that her husband had poisoned her. i always said he’d\\nmurder her in her bed, poor soul. now he’s done it. and all you can do\\nis to murmur silly things about ‘heart seizure’ and ‘inquest on\\nfriday.’ you ought to be ashamed of yourself, john cavendish.”\\n\\n“what do you want me to do?” asked john, unable to help a faint smile.\\n“dash it all, evie, i can’t haul him down to the local police station\\nby the scruff of his neck.”\\n\\n“well, you might do something. find out how he did it. he’s a crafty\\nbeggar. dare say he soaked fly papers. ask cook if she’s missed any.”\\n\\nit occurred to me very forcibly at that moment that to harbour miss\\nhoward and alfred inglethorp under the same roof, and keep the peace\\nbetween them, was likely to prove a herculean task, and i did not envy\\njohn. i could see by the expression of his face that he fully\\nappreciated the difficulty of the position. for the moment, he sought\\nrefuge in retreat, and left the room precipitately.\\n\\ndorcas brought in fresh tea. as she left the room, poirot came over\\nfrom the window where he had been standing, and sat down facing miss\\nhoward.\\n\\n“mademoiselle,” he said gravely, “i want to ask you something.”\\n\\n“ask away,” said the lady, eyeing him with some disfavour.\\n\\n“i want to be able to count upon your help.”\\n\\n“i’ll help you to hang alfred with pleasure,” she replied gruffly.\\n“hanging’s too good for him. ought to be drawn and quartered, like in\\ngood old times.”\\n\\n“we are at one then,” said poirot, “for i, too, want to hang the\\ncriminal.”\\n\\n“alfred inglethorp?”\\n\\n“him, or another.”\\n\\n“no question of another. poor emily was never murdered until _he_ came\\nalong. i don’t say she wasn’t surrounded by sharks—she was. but it was\\nonly her purse they were after. her life was safe enough. but along\\ncomes mr. alfred inglethorp—and within two months—hey presto!”\\n\\n“believe me, miss howard,” said poirot very earnestly, “if mr.\\ninglethorp is the man, he shall not escape me. on my honour, i will\\nhang him as high as haman!”\\n\\n“that’s better,” said miss howard more enthusiastically.\\n\\n“but i must ask you to trust me. now your help may be very valuable to\\nme. i will tell you why. because, in all this house of mourning, yours\\nare the only eyes that have wept.”\\n\\nmiss howard blinked, and a new note crept into the gruffness of her\\nvoice.\\n\\n“if you mean that i was fond of her—yes, i was. you know, emily was a\\nselfish old woman in her way. she was very generous, but she always\\nwanted a return. she never let people forget what she had done for\\nthem—and, that way she missed love. don’t think she ever realized it,\\nthough, or felt the lack of it. hope not, anyway. i was on a different\\nfooting. i took my stand from the first. ‘so many pounds a year i’m\\nworth to you. well and good. but not a penny piece besides—not a pair\\nof gloves, nor a theatre ticket.’ she didn’t understand—was very\\noffended sometimes. said i was foolishly proud. it wasn’t that—but i\\ncouldn’t explain. anyway, i kept my self-respect. and so, out of the\\nwhole bunch, i was the only one who could allow myself to be fond of\\nher. i watched over her. i guarded her from the lot of them, and then a\\nglib-tongued scoundrel comes along, and pooh! all my years of devotion\\ngo for nothing.”\\n\\npoirot nodded sympathetically.\\n\\n“i understand, mademoiselle, i understand all you feel. it is most\\nnatural. you think that we are lukewarm—that we lack fire and\\nenergy—but trust me, it is not so.”\\n\\njohn stuck his head in at this juncture, and invited us both to come up\\nto mrs. inglethorp’s room, as he and mr. wells had finished looking\\nthrough the desk in the boudoir.\\n\\nas we went up the stairs, john looked back to the dining-room door, and\\nlowered his voice confidentially:\\n\\n“look here, what’s going to happen when these two meet?”\\n\\ni shook my head helplessly.\\n\\n“i’ve told mary to keep them apart if she can.”\\n\\n“will she be able to do so?”\\n\\n“the lord only knows. there’s one thing, inglethorp himself won’t be\\ntoo keen on meeting her.”\\n\\n“you’ve got the keys still, haven’t you, poirot?” i asked, as we\\nreached the door of the locked room.\\n\\ntaking the keys from poirot, john unlocked it, and we all passed in.\\nthe lawyer went straight to the desk, and john followed him.\\n\\n“my mother kept most of her important papers in this despatch-case, i\\nbelieve,” he said.\\n\\npoirot drew out the small bunch of keys.\\n\\n“permit me. i locked it, out of precaution, this morning.”\\n\\n“but it’s not locked now.”\\n\\n“impossible!”\\n\\n“see.” and john lifted the lid as he spoke.\\n\\n“_milles tonnerres!_” cried poirot, dumbfounded. “and i—who have both\\nthe keys in my pocket!” he flung himself upon the case. suddenly he\\nstiffened. “_eh voilà une affaire!_ this lock has been forced.”\\n\\n“what?”\\n\\npoirot laid down the case again.\\n\\n“but who forced it? why should they? when? but the door was locked?”\\nthese exclamations burst from us disjointedly.\\n\\npoirot answered them categorically—almost mechanically.\\n\\n“who? that is the question. why? ah, if i only knew. when? since i was\\nhere an hour ago. as to the door being locked, it is a very ordinary\\nlock. probably any other of the doorkeys in this passage would fit it.”\\n\\nwe stared at one another blankly. poirot had walked over to the\\nmantelpiece. he was outwardly calm, but i noticed his hands, which from\\nlong force of habit were mechanically straightening the spill vases on\\nthe mantelpiece, were shaking violently.\\n\\n“see here, it was like this,” he said at last. “there was something in\\nthat case—some piece of evidence, slight in itself perhaps, but still\\nenough of a clue to connect the murderer with the crime. it was vital\\nto him that it should be destroyed before it was discovered and its\\nsignificance appreciated. therefore, he took the risk, the great risk,\\nof coming in here. finding the case locked, he was obliged to force it,\\nthus betraying his presence. for him to take that risk, it must have\\nbeen something of great importance.”\\n\\n“but what was it?”\\n\\n“ah!” cried poirot, with a gesture of anger. “that, i do not know! a\\ndocument of some kind, without doubt, possibly the scrap of paper\\ndorcas saw in her hand yesterday afternoon. and i—” his anger burst\\nforth freely—“miserable animal that i am! i guessed nothing! i have\\nbehaved like an imbecile! i should never have left that case here. i\\nshould have carried it away with me. ah, triple pig! and now it is\\ngone. it is destroyed—but is it destroyed? is there not yet a chance—we\\nmust leave no stone unturned—”\\n\\nhe rushed like a madman from the room, and i followed him as soon as i\\nhad sufficiently recovered my wits. but, by the time i had reached the\\ntop of the stairs, he was out of sight.\\n\\nmary cavendish was standing where the staircase branched, staring down\\ninto the hall in the direction in which he had disappeared.\\n\\n“what has happened to your extraordinary little friend, mr. hastings?\\nhe has just rushed past me like a mad bull.”\\n\\n“he’s rather upset about something,” i remarked feebly. i really did\\nnot know how much poirot would wish me to disclose. as i saw a faint\\nsmile gather on mrs. cavendish’s expressive mouth, i endeavoured to try\\nand turn the conversation by saying: “they haven’t met yet, have they?”\\n\\n“who?”\\n\\n“mr. inglethorp and miss howard.”\\n\\nshe looked at me in rather a disconcerting manner.\\n\\n“do you think it would be such a disaster if they did meet?”\\n\\n“well, don’t you?” i said, rather taken aback.\\n\\n“no.” she was smiling in her quiet way. “i should like to see a good\\nflare up. it would clear the air. at present we are all thinking so\\nmuch, and saying so little.”\\n\\n“john doesn’t think so,” i remarked. “he’s anxious to keep them apart.”\\n\\n“oh, john!”\\n\\nsomething in her tone fired me, and i blurted out:\\n\\n“old john’s an awfully good sort.”\\n\\nshe studied me curiously for a minute or two, and then said, to my\\ngreat surprise:\\n\\n“you are loyal to your friend. i like you for that.”\\n\\n“aren’t you my friend too?”\\n\\n“i am a very bad friend.”\\n\\n“why do you say that?”\\n\\n“because it is true. i am charming to my friends one day, and forget\\nall about them the next.”\\n\\ni don’t know what impelled me, but i was nettled, and i said foolishly\\nand not in the best of taste:\\n\\n“yet you seem to be invariably charming to dr. bauerstein!”\\n\\ninstantly i regretted my words. her face stiffened. i had the\\nimpression of a steel curtain coming down and blotting out the real\\nwoman. without a word, she turned and went swiftly up the stairs,\\nwhilst i stood like an idiot gaping after her.\\n\\ni was recalled to other matters by a frightful row going on below. i\\ncould hear poirot shouting and expounding. i was vexed to think that my\\ndiplomacy had been in vain. the little man appeared to be taking the\\nwhole house into his confidence, a proceeding of which i, for one,\\ndoubted the wisdom. once again i could not help regretting that my\\nfriend was so prone to lose his head in moments of excitement. i\\nstepped briskly down the stairs. the sight of me calmed poirot almost\\nimmediately. i drew him aside.\\n\\n“my dear fellow,” i said, “is this wise? surely you don’t want the\\nwhole house to know of this occurrence? you are actually playing into\\nthe criminal’s hands.”\\n\\n“you think so, hastings?”\\n\\n“i am sure of it.”\\n\\n“well, well, my friend, i will be guided by you.”\\n\\n“good. although, unfortunately, it is a little too late now.”\\n\\n“sure.”\\n\\nhe looked so crestfallen and abashed that i felt quite sorry, though i\\nstill thought my rebuke a just and wise one.\\n\\n“well,” he said at last, “let us go, _mon ami_.”\\n\\n“you have finished here?”\\n\\n“for the moment, yes. you will walk back with me to the village?”\\n\\n“willingly.”\\n\\nhe picked up his little suit-case, and we went out through the open\\nwindow in the drawing-room. cynthia murdoch was just coming in, and\\npoirot stood aside to let her pass.\\n\\n“excuse me, mademoiselle, one minute.”\\n\\n“yes?” she turned inquiringly.\\n\\n“did you ever make up mrs. inglethorp’s medicines?”\\n\\na slight flush rose in her face, as she answered rather constrainedly:\\n\\n“no.”\\n\\n“only her powders?”\\n\\nthe flush deepened as cynthia replied:\\n\\n“oh, yes, i did make up some sleeping powders for her once.”\\n\\n“these?”\\n\\npoirot produced the empty box which had contained powders.\\n\\nshe nodded.\\n\\n“can you tell me what they were? sulphonal? veronal?”\\n\\n“no, they were bromide powders.”\\n\\n“ah! thank you, mademoiselle; good morning.”\\n\\nas we walked briskly away from the house, i glanced at him more than\\nonce. i had often before noticed that, if anything excited him, his\\neyes turned green like a cat’s. they were shining like emeralds now.\\n\\n“my friend,” he broke out at last, “i have a little idea, a very\\nstrange, and probably utterly impossible idea. and yet—it fits in.”\\n\\ni shrugged my shoulders. i privately thought that poirot was rather too\\nmuch given to these fantastic ideas. in this case, surely, the truth\\nwas only too plain and apparent.\\n\\n“so that is the explanation of the blank label on the box,” i remarked.\\n“very simple, as you said. i really wonder that i did not think of it\\nmyself.”\\n\\npoirot did not appear to be listening to me.\\n\\n“they have made one more discovery, _là-bas_,” he observed, jerking his\\nthumb over his shoulder in the direction of styles. “mr. wells told me\\nas we were going upstairs.”\\n\\n“what was it?”\\n\\n“locked up in the desk in the boudoir, they found a will of mrs.\\ninglethorp’s, dated before her marriage, leaving her fortune to alfred\\ninglethorp. it must have been made just at the time they were engaged.\\nit came quite as a surprise to wells—and to john cavendish also. it was\\nwritten on one of those printed will forms, and witnessed by two of the\\nservants—not dorcas.”\\n\\n“did mr. inglethorp know of it?”\\n\\n“he says not.”\\n\\n“one might take that with a grain of salt,” i remarked sceptically.\\n“all these wills are very confusing. tell me, how did those scribbled\\nwords on the envelope help you to discover that a will was made\\nyesterday afternoon?”\\n\\npoirot smiled.\\n\\n“_mon ami_, have you ever, when writing a letter, been arrested by the\\nfact that you did not know how to spell a certain word?”\\n\\n“yes, often. i suppose everyone has.”\\n\\n“exactly. and have you not, in such a case, tried the word once or\\ntwice on the edge of the blotting-paper, or a spare scrap of paper, to\\nsee if it looked right? well, that is what mrs. inglethorp did. you\\nwill notice that the word ‘possessed’ is spelt first with one ‘s’ and\\nsubsequently with two—correctly. to make sure, she had further tried it\\nin a sentence, thus: ‘i am possessed.’ now, what did that tell me? it\\ntold me that mrs. inglethorp had been writing the word ‘possessed’ that\\nafternoon, and, having the fragment of paper found in the grate fresh\\nin my mind, the possibility of a will—(a document almost certain to\\ncontain that word)—occurred to me at once. this possibility was\\nconfirmed by a further circumstance. in the general confusion, the\\nboudoir had not been swept that morning, and near the desk were several\\ntraces of brown mould and earth. the weather had been perfectly fine\\nfor some days, and no ordinary boots would have left such a heavy\\ndeposit.\\n\\n“i strolled to the window, and saw at once that the begonia beds had\\nbeen newly planted. the mould in the beds was exactly similar to that\\non the floor of the boudoir, and also i learnt from you that they _had_\\nbeen planted yesterday afternoon. i was now sure that one, or possibly\\nboth of the gardeners—for there were two sets of footprints in the\\nbed—had entered the boudoir, for if mrs. inglethorp had merely wished\\nto speak to them she would in all probability have stood at the window,\\nand they would not have come into the room at all. i was now quite\\nconvinced that she had made a fresh will, and had called the two\\ngardeners in to witness her signature. events proved that i was right\\nin my supposition.”\\n\\n“that was very ingenious,” i could not help admitting. “i must confess\\nthat the conclusions i drew from those few scribbled words were quite\\nerroneous.”\\n\\nhe smiled.\\n\\n“you gave too much rein to your imagination. imagination is a good\\nservant, and a bad master. the simplest explanation is always the most\\nlikely.”\\n\\n“another point—how did you know that the key of the despatch-case had\\nbeen lost?”\\n\\n“i did not know it. it was a guess that turned out to be correct. you\\nobserved that it had a piece of twisted wire through the handle. that\\nsuggested to me at once that it had possibly been wrenched off a flimsy\\nkey-ring. now, if it had been lost and recovered, mrs. inglethorp would\\nat once have replaced it on her bunch; but on her bunch i found what\\nwas obviously the duplicate key, very new and bright, which led me to\\nthe hypothesis that somebody else had inserted the original key in the\\nlock of the despatch-case.”\\n\\n“yes,” i said, “alfred inglethorp, without doubt.”\\n\\npoirot looked at me curiously.\\n\\n“you are very sure of his guilt?”\\n\\n“well, naturally. every fresh circumstance seems to establish it more\\nclearly.”\\n\\n“on the contrary,” said poirot quietly, “there are several points in\\nhis favour.”\\n\\n“oh, come now!”\\n\\n“yes.”\\n\\n“i see only one.”\\n\\n“and that?”\\n\\n“that he was not in the house last night.”\\n\\n“‘bad shot!’ as you english say! you have chosen the one point that to\\nmy mind tells against him.”\\n\\n“how is that?”\\n\\n“because if mr. inglethorp knew that his wife would be poisoned last\\nnight, he would certainly have arranged to be away from the house. his\\nexcuse was an obviously trumped up one. that leaves us two\\npossibilities: either he knew what was going to happen or he had a\\nreason of his own for his absence.”\\n\\n“and that reason?” i asked sceptically.\\n\\npoirot shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n“how should i know? discreditable, without doubt. this mr. inglethorp,\\ni should say, is somewhat of a scoundrel—but that does not of necessity\\nmake him a murderer.”\\n\\ni shook my head, unconvinced.\\n\\n“we do not agree, eh?” said poirot. “well, let us leave it. time will\\nshow which of us is right. now let us turn to other aspects of the\\ncase. what do you make of the fact that all the doors of the bedroom\\nwere bolted on the inside?”\\n\\n“well——” i considered. “one must look at it logically.”\\n\\n“true.”\\n\\n“i should put it this way. the doors _were_ bolted—our own eyes have\\ntold us that—yet the presence of the candle grease on the floor, and\\nthe destruction of the will, prove that during the night someone\\nentered the room. you agree so far?”\\n\\n“perfectly. put with admirable clearness. proceed.”\\n\\n“well,” i said, encouraged, “as the person who entered did not do so by\\nthe window, nor by miraculous means, it follows that the door must have\\nbeen opened from inside by mrs. inglethorp herself. that strengthens\\nthe conviction that the person in question was her husband. she would\\nnaturally open the door to her own husband.”\\n\\npoirot shook his head.\\n\\n“why should she? she had bolted the door leading into his room—a most\\nunusual proceeding on her part—she had had a most violent quarrel with\\nhim that very afternoon. no, he was the last person she would admit.”\\n\\n“but you agree with me that the door must have been opened by mrs.\\ninglethorp herself?”\\n\\n“there is another possibility. she may have forgotten to bolt the door\\ninto the passage when she went to bed, and have got up later, towards\\nmorning, and bolted it then.”\\n\\n“poirot, is that seriously your opinion?”\\n\\n“no, i do not say it is so, but it might be. now, to turn to another\\nfeature, what do you make of the scrap of conversation you overheard\\nbetween mrs. cavendish and her mother-in-law?”\\n\\n“i had forgotten that,” i said thoughtfully. “that is as enigmatical as\\never. it seems incredible that a woman like mrs. cavendish, proud and\\nreticent to the last degree, should interfere so violently in what was\\ncertainly not her affair.”\\n\\n“precisely. it was an astonishing thing for a woman of her breeding to\\ndo.”\\n\\n“it is certainly curious,” i agreed. “still, it is unimportant, and\\nneed not be taken into account.”\\n\\na groan burst from poirot.\\n\\n“what have i always told you? everything must be taken into account. if\\nthe fact will not fit the theory—let the theory go.”\\n\\n“well, we shall see,” i said, nettled.\\n\\n“yes, we shall see.”\\n\\nwe had reached leastways cottage, and poirot ushered me upstairs to his\\nown room. he offered me one of the tiny russian cigarettes he himself\\noccasionally smoked. i was amused to notice that he stowed away the\\nused matches most carefully in a little china pot. my momentary\\nannoyance vanished.\\n\\npoirot had placed our two chairs in front of the open window which\\ncommanded a view of the village street. the fresh air blew in warm and\\npleasant. it was going to be a hot day.\\n\\nsuddenly my attention was arrested by a weedy looking young man rushing\\ndown the street at a great pace. it was the expression on his face that\\nwas extraordinary—a curious mingling of terror and agitation.\\n\\n“look, poirot!” i said.\\n\\nhe leant forward.\\n\\n“_tiens!_” he said. “it is mr. mace, from the chemist’s shop. he is\\ncoming here.”\\n\\nthe young man came to a halt before leastways cottage, and, after\\nhesitating a moment, pounded vigorously at the door.\\n\\n“a little minute,” cried poirot from the window. “i come.”\\n\\nmotioning to me to follow him, he ran swiftly down the stairs and\\nopened the door. mr. mace began at once.\\n\\n“oh, mr. poirot, i’m sorry for the inconvenience, but i heard that\\nyou’d just come back from the hall?”\\n\\n“yes, we have.”\\n\\nthe young man moistened his dry lips. his face was working curiously.\\n\\n“it’s all over the village about old mrs. inglethorp dying so suddenly.\\nthey do say—” he lowered his voice cautiously—“that it’s poison?”\\n\\npoirot’s face remained quite impassive.\\n\\n“only the doctors can tell us that, mr. mace.”\\n\\n“yes, exactly—of course——” the young man hesitated, and then his\\nagitation was too much for him. he clutched poirot by the arm, and sank\\nhis voice to a whisper: “just tell me this, mr. poirot, it isn’t—it\\nisn’t strychnine, is it?”\\n\\ni hardly heard what poirot replied. something evidently of a\\nnon-committal nature. the young man departed, and as he closed the door\\npoirot’s eyes met mine.\\n\\n“yes,” he said, nodding gravely. “he will have evidence to give at the\\ninquest.”\\n\\nwe went slowly upstairs again. i was opening my lips, when poirot\\nstopped me with a gesture of his hand.\\n\\n“not now, not now, _mon ami_. i have need of reflection. my mind is in\\nsome disorder—which is not well.”\\n\\nfor about ten minutes he sat in dead silence, perfectly still, except\\nfor several expressive motions of his eyebrows, and all the time his\\neyes grew steadily greener. at last he heaved a deep sigh.\\n\\n“it is well. the bad moment has passed. now all is arranged and\\nclassified. one must never permit confusion. the case is not clear\\nyet—no. for it is of the most complicated! it puzzles _me_. _me_,\\nhercule poirot! there are two facts of significance.”\\n\\n“and what are they?”\\n\\n“the first is the state of the weather yesterday. that is very\\nimportant.”\\n\\n“but it was a glorious day!” i interrupted. “poirot, you’re pulling my\\nleg!”\\n\\n“not at all. the thermometer registered 80 degrees in the shade. do not\\nforget that, my friend. it is the key to the whole riddle!”\\n\\n“and the second point?” i asked.\\n\\n“the important fact that monsieur inglethorp wears very peculiar\\nclothes, has a black beard, and uses glasses.”\\n\\n“poirot, i cannot believe you are serious.”\\n\\n“i am absolutely serious, my friend.”\\n\\n“but this is childish!”\\n\\n“no, it is very momentous.”\\n\\n“and supposing the coroner’s jury returns a verdict of wilful murder\\nagainst alfred inglethorp. what becomes of your theories, then?”\\n\\n“they would not be shaken because twelve stupid men had happened to\\nmake a mistake! but that will not occur. for one thing, a country jury\\nis not anxious to take responsibility upon itself, and mr. inglethorp\\nstands practically in the position of local squire. also,” he added\\nplacidly, “_i_ should not allow it!”\\n\\n“_you_ would not allow it?”\\n\\n“no.”\\n\\ni looked at the extraordinary little man, divided between annoyance and\\namusement. he was so tremendously sure of himself. as though he read my\\nthoughts, he nodded gently.\\n\\n“oh, yes, _mon ami_, i would do what i say.” he got up and laid his\\nhand on my shoulder. his physiognomy underwent a complete change. tears\\ncame into his eyes. “in all this, you see, i think of that poor mrs.\\ninglethorp who is dead. she was not extravagantly loved—no. but she was\\nvery good to us belgians—i owe her a debt.”\\n\\ni endeavoured to interrupt, but poirot swept on.\\n\\n“let me tell you this, hastings. she would never forgive me if i let\\nalfred inglethorp, her husband, be arrested _now_—when a word from me\\ncould save him!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter vi.\\nthe inquest\\n\\n\\nin the interval before the inquest, poirot was unfailing in his\\nactivity. twice he was closeted with mr. wells. he also took long walks\\ninto the country. i rather resented his not taking me into his\\nconfidence, the more so as i could not in the least guess what he was\\ndriving at.\\n\\nit occurred to me that he might have been making inquiries at raikes’s\\nfarm; so, finding him out when i called at leastways cottage on\\nwednesday evening, i walked over there by the fields, hoping to meet\\nhim. but there was no sign of him, and i hesitated to go right up to\\nthe farm itself. as i walked away, i met an aged rustic, who leered at\\nme cunningly.\\n\\n“you’m from the hall, bain’t you?” he asked.\\n\\n“yes. i’m looking for a friend of mine whom i thought might have walked\\nthis way.”\\n\\n“a little chap? as waves his hands when he talks? one of them belgies\\nfrom the village?”\\n\\n“yes,” i said eagerly. “he has been here, then?”\\n\\n“oh, ay, he’s been here, right enough. more’n once too. friend of\\nyours, is he? ah, you gentlemen from the hall—you’m a pretty lot!” and\\nhe leered more jocosely than ever.\\n\\n“why, do the gentlemen from the hall come here often?” i asked, as\\ncarelessly as i could.\\n\\nhe winked at me knowingly.\\n\\n“_one_ does, mister. naming no names, mind. and a very liberal\\ngentleman too! oh, thank you, sir, i’m sure.”\\n\\ni walked on sharply. evelyn howard had been right then, and i\\nexperienced a sharp twinge of disgust, as i thought of alfred\\ninglethorp’s liberality with another woman’s money. had that piquant\\ngipsy face been at the bottom of the crime, or was it the baser\\nmainspring of money? probably a judicious mixture of both.\\n\\non one point, poirot seemed to have a curious obsession. he once or\\ntwice observed to me that he thought dorcas must have made an error in\\nfixing the time of the quarrel. he suggested to her repeatedly that it\\nwas four-thirty, and not four o’clock when she had heard the voices.\\n\\nbut dorcas was unshaken. quite an hour, or even more, had elapsed\\nbetween the time when she had heard the voices and five o’clock, when\\nshe had taken tea to her mistress.\\n\\nthe inquest was held on friday at the stylites arms in the village.\\npoirot and i sat together, not being required to give evidence.\\n\\nthe preliminaries were gone through. the jury viewed the body, and john\\ncavendish gave evidence of identification.\\n\\nfurther questioned, he described his awakening in the early hours of\\nthe morning, and the circumstances of his mother’s death.\\n\\nthe medical evidence was next taken. there was a breathless hush, and\\nevery eye was fixed on the famous london specialist, who was known to\\nbe one of the greatest authorities of the day on the subject of\\ntoxicology.\\n\\nin a few brief words, he summed up the result of the post-mortem. shorn\\nof its medical phraseology and technicalities, it amounted to the fact\\nthat mrs. inglethorp had met her death as the result of strychnine\\npoisoning. judging from the quantity recovered, she must have taken not\\nless than three-quarters of a grain of strychnine, but probably one\\ngrain or slightly over.\\n\\n“is it possible that she could have swallowed the poison by accident?”\\nasked the coroner.\\n\\n“i should consider it very unlikely. strychnine is not used for\\ndomestic purposes, as some poisons are, and there are restrictions\\nplaced on its sale.”\\n\\n“does anything in your examination lead you to determine how the poison\\nwas administered?”\\n\\n“no.”\\n\\n“you arrived at styles before dr. wilkins, i believe?”\\n\\n“that is so. the motor met me just outside the lodge gates, and i\\nhurried there as fast as i could.”\\n\\n“will you relate to us exactly what happened next?”\\n\\n“i entered mrs. inglethorp’s room. she was at that moment in a typical\\ntetanic convulsion. she turned towards me, and gasped out:\\n‘alfred—alfred——’”\\n\\n“could the strychnine have been administered in mrs. inglethorp’s\\nafter-dinner coffee which was taken to her by her husband?”\\n\\n“possibly, but strychnine is a fairly rapid drug in its action. the\\nsymptoms appear from one to two hours after it has been swallowed. it\\nis retarded under certain conditions, none of which, however, appear to\\nhave been present in this case. i presume mrs. inglethorp took the\\ncoffee after dinner about eight o’clock, whereas the symptoms did not\\nmanifest themselves until the early hours of the morning, which, on the\\nface of it, points to the drug having been taken much later in the\\nevening.”\\n\\n“mrs. inglethorp was in the habit of drinking a cup of cocoa in the\\nmiddle of the night. could the strychnine have been administered in\\nthat?”\\n\\n“no, i myself took a sample of the cocoa remaining in the saucepan and\\nhad it analysed. there was no strychnine present.”\\n\\ni heard poirot chuckle softly beside me.\\n\\n“how did you know?” i whispered.\\n\\n“listen.”\\n\\n“i should say”—the doctor was continuing—“that i would have been\\nconsiderably surprised at any other result.”\\n\\n“why?”\\n\\n“simply because strychnine has an unusually bitter taste. it can be\\ndetected in a solution of one in seventy thousand, and can only be\\ndisguised by some strongly flavoured substance. cocoa would be quite\\npowerless to mask it.”\\n\\none of the jury wanted to know if the same objection applied to coffee.\\n\\n“no. coffee has a bitter taste of its own which would probably cover\\nthe taste of strychnine.”\\n\\n“then you consider it more likely that the drug was administered in the\\ncoffee, but that for some unknown reason its action was delayed.”\\n\\n“yes, but, the cup being completely smashed, there is no possibility of\\nanalyzing its contents.”\\n\\nthis concluded dr. bauerstein’s evidence. dr. wilkins corroborated it\\non all points. sounded as to the possibility of suicide, he repudiated\\nit utterly. the deceased, he said, suffered from a weak heart, but\\notherwise enjoyed perfect health, and was of a cheerful and\\nwell-balanced disposition. she would be one of the last people to take\\nher own life.\\n\\nlawrence cavendish was next called. his evidence was quite unimportant,\\nbeing a mere repetition of that of his brother. just as he was about to\\nstep down, he paused, and said rather hesitatingly:\\n\\n“i should like to make a suggestion if i may?”\\n\\nhe glanced deprecatingly at the coroner, who replied briskly:\\n\\n“certainly, mr. cavendish, we are here to arrive at the truth of this\\nmatter, and welcome anything that may lead to further elucidation.”\\n\\n“it is just an idea of mine,” explained lawrence. “of course i may be\\nquite wrong, but it still seems to me that my mother’s death might be\\naccounted for by natural means.”\\n\\n“how do you make that out, mr. cavendish?”\\n\\n“my mother, at the time of her death, and for some time before it, was\\ntaking a tonic containing strychnine.”\\n\\n“ah!” said the coroner.\\n\\nthe jury looked up, interested.\\n\\n“i believe,” continued lawrence, “that there have been cases where the\\ncumulative effect of a drug, administered for some time, has ended by\\ncausing death. also, is it not possible that she may have taken an\\noverdose of her medicine by accident?”\\n\\n“this is the first we have heard of the deceased taking strychnine at\\nthe time of her death. we are much obliged to you, mr. cavendish.”\\n\\ndr. wilkins was recalled and ridiculed the idea.\\n\\n“what mr. cavendish suggests is quite impossible. any doctor would tell\\nyou the same. strychnine is, in a certain sense, a cumulative poison,\\nbut it would be quite impossible for it to result in sudden death in\\nthis way. there would have to be a long period of chronic symptoms\\nwhich would at once have attracted my attention. the whole thing is\\nabsurd.”\\n\\n“and the second suggestion? that mrs. inglethorp may have inadvertently\\ntaken an overdose?”\\n\\n“three, or even four doses, would not have resulted in death. mrs.\\ninglethorp always had an extra large amount of medicine made up at a\\ntime, as she dealt with coot’s, the cash chemists in tadminster. she\\nwould have had to take very nearly the whole bottle to account for the\\namount of strychnine found at the post-mortem.”\\n\\n“then you consider that we may dismiss the tonic as not being in any\\nway instrumental in causing her death?”\\n\\n“certainly. the supposition is ridiculous.”\\n\\nthe same juryman who had interrupted before here suggested that the\\nchemist who made up the medicine might have committed an error.\\n\\n“that, of course, is always possible,” replied the doctor.\\n\\nbut dorcas, who was the next witness called, dispelled even that\\npossibility. the medicine had not been newly made up. on the contrary,\\nmrs. inglethorp had taken the last dose on the day of her death.\\n\\nso the question of the tonic was finally abandoned, and the coroner\\nproceeded with his task. having elicited from dorcas how she had been\\nawakened by the violent ringing of her mistress’s bell, and had\\nsubsequently roused the household, he passed to the subject of the\\nquarrel on the preceding afternoon.\\n\\ndorcas’s evidence on this point was substantially what poirot and i had\\nalready heard, so i will not repeat it here.\\n\\nthe next witness was mary cavendish. she stood very upright, and spoke\\nin a low, clear, and perfectly composed voice. in answer to the\\ncoroner’s question, she told how, her alarm clock having aroused her at\\nfour-thirty as usual, she was dressing, when she was startled by the\\nsound of something heavy falling.\\n\\n“that would have been the table by the bed?” commented the coroner.\\n\\n“i opened my door,” continued mary, “and listened. in a few minutes a\\nbell rang violently. dorcas came running down and woke my husband, and\\nwe all went to my mother-in-law’s room, but it was locked——”\\n\\nthe coroner interrupted her.\\n\\n“i really do not think we need trouble you further on that point. we\\nknow all that can be known of the subsequent happenings. but i should\\nbe obliged if you would tell us all you overheard of the quarrel the\\nday before.”\\n\\n“i?”\\n\\nthere was a faint insolence in her voice. she raised her hand and\\nadjusted the ruffle of lace at her neck, turning her head a little as\\nshe did so. and quite spontaneously the thought flashed across my mind:\\n“she is gaining time!”\\n\\n“yes. i understand,” continued the coroner deliberately, “that you were\\nsitting reading on the bench just outside the long window of the\\nboudoir. that is so, is it not?”\\n\\nthis was news to me and glancing sideways at poirot, i fancied that it\\nwas news to him as well.\\n\\nthere was the faintest pause, the mere hesitation of a moment, before\\nshe answered:\\n\\n“yes, that is so.”\\n\\n“and the boudoir window was open, was it not?”\\n\\nsurely her face grew a little paler as she answered:\\n\\n“yes.”\\n\\n“then you cannot have failed to hear the voices inside, especially as\\nthey were raised in anger. in fact, they would be more audible where\\nyou were than in the hall.”\\n\\n“possibly.”\\n\\n“will you repeat to us what you overheard of the quarrel?”\\n\\n“i really do not remember hearing anything.”\\n\\n“do you mean to say you did not hear voices?”\\n\\n“oh, yes, i heard the voices, but i did not hear what they said.” a\\nfaint spot of colour came into her cheek. “i am not in the habit of\\nlistening to private conversations.”\\n\\nthe coroner persisted.\\n\\n“and you remember nothing at all? _nothing_, mrs. cavendish? not one\\nstray word or phrase to make you realize that it _was_ a private\\nconversation?”\\n\\nshe paused, and seemed to reflect, still outwardly as calm as ever.\\n\\n“yes; i remember. mrs. inglethorp said something—i do not remember\\nexactly what—about causing scandal between husband and wife.”\\n\\n“ah!” the coroner leant back satisfied. “that corresponds with what\\ndorcas heard. but excuse me, mrs. cavendish, although you realized it\\nwas a private conversation, you did not move away? you remained where\\nyou were?”\\n\\ni caught the momentary gleam of her tawny eyes as she raised them. i\\nfelt certain that at that moment she would willingly have torn the\\nlittle lawyer, with his insinuations, into pieces, but she replied\\nquietly enough:\\n\\n“no. i was very comfortable where i was. i fixed my mind on my book.”\\n\\n“and that is all you can tell us?”\\n\\n“that is all.”\\n\\nthe examination was over, though i doubted if the coroner was entirely\\nsatisfied with it. i think he suspected that mary cavendish could tell\\nmore if she chose.\\n\\namy hill, shop assistant, was next called, and deposed to having sold a\\nwill form on the afternoon of the 17th to william earl, under-gardener\\nat styles.\\n\\nwilliam earl and manning succeeded her, and testified to witnessing a\\ndocument. manning fixed the time at about four-thirty, william was of\\nthe opinion that it was rather earlier.\\n\\ncynthia murdoch came next. she had, however, little to tell. she had\\nknown nothing of the tragedy, until awakened by mrs. cavendish.\\n\\n“you did not hear the table fall?”\\n\\n“no. i was fast asleep.”\\n\\nthe coroner smiled.\\n\\n“a good conscience makes a sound sleeper,” he observed. “thank you,\\nmiss murdoch, that is all.”\\n\\n“miss howard.”\\n\\nmiss howard produced the letter written to her by mrs. inglethorp on\\nthe evening of the 17th. poirot and i had, of course already seen it.\\nit added nothing to our knowledge of the tragedy. the following is a\\nfacsimile:\\n\\nstyles court\\nessex\\nhand written note:\\n\\n     july 17th\\n     my dear evelyn\\n     can we not bury\\n     the hachet? i have\\n     found it hard to forgive\\n     the things you said\\n     against my dear husband\\n     but i am an old woman\\n     & very fond of you\\n     yours affectionately,\\n    emily inglethorpe\\n\\n\\nit was handed to the jury who scrutinized it attentively.\\n\\n“i fear it does not help us much,” said the coroner, with a sigh.\\n“there is no mention of any of the events of that afternoon.”\\n\\n“plain as a pikestaff to me,” said miss howard shortly. “it shows\\nclearly enough that my poor old friend had just found out she’d been\\nmade a fool of!”\\n\\n“it says nothing of the kind in the letter,” the coroner pointed out.\\n\\n“no, because emily never could bear to put herself in the wrong. but\\n_i_ know her. she wanted me back. but she wasn’t going to own that i’d\\nbeen right. she went round about. most people do. don’t believe in it\\nmyself.”\\n\\nmr. wells smiled faintly. so, i noticed, did several of the jury. miss\\nhoward was obviously quite a public character.\\n\\n“anyway, all this tomfoolery is a great waste of time,” continued the\\nlady, glancing up and down the jury disparagingly. “talk—talk—talk!\\nwhen all the time we know perfectly well——”\\n\\nthe coroner interrupted her in an agony of apprehension:\\n\\n“thank you, miss howard, that is all.”\\n\\ni fancy he breathed a sigh of relief when she complied.\\n\\nthen came the sensation of the day. the coroner called albert mace,\\nchemist’s assistant.\\n\\nit was our agitated young man of the pale face. in answer to the\\ncoroner’s questions, he explained that he was a qualified pharmacist,\\nbut had only recently come to this particular shop, as the assistant\\nformerly there had just been called up for the army.\\n\\nthese preliminaries completed, the coroner proceeded to business.\\n\\n“mr. mace, have you lately sold strychnine to any unauthorized person?”\\n\\n“yes, sir.”\\n\\n“when was this?”\\n\\n“last monday night.”\\n\\n“monday? not tuesday?”\\n\\n“no, sir, monday, the 16th.”\\n\\n“will you tell us to whom you sold it?”\\n\\nyou could have heard a pin drop.\\n\\n“yes, sir. it was to mr. inglethorp.”\\n\\nevery eye turned simultaneously to where alfred inglethorp was sitting,\\nimpassive and wooden. he started slightly, as the damning words fell\\nfrom the young man’s lips. i half thought he was going to rise from his\\nchair, but he remained seated, although a remarkably well acted\\nexpression of astonishment rose on his face.\\n\\n“you are sure of what you say?” asked the coroner sternly.\\n\\n“quite sure, sir.”\\n\\n“are you in the habit of selling strychnine indiscriminately over the\\ncounter?”\\n\\nthe wretched young man wilted visibly under the coroner’s frown.\\n\\n“oh, no, sir—of course not. but, seeing it was mr. inglethorp of the\\nhall, i thought there was no harm in it. he said it was to poison a\\ndog.”\\n\\ninwardly i sympathized. it was only human nature to endeavour to please\\n“the hall”—especially when it might result in custom being transferred\\nfrom coot’s to the local establishment.\\n\\n“is it not customary for anyone purchasing poison to sign a book?”\\n\\n“yes, sir, mr. inglethorp did so.”\\n\\n“have you got the book here?”\\n\\n“yes, sir.”\\n\\nit was produced; and, with a few words of stern censure, the coroner\\ndismissed the wretched mr. mace.\\n\\nthen, amidst a breathless silence, alfred inglethorp was called. did he\\nrealize, i wondered, how closely the halter was being drawn around his\\nneck?\\n\\nthe coroner went straight to the point.\\n\\n“on monday evening last, did you purchase strychnine for the purpose of\\npoisoning a dog?”\\n\\ninglethorp replied with perfect calmness:\\n\\n“no, i did not. there is no dog at styles, except an outdoor sheepdog,\\nwhich is in perfect health.”\\n\\n“you deny absolutely having purchased strychnine from albert mace on\\nmonday last?”\\n\\n“i do.”\\n\\n“do you also deny _this_?”\\n\\nthe coroner handed him the register in which his signature was\\ninscribed.\\n\\n“certainly i do. the hand-writing is quite different from mine. i will\\nshow you.”\\n\\nhe took an old envelope out of his pocket, and wrote his name on it,\\nhanding it to the jury. it was certainly utterly dissimilar.\\n\\n“then what is your explanation of mr. mace’s statement?”\\n\\nalfred inglethorp replied imperturbably:\\n\\n“mr. mace must have been mistaken.”\\n\\nthe coroner hesitated for a moment, and then said:\\n\\n“mr. inglethorp, as a mere matter of form, would you mind telling us\\nwhere you were on the evening of monday, july 16th?”\\n\\n“really—i cannot remember.”\\n\\n“that is absurd, mr. inglethorp,” said the coroner sharply. “think\\nagain.”\\n\\ninglethorp shook his head.\\n\\n“i cannot tell you. i have an idea that i was out walking.”\\n\\n“in what direction?”\\n\\n“i really can’t remember.”\\n\\nthe coroner’s face grew graver.\\n\\n“were you in company with anyone?”\\n\\n“no.”\\n\\n“did you meet anyone on your walk?”\\n\\n“no.”\\n\\n“that is a pity,” said the coroner dryly. “i am to take it then that\\nyou decline to say where you were at the time that mr. mace positively\\nrecognized you as entering the shop to purchase strychnine?”\\n\\n“if you like to take it that way, yes.”\\n\\n“be careful, mr. inglethorp.”\\n\\npoirot was fidgeting nervously.\\n\\n“_sacré!_” he murmured. “does this imbecile of a man _want_ to be\\narrested?”\\n\\ninglethorp was indeed creating a bad impression. his futile denials\\nwould not have convinced a child. the coroner, however, passed briskly\\nto the next point, and poirot drew a deep breath of relief.\\n\\n“you had a discussion with your wife on tuesday afternoon?”\\n\\n“pardon me,” interrupted alfred inglethorp, “you have been misinformed.\\ni had no quarrel with my dear wife. the whole story is absolutely\\nuntrue. i was absent from the house the entire afternoon.”\\n\\n“have you anyone who can testify to that?”\\n\\n“you have my word,” said inglethorp haughtily.\\n\\nthe coroner did not trouble to reply.\\n\\n“there are two witnesses who will swear to having heard your\\ndisagreement with mrs. inglethorp.”\\n\\n“those witnesses were mistaken.”\\n\\ni was puzzled. the man spoke with such quiet assurance that i was\\nstaggered. i looked at poirot. there was an expression of exultation on\\nhis face which i could not understand. was he at last convinced of\\nalfred inglethorp’s guilt?\\n\\n“mr. inglethorp,” said the coroner, “you have heard your wife’s dying\\nwords repeated here. can you explain them in any way?”\\n\\n“certainly i can.”\\n\\n“you can?”\\n\\n“it seems to me very simple. the room was dimly lighted. dr. bauerstein\\nis much of my height and build, and, like me, wears a beard. in the dim\\nlight, and suffering as she was, my poor wife mistook him for me.”\\n\\n“ah!” murmured poirot to himself. “but it is an idea, that!”\\n\\n“you think it is true?” i whispered.\\n\\n“i do not say that. but it is truly an ingenious supposition.”\\n\\n“you read my wife’s last words as an accusation”—inglethorp was\\ncontinuing—“they were, on the contrary, an appeal to me.”\\n\\nthe coroner reflected a moment, then he said:\\n\\n“i believe, mr. inglethorp, that you yourself poured out the coffee,\\nand took it to your wife that evening?”\\n\\n“i poured it out, yes. but i did not take it to her. i meant to do so,\\nbut i was told that a friend was at the hall door, so i laid down the\\ncoffee on the hall table. when i came through the hall again a few\\nminutes later, it was gone.”\\n\\nthis statement might, or might not, be true, but it did not seem to me\\nto improve matters much for inglethorp. in any case, he had had ample\\ntime to introduce the poison.\\n\\nat that point, poirot nudged me gently, indicating two men who were\\nsitting together near the door. one was a little, sharp, dark,\\nferret-faced man, the other was tall and fair.\\n\\ni questioned poirot mutely. he put his lips to my ear.\\n\\n“do you know who that little man is?”\\n\\ni shook my head.\\n\\n“that is detective inspector james japp of scotland yard—jimmy japp.\\nthe other man is from scotland yard too. things are moving quickly, my\\nfriend.”\\n\\ni stared at the two men intently. there was certainly nothing of the\\npoliceman about them. i should never have suspected them of being\\nofficial personages.\\n\\ni was still staring, when i was startled and recalled by the verdict\\nbeing given:\\n\\n“wilful murder against some person or persons unknown.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter vii.\\npoirot pays his debts\\n\\n\\nas we came out of the stylites arms, poirot drew me aside by a gentle\\npressure of the arm. i understood his object. he was waiting for the\\nscotland yard men.\\n\\nin a few moments, they emerged, and poirot at once stepped forward, and\\naccosted the shorter of the two.\\n\\n“i fear you do not remember me, inspector japp.”\\n\\n“why, if it isn’t mr. poirot!” cried the inspector. he turned to the\\nother man. “you’ve heard me speak of mr. poirot? it was in 1904 he and\\ni worked together—the abercrombie forgery case—you remember, he was run\\ndown in brussels. ah, those were great days, moosier. then, do you\\nremember ‘baron’ altara? there was a pretty rogue for you! he eluded\\nthe clutches of half the police in europe. but we nailed him in\\nantwerp—thanks to mr. poirot here.”\\n\\nas these friendly reminiscences were being indulged in, i drew nearer,\\nand was introduced to detective-inspector japp, who, in his turn,\\nintroduced us both to his companion, superintendent summerhaye.\\n\\n“i need hardly ask what you are doing here, gentlemen,” remarked\\npoirot.\\n\\njapp closed one eye knowingly.\\n\\n“no, indeed. pretty clear case i should say.”\\n\\nbut poirot answered gravely:\\n\\n“there i differ from you.”\\n\\n“oh, come!” said summerhaye, opening his lips for the first time.\\n“surely the whole thing is clear as daylight. the man’s caught\\nred-handed. how he could be such a fool beats me!”\\n\\nbut japp was looking attentively at poirot.\\n\\n“hold your fire, summerhaye,” he remarked jocularly. “me and moosier\\nhere have met before—and there’s no man’s judgment i’d sooner take than\\nhis. if i’m not greatly mistaken, he’s got something up his sleeve.\\nisn’t that so, moosier?”\\n\\npoirot smiled.\\n\\n“i have drawn certain conclusions—yes.”\\n\\nsummerhaye was still looking rather sceptical, but japp continued his\\nscrutiny of poirot.\\n\\n“it’s this way,” he said, “so far, we’ve only seen the case from the\\noutside. that’s where the yard’s at a disadvantage in a case of this\\nkind, where the murder’s only out, so to speak, after the inquest. a\\nlot depends on being on the spot first thing, and that’s where mr.\\npoirot’s had the start of us. we shouldn’t have been here as soon as\\nthis even, if it hadn’t been for the fact that there was a smart doctor\\non the spot, who gave us the tip through the coroner. but you’ve been\\non the spot from the first, and you may have picked up some little\\nhints. from the evidence at the inquest, mr. inglethorp murdered his\\nwife as sure as i stand here, and if anyone but you hinted the contrary\\ni’d laugh in his face. i must say i was surprised the jury didn’t bring\\nit in wilful murder against him right off. i think they would have, if\\nit hadn’t been for the coroner—he seemed to be holding them back.”\\n\\n“perhaps, though, you have a warrant for his arrest in your pocket\\nnow,” suggested poirot.\\n\\na kind of wooden shutter of officialdom came down from japp’s\\nexpressive countenance.\\n\\n“perhaps i have, and perhaps i haven’t,” he remarked dryly.\\n\\npoirot looked at him thoughtfully.\\n\\n“i am very anxious, messieurs, that he should not be arrested.”\\n\\n“i dare say,” observed summerhaye sarcastically.\\n\\njapp was regarding poirot with comical perplexity.\\n\\n“can’t you go a little further, mr. poirot? a wink’s as good as a\\nnod—from you. you’ve been on the spot—and the yard doesn’t want to make\\nany mistakes, you know.”\\n\\npoirot nodded gravely.\\n\\n“that is exactly what i thought. well, i will tell you this. use your\\nwarrant: arrest mr. inglethorp. but it will bring you no kudos—the case\\nagainst him will be dismissed at once! _comme ça!_” and he snapped his\\nfingers expressively.\\n\\njapp’s face grew grave, though summerhaye gave an incredulous snort.\\n\\nas for me, i was literally dumb with astonishment. i could only\\nconclude that poirot was mad.\\n\\njapp had taken out a handkerchief, and was gently dabbing his brow.\\n\\n“i daren’t do it, mr. poirot. _i_’d take your word, but there’s others\\nover me who’ll be asking what the devil i mean by it. can’t you give me\\na little more to go on?”\\n\\npoirot reflected a moment.\\n\\n“it can be done,” he said at last. “i admit i do not wish it. it forces\\nmy hand. i would have preferred to work in the dark just for the\\npresent, but what you say is very just—the word of a belgian policeman,\\nwhose day is past, is not enough! and alfred inglethorp must not be\\narrested. that i have sworn, as my friend hastings here knows. see,\\nthen, my good japp, you go at once to styles?”\\n\\n“well, in about half an hour. we’re seeing the coroner and the doctor\\nfirst.”\\n\\n“good. call for me in passing—the last house in the village. i will go\\nwith you. at styles, mr. inglethorp will give you, or if he refuses—as\\nis probable—i will give you such proofs that shall satisfy you that the\\ncase against him could not possibly be sustained. is that a bargain?”\\n\\n“that’s a bargain,” said japp heartily. “and, on behalf of the yard,\\ni’m much obliged to you, though i’m bound to confess i can’t at present\\nsee the faintest possible loop-hole in the evidence, but you always\\nwere a marvel! so long, then, moosier.”\\n\\nthe two detectives strode away, summerhaye with an incredulous grin on\\nhis face.\\n\\n“well, my friend,” cried poirot, before i could get in a word, “what do\\nyou think? _mon dieu!_ i had some warm moments in that court; i did not\\nfigure to myself that the man would be so pig-headed as to refuse to\\nsay anything at all. decidedly, it was the policy of an imbecile.”\\n\\n“h’m! there are other explanations besides that of imbecility,” i\\nremarked. “for, if the case against him is true, how could he defend\\nhimself except by silence?”\\n\\n“why, in a thousand ingenious ways,” cried poirot. “see; say that it is\\ni who have committed this murder, i can think of seven most plausible\\nstories! far more convincing than mr. inglethorp’s stony denials!”\\n\\ni could not help laughing.\\n\\n“my dear poirot, i am sure you are capable of thinking of seventy! but,\\nseriously, in spite of what i heard you say to the detectives, you\\nsurely cannot still believe in the possibility of alfred inglethorp’s\\ninnocence?”\\n\\n“why not now as much as before? nothing has changed.”\\n\\n“but the evidence is so conclusive.”\\n\\n“yes, too conclusive.”\\n\\nwe turned in at the gate of leastways cottage, and proceeded up the now\\nfamiliar stairs.\\n\\n“yes, yes, too conclusive,” continued poirot, almost to himself. “real\\nevidence is usually vague and unsatisfactory. it has to be\\nexamined—sifted. but here the whole thing is cut and dried. no, my\\nfriend, this evidence has been very cleverly manufactured—so cleverly\\nthat it has defeated its own ends.”\\n\\n“how do you make that out?”\\n\\n“because, so long as the evidence against him was vague and intangible,\\nit was very hard to disprove. but, in his anxiety, the criminal has\\ndrawn the net so closely that one cut will set inglethorp free.”\\n\\ni was silent. and in a minute or two, poirot continued:\\n\\n“let us look at the matter like this. here is a man, let us say, who\\nsets out to poison his wife. he has lived by his wits as the saying\\ngoes. presumably, therefore, he has some wits. he is not altogether a\\nfool. well, how does he set about it? he goes boldly to the village\\nchemist’s and purchases strychnine under his own name, with a trumped\\nup story about a dog which is bound to be proved absurd. he does not\\nemploy the poison that night. no, he waits until he has had a violent\\nquarrel with her, of which the whole household is cognisant, and which\\nnaturally directs their suspicions upon him. he prepares no defence—no\\nshadow of an alibi, yet he knows the chemist’s assistant must\\nnecessarily come forward with the facts. bah! do not ask me to believe\\nthat any man could be so idiotic! only a lunatic, who wished to commit\\nsuicide by causing himself to be hanged, would act so!”\\n\\n“still—i do not see——” i began.\\n\\n“neither do i see. i tell you, _mon ami_, it puzzles me. _me_—hercule\\npoirot!”\\n\\n“but if you believe him innocent, how do you explain his buying the\\nstrychnine?”\\n\\n“very simply. he did _not_ buy it.”\\n\\n“but mace recognized him!”\\n\\n“i beg your pardon, he saw a man with a black beard like mr.\\ninglethorp’s, and wearing glasses like mr. inglethorp, and dressed in\\nmr. inglethorp’s rather noticeable clothes. he could not recognize a\\nman whom he had probably only seen in the distance, since, you\\nremember, he himself had only been in the village a fortnight, and mrs.\\ninglethorp dealt principally with coot’s in tadminster.”\\n\\n“then you think——”\\n\\n“_mon ami_, do you remember the two points i laid stress upon? leave\\nthe first one for the moment, what was the second?”\\n\\n“the important fact that alfred inglethorp wears peculiar clothes, has\\na black beard, and uses glasses,” i quoted.\\n\\n“exactly. now suppose anyone wished to pass himself off as john or\\nlawrence cavendish. would it be easy?”\\n\\n“no,” i said thoughtfully. “of course an actor——”\\n\\nbut poirot cut me short ruthlessly.\\n\\n“and why would it not be easy? i will tell you, my friend: because they\\nare both clean-shaven men. to make up successfully as one of these two\\nin broad daylight, it would need an actor of genius, and a certain\\ninitial facial resemblance. but in the case of alfred inglethorp, all\\nthat is changed. his clothes, his beard, the glasses which hide his\\neyes—those are the salient points about his personal appearance. now,\\nwhat is the first instinct of the criminal? to divert suspicion from\\nhimself, is it not so? and how can he best do that? by throwing it on\\nsomeone else. in this instance, there was a man ready to his hand.\\neverybody was predisposed to believe in mr. inglethorp’s guilt. it was\\na foregone conclusion that he would be suspected; but, to make it a\\nsure thing there must be tangible proof—such as the actual buying of\\nthe poison, and that, with a man of the peculiar appearance of mr.\\ninglethorp, was not difficult. remember, this young mace had never\\nactually spoken to mr. inglethorp. how should he doubt that the man in\\nhis clothes, with his beard and his glasses, was not alfred\\ninglethorp?”\\n\\n“it may be so,” i said, fascinated by poirot’s eloquence. “but, if that\\nwas the case, why does he not say where he was at six o’clock on monday\\nevening?”\\n\\n“ah, why indeed?” said poirot, calming down. “if he were arrested, he\\nprobably would speak, but i do not want it to come to that. i must make\\nhim see the gravity of his position. there is, of course, something\\ndiscreditable behind his silence. if he did not murder his wife, he is,\\nnevertheless, a scoundrel, and has something of his own to conceal,\\nquite apart from the murder.”\\n\\n“what can it be?” i mused, won over to poirot’s views for the moment,\\nalthough still retaining a faint conviction that the obvious deduction\\nwas the correct one.\\n\\n“can you not guess?” asked poirot, smiling.\\n\\n“no, can you?”\\n\\n“oh, yes, i had a little idea sometime ago—and it has turned out to be\\ncorrect.”\\n\\n“you never told me,” i said reproachfully.\\n\\npoirot spread out his hands apologetically.\\n\\n“pardon me, _mon ami_, you were not precisely _sympathique_.” he turned\\nto me earnestly. “tell me—you see now that he must not be arrested?”\\n\\n“perhaps,” i said doubtfully, for i was really quite indifferent to the\\nfate of alfred inglethorp, and thought that a good fright would do him\\nno harm.\\n\\npoirot, who was watching me intently, gave a sigh.\\n\\n“come, my friend,” he said, changing the subject, “apart from mr.\\ninglethorp, how did the evidence at the inquest strike you?”\\n\\n“oh, pretty much what i expected.”\\n\\n“did nothing strike you as peculiar about it?”\\n\\nmy thoughts flew to mary cavendish, and i hedged:\\n\\n“in what way?”\\n\\n“well, mr. lawrence cavendish’s evidence for instance?”\\n\\ni was relieved.\\n\\n“oh, lawrence! no, i don’t think so. he’s always a nervous chap.”\\n\\n“his suggestion that his mother might have been poisoned accidentally\\nby means of the tonic she was taking, that did not strike you as\\nstrange— _hein?_”\\n\\n“no, i can’t say it did. the doctors ridiculed it of course. but it was\\nquite a natural suggestion for a layman to make.”\\n\\n“but monsieur lawrence is not a layman. you told me yourself that he\\nhad started by studying medicine, and that he had taken his degree.”\\n\\n“yes, that’s true. i never thought of that.” i was rather startled. “it\\n_is_ odd.”\\n\\npoirot nodded.\\n\\n“from the first, his behaviour has been peculiar. of all the household,\\nhe alone would be likely to recognize the symptoms of strychnine\\npoisoning, and yet we find him the only member of the family to uphold\\nstrenuously the theory of death from natural causes. if it had been\\nmonsieur john, i could have understood it. he has no technical\\nknowledge, and is by nature unimaginative. but monsieur lawrence—no!\\nand now, to-day, he puts forward a suggestion that he himself must have\\nknown was ridiculous. there is food for thought in this, _mon ami!_”\\n\\n“it’s very confusing,” i agreed.\\n\\n“then there is mrs. cavendish,” continued poirot. “that’s another who\\nis not telling all she knows! what do you make of her attitude?”\\n\\n“i don’t know what to make of it. it seems inconceivable that she\\nshould be shielding alfred inglethorp. yet that is what it looks like.”\\n\\npoirot nodded reflectively.\\n\\n“yes, it is queer. one thing is certain, she overheard a good deal more\\nof that ‘private conversation’ than she was willing to admit.”\\n\\n“and yet she is the last person one would accuse of stooping to\\neavesdrop!”\\n\\n“exactly. one thing her evidence _has_ shown me. i made a mistake.\\ndorcas was quite right. the quarrel did take place earlier in the\\nafternoon, about four o’clock, as she said.”\\n\\ni looked at him curiously. i had never understood his insistence on\\nthat point.\\n\\n“yes, a good deal that was peculiar came out to-day,” continued poirot.\\n“dr. bauerstein, now, what was _he_ doing up and dressed at that hour\\nin the morning? it is astonishing to me that no one commented on the\\nfact.”\\n\\n“he has insomnia, i believe,” i said doubtfully.\\n\\n“which is a very good, or a very bad explanation,” remarked poirot. “it\\ncovers everything, and explains nothing. i shall keep my eye on our\\nclever dr. bauerstein.”\\n\\n“any more faults to find with the evidence?” i inquired satirically.\\n\\n“_mon ami_,” replied poirot gravely, “when you find that people are not\\ntelling you the truth—look out! now, unless i am much mistaken, at the\\ninquest to-day only one—at most, two persons were speaking the truth\\nwithout reservation or subterfuge.”\\n\\n“oh, come now, poirot! i won’t cite lawrence, or mrs. cavendish. but\\nthere’s john—and miss howard, surely they were speaking the truth?”\\n\\n“both of them, my friend? one, i grant you, but both——!”\\n\\nhis words gave me an unpleasant shock. miss howard’s evidence,\\nunimportant as it was, had been given in such a downright\\nstraightforward manner that it had never occurred to me to doubt her\\nsincerity. still, i had a great respect for poirot’s sagacity—except on\\nthe occasions when he was what i described to myself as “foolishly\\npig-headed.”\\n\\n“do you really think so?” i asked. “miss howard had always seemed to me\\nso essentially honest—almost uncomfortably so.”\\n\\npoirot gave me a curious look, which i could not quite fathom. he\\nseemed to speak, and then checked himself.\\n\\n“miss murdoch too,” i continued, “there’s nothing untruthful about\\n_her_.”\\n\\n“no. but it was strange that she never heard a sound, sleeping next\\ndoor; whereas mrs. cavendish, in the other wing of the building,\\ndistinctly heard the table fall.”\\n\\n“well, she’s young. and she sleeps soundly.”\\n\\n“ah, yes, indeed! she must be a famous sleeper, that one!”\\n\\ni did not quite like the tone of his voice, but at that moment a smart\\nknock reached our ears, and looking out of the window we perceived the\\ntwo detectives waiting for us below.\\n\\npoirot seized his hat, gave a ferocious twist to his moustache, and,\\ncarefully brushing an imaginary speck of dust from his sleeve, motioned\\nme to precede him down the stairs; there we joined the detectives and\\nset out for styles.\\n\\ni think the appearance of the two scotland yard men was rather a\\nshock—especially to john, though of course after the verdict, he had\\nrealized that it was only a matter of time. still, the presence of the\\ndetectives brought the truth home to him more than anything else could\\nhave done.\\n\\npoirot had conferred with japp in a low tone on the way up, and it was\\nthe latter functionary who requested that the household, with the\\nexception of the servants, should be assembled together in the\\ndrawing-room. i realized the significance of this. it was up to poirot\\nto make his boast good.\\n\\npersonally, i was not sanguine. poirot might have excellent reasons for\\nhis belief in inglethorp’s innocence, but a man of the type of\\nsummerhaye would require tangible proofs, and these i doubted if poirot\\ncould supply.\\n\\nbefore very long we had all trooped into the drawing-room, the door of\\nwhich japp closed. poirot politely set chairs for everyone. the\\nscotland yard men were the cynosure of all eyes. i think that for the\\nfirst time we realized that the thing was not a bad dream, but a\\ntangible reality. we had read of such things—now we ourselves were\\nactors in the drama. to-morrow the daily papers, all over england,\\nwould blazon out the news in staring headlines:\\n\\n“mysterious tragedy in essex”\\n\\n    “wealthy lady poisoned”\\n\\n\\nthere would be pictures of styles, snap-shots of “the family leaving\\nthe inquest”—the village photographer had not been idle! all the things\\nthat one had read a hundred times—things that happen to other people,\\nnot to oneself. and now, in this house, a murder had been committed. in\\nfront of us were “the detectives in charge of the case.” the well-known\\nglib phraseology passed rapidly through my mind in the interval before\\npoirot opened the proceedings.\\n\\ni think everyone was a little surprised that it should be he and not\\none of the official detectives who took the initiative.\\n\\n“_mesdames_ and _messieurs_,” said poirot, bowing as though he were a\\ncelebrity about to deliver a lecture, “i have asked you to come here\\nall together, for a certain object. that object, it concerns mr. alfred\\ninglethorp.”\\n\\ninglethorp was sitting a little by himself—i think, unconsciously,\\neveryone had drawn his chair slightly away from him—and he gave a faint\\nstart as poirot pronounced his name.\\n\\n“mr. inglethorp,” said poirot, addressing him directly, “a very dark\\nshadow is resting on this house—the shadow of murder.”\\n\\ninglethorp shook his head sadly.\\n\\n“my poor wife,” he murmured. “poor emily! it is terrible.”\\n\\n“i do not think, monsieur,” said poirot pointedly, “that you quite\\nrealize how terrible it may be—for you.” and as inglethorp did not\\nappear to understand, he added: “mr. inglethorp, you are standing in\\nvery grave danger.”\\n\\nthe two detectives fidgeted. i saw the official caution “anything you\\nsay will be used in evidence against you,” actually hovering on\\nsummerhaye’s lips. poirot went on.\\n\\n“do you understand now, monsieur?”\\n\\n“no. what do you mean?”\\n\\n“i mean,” said poirot deliberately, “that you are suspected of\\npoisoning your wife.”\\n\\na little gasp ran round the circle at this plain speaking.\\n\\n“good heavens!” cried inglethorp, starting up. “what a monstrous idea!\\n_i_—poison my dearest emily!”\\n\\n“i do not think”—poirot watched him narrowly—“that you quite realize\\nthe unfavourable nature of your evidence at the inquest. mr.\\ninglethorp, knowing what i have now told you, do you still refuse to\\nsay where you were at six o’clock on monday afternoon?”\\n\\nwith a groan, alfred inglethorp sank down again and buried his face in\\nhis hands. poirot approached and stood over him.\\n\\n“speak!” he cried menacingly.\\n\\nwith an effort, inglethorp raised his face from his hands. then, slowly\\nand deliberately, he shook his head.\\n\\n“you will not speak?”\\n\\n“no. i do not believe that anyone could be so monstrous as to accuse me\\nof what you say.”\\n\\npoirot nodded thoughtfully, like a man whose mind is made up.\\n\\n“_soit!_” he said. “then i must speak for you.”\\n\\nalfred inglethorp sprang up again.\\n\\n“you? how can you speak? you do not know——” he broke off abruptly.\\n\\npoirot turned to face us. “_mesdames_ and _messieurs_! i speak! listen!\\ni, hercule poirot, affirm that the man who entered the chemist’s shop,\\nand purchased strychnine at six o’clock on monday last was not mr.\\ninglethorp, for at six o’clock on that day mr. inglethorp was escorting\\nmrs. raikes back to her home from a neighbouring farm. i can produce no\\nless than five witnesses to swear to having seen them together, either\\nat six or just after and, as you may know, the abbey farm, mrs.\\nraikes’s home, is at least two and a half miles distant from the\\nvillage. there is absolutely no question as to the alibi!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter viii.\\nfresh suspicions\\n\\n\\nthere was a moment’s stupefied silence. japp, who was the least\\nsurprised of any of us, was the first to speak.\\n\\n“my word,” he cried, “you’re the goods! and no mistake, mr. poirot!\\nthese witnesses of yours are all right, i suppose?”\\n\\n“_voilà!_ i have prepared a list of them—names and addresses. you must\\nsee them, of course. but you will find it all right.”\\n\\n“i’m sure of that.” japp lowered his voice. “i’m much obliged to you. a\\npretty mare’s nest arresting him would have been.” he turned to\\ninglethorp. “but, if you’ll excuse me, sir, why couldn’t you say all\\nthis at the inquest?”\\n\\n“i will tell you why,” interrupted poirot. “there was a certain\\nrumour——”\\n\\n“a most malicious and utterly untrue one,” interrupted alfred\\ninglethorp in an agitated voice.\\n\\n“and mr. inglethorp was anxious to have no scandal revived just at\\npresent. am i right?”\\n\\n“quite right.” inglethorp nodded. “with my poor emily not yet buried,\\ncan you wonder i was anxious that no more lying rumours should be\\nstarted.”\\n\\n“between you and me, sir,” remarked japp, “i’d sooner have any amount\\nof rumours than be arrested for murder. and i venture to think your\\npoor lady would have felt the same. and, if it hadn’t been for mr.\\npoirot here, arrested you would have been, as sure as eggs is eggs!”\\n\\n“i was foolish, no doubt,” murmured inglethorp. “but you do not know,\\ninspector, how i have been persecuted and maligned.” and he shot a\\nbaleful glance at evelyn howard.\\n\\n“now, sir,” said japp, turning briskly to john, “i should like to see\\nthe lady’s bedroom, please, and after that i’ll have a little chat with\\nthe servants. don’t you bother about anything. mr. poirot, here, will\\nshow me the way.”\\n\\nas they all went out of the room, poirot turned and made me a sign to\\nfollow him upstairs. there he caught me by the arm, and drew me aside.\\n\\n“quick, go to the other wing. stand there—just this side of the baize\\ndoor. do not move till i come.” then, turning rapidly, he rejoined the\\ntwo detectives.\\n\\ni followed his instructions, taking up my position by the baize door,\\nand wondering what on earth lay behind the request. why was i to stand\\nin this particular spot on guard? i looked thoughtfully down the\\ncorridor in front of me. an idea struck me. with the exception of\\ncynthia murdoch’s, everyone’s room was in this left wing. had that\\nanything to do with it? was i to report who came or went? i stood\\nfaithfully at my post. the minutes passed. nobody came. nothing\\nhappened.\\n\\nit must have been quite twenty minutes before poirot rejoined me.\\n\\n“you have not stirred?”\\n\\n“no, i’ve stuck here like a rock. nothing’s happened.”\\n\\n“ah!” was he pleased, or disappointed? “you’ve seen nothing at all?”\\n\\n“no.”\\n\\n“but you have probably heard something? a big bump—eh, _mon ami?_”\\n\\n“no.”\\n\\n“is it possible? ah, but i am vexed with myself! i am not usually\\nclumsy. i made but a slight gesture”—i know poirot’s gestures—“with the\\nleft hand, and over went the table by the bed!”\\n\\nhe looked so childishly vexed and crest-fallen that i hastened to\\nconsole him.\\n\\n“never mind, old chap. what does it matter? your triumph downstairs\\nexcited you. i can tell you, that was a surprise to us all. there must\\nbe more in this affair of inglethorp’s with mrs. raikes than we\\nthought, to make him hold his tongue so persistently. what are you\\ngoing to do now? where are the scotland yard fellows?”\\n\\n“gone down to interview the servants. i showed them all our exhibits. i\\nam disappointed in japp. he has no method!”\\n\\n“hullo!” i said, looking out of the window. “here’s dr. bauerstein. i\\nbelieve you’re right about that man, poirot. i don’t like him.”\\n\\n“he is clever,” observed poirot meditatively.\\n\\n“oh, clever as the devil! i must say i was overjoyed to see him in the\\nplight he was in on tuesday. you never saw such a spectacle!” and i\\ndescribed the doctor’s adventure. “he looked a regular scarecrow!\\nplastered with mud from head to foot.”\\n\\n“you saw him, then?”\\n\\n“yes. of course, he didn’t want to come in—it was just after dinner—but\\nmr. inglethorp insisted.”\\n\\n“what?” poirot caught me violently by the shoulders. “was dr.\\nbauerstein here on tuesday evening? here? and you never told me? why\\ndid you not tell me? why? why?”\\n\\nhe appeared to be in an absolute frenzy.\\n\\n“my dear poirot,” i expostulated, “i never thought it would interest\\nyou. i didn’t know it was of any importance.”\\n\\n“importance? it is of the first importance! so dr. bauerstein was here\\non tuesday night—the night of the murder. hastings, do you not see?\\nthat alters everything—everything!”\\n\\ni had never seen him so upset. loosening his hold of me, he\\nmechanically straightened a pair of candlesticks, still murmuring to\\nhimself: “yes, that alters everything—everything.”\\n\\nsuddenly he seemed to come to a decision.\\n\\n“_allons!_” he said. “we must act at once. where is mr. cavendish?”\\n\\njohn was in the smoking-room. poirot went straight to him.\\n\\n“mr. cavendish, i have some important business in tadminster. a new\\nclue. may i take your motor?”\\n\\n“why, of course. do you mean at once?”\\n\\n“if you please.”\\n\\njohn rang the bell, and ordered round the car. in another ten minutes,\\nwe were racing down the park and along the high road to tadminster.\\n\\n“now, poirot,” i remarked resignedly, “perhaps you will tell me what\\nall this is about?”\\n\\n“well, _mon ami_, a good deal you can guess for yourself. of course you\\nrealize that, now mr. inglethorp is out of it, the whole position is\\ngreatly changed. we are face to face with an entirely new problem. we\\nknow now that there is one person who did not buy the poison. we have\\ncleared away the manufactured clues. now for the real ones. i have\\nascertained that anyone in the household, with the exception of mrs.\\ncavendish, who was playing tennis with you, could have personated mr.\\ninglethorp on monday evening. in the same way, we have his statement\\nthat he put the coffee down in the hall. no one took much notice of\\nthat at the inquest—but now it has a very different significance. we\\nmust find out who did take that coffee to mrs. inglethorp eventually,\\nor who passed through the hall whilst it was standing there. from your\\naccount, there are only two people whom we can positively say did not\\ngo near the coffee—mrs. cavendish, and mademoiselle cynthia.”\\n\\n“yes, that is so.” i felt an inexpressible lightening of the heart.\\nmary cavendish could certainly not rest under suspicion.\\n\\n“in clearing alfred inglethorp,” continued poirot, “i have been obliged\\nto show my hand sooner than i intended. as long as i might be thought\\nto be pursuing him, the criminal would be off his guard. now, he will\\nbe doubly careful. yes—doubly careful.” he turned to me abruptly. “tell\\nme, hastings, you yourself—have you no suspicions of anybody?”\\n\\ni hesitated. to tell the truth, an idea, wild and extravagant in\\nitself, had once or twice that morning flashed through my brain. i had\\nrejected it as absurd, nevertheless it persisted.\\n\\n“you couldn’t call it a suspicion,” i murmured. “it’s so utterly\\nfoolish.”\\n\\n“come now,” urged poirot encouragingly. “do not fear. speak your mind.\\nyou should always pay attention to your instincts.”\\n\\n“well then,” i blurted out, “it’s absurd—but i suspect miss howard of\\nnot telling all she knows!”\\n\\n“miss howard?”\\n\\n“yes—you’ll laugh at me——”\\n\\n“not at all. why should i?”\\n\\n“i can’t help feeling,” i continued blunderingly; “that we’ve rather\\nleft her out of the possible suspects, simply on the strength of her\\nhaving been away from the place. but, after all, she was only fifteen\\nmiles away. a car would do it in half an hour. can we say positively\\nthat she was away from styles on the night of the murder?”\\n\\n“yes, my friend,” said poirot unexpectedly, “we can. one of my first\\nactions was to ring up the hospital where she was working.”\\n\\n“well?”\\n\\n“well, i learnt that miss howard had been on afternoon duty on tuesday,\\nand that—a convoy coming in unexpectedly—she had kindly offered to\\nremain on night duty, which offer was gratefully accepted. that\\ndisposes of that.”\\n\\n“oh!” i said, rather nonplussed. “really,” i continued, “it’s her\\nextraordinary vehemence against inglethorp that started me off\\nsuspecting her. i can’t help feeling she’d do anything against him. and\\ni had an idea she might know something about the destroying of the\\nwill. she might have burnt the new one, mistaking it for the earlier\\none in his favour. she is so terribly bitter against him.”\\n\\n“you consider her vehemence unnatural?”\\n\\n“y—es. she is so very violent. i wondered really whether she is quite\\nsane on that point.”\\n\\npoirot shook his head energetically.\\n\\n“no, no, you are on a wrong tack there. there is nothing weak-minded or\\ndegenerate about miss howard. she is an excellent specimen of\\nwell-balanced english beef and brawn. she is sanity itself.”\\n\\n“yet her hatred of inglethorp seems almost a mania. my idea was—a very\\nridiculous one, no doubt—that she had intended to poison him—and that,\\nin some way, mrs. inglethorp got hold of it by mistake. but i don’t at\\nall see how it could have been done. the whole thing is absurd and\\nridiculous to the last degree.”\\n\\n“still you are right in one thing. it is always wise to suspect\\neverybody until you can prove logically, and to your own satisfaction,\\nthat they are innocent. now, what reasons are there against miss\\nhoward’s having deliberately poisoned mrs. inglethorp?”\\n\\n“why, she was devoted to her!” i exclaimed.\\n\\n“tcha! tcha!” cried poirot irritably. “you argue like a child. if miss\\nhoward were capable of poisoning the old lady, she would be quite\\nequally capable of simulating devotion. no, we must look elsewhere. you\\nare perfectly correct in your assumption that her vehemence against\\nalfred inglethorp is too violent to be natural; but you are quite wrong\\nin the deduction you draw from it. i have drawn my own deductions,\\nwhich i believe to be correct, but i will not speak of them at\\npresent.” he paused a minute, then went on. “now, to my way of\\nthinking, there is one insuperable objection to miss howard’s being the\\nmurderess.”\\n\\n“and that is?”\\n\\n“that in no possible way could mrs. inglethorp’s death benefit miss\\nhoward. now there is no murder without a motive.”\\n\\ni reflected.\\n\\n“could not mrs. inglethorp have made a will in her favour?”\\n\\npoirot shook his head.\\n\\n“but you yourself suggested that possibility to mr. wells?”\\n\\npoirot smiled.\\n\\n“that was for a reason. i did not want to mention the name of the\\nperson who was actually in my mind. miss howard occupied very much the\\nsame position, so i used her name instead.”\\n\\n“still, mrs. inglethorp might have done so. why, that will, made on the\\nafternoon of her death may——”\\n\\nbut poirot’s shake of the head was so energetic that i stopped.\\n\\n“no, my friend. i have certain little ideas of my own about that will.\\nbut i can tell you this much—it was not in miss howard’s favour.”\\n\\ni accepted his assurance, though i did not really see how he could be\\nso positive about the matter.\\n\\n“well,” i said, with a sigh, “we will acquit miss howard, then. it is\\npartly your fault that i ever came to suspect her. it was what you said\\nabout her evidence at the inquest that set me off.”\\n\\npoirot looked puzzled.\\n\\n“what did i say about her evidence at the inquest?”\\n\\n“don’t you remember? when i cited her and john cavendish as being above\\nsuspicion?”\\n\\n“oh—ah—yes.” he seemed a little confused, but recovered himself. “by\\nthe way, hastings, there is something i want you to do for me.”\\n\\n“certainly. what is it?”\\n\\n“next time you happen to be alone with lawrence cavendish, i want you\\nto say this to him. ‘i have a message for you, from poirot. he says:\\n“find the extra coffee-cup, and you can rest in peace!”’ nothing more.\\nnothing less.”\\n\\n“‘find the extra coffee-cup, and you can rest in peace.’ is that\\nright?” i asked, much mystified.\\n\\n“excellent.”\\n\\n“but what does it mean?”\\n\\n“ah, that i will leave you to find out. you have access to the facts.\\njust say that to him, and see what he says.”\\n\\n“very well—but it’s all extremely mysterious.”\\n\\nwe were running into tadminster now, and poirot directed the car to the\\n“analytical chemist.”\\n\\npoirot hopped down briskly, and went inside. in a few minutes he was\\nback again.\\n\\n“there,” he said. “that is all my business.”\\n\\n“what were you doing there?” i asked, in lively curiosity.\\n\\n“i left something to be analysed.”\\n\\n“yes, but what?”\\n\\n“the sample of cocoa i took from the saucepan in the bedroom.”\\n\\n“but that has already been tested!” i cried, stupefied. “dr. bauerstein\\nhad it tested, and you yourself laughed at the possibility of there\\nbeing strychnine in it.”\\n\\n“i know dr. bauerstein had it tested,” replied poirot quietly.\\n\\n“well, then?”\\n\\n“well, i have a fancy for having it analysed again, that is all.”\\n\\nand not another word on the subject could i drag out of him.\\n\\nthis proceeding of poirot’s, in respect of the cocoa, puzzled me\\nintensely. i could see neither rhyme nor reason in it. however, my\\nconfidence in him, which at one time had rather waned, was fully\\nrestored since his belief in alfred inglethorp’s innocence had been so\\ntriumphantly vindicated.\\n\\nthe funeral of mrs. inglethorp took place the following day, and on\\nmonday, as i came down to a late breakfast, john drew me aside, and\\ninformed me that mr. inglethorp was leaving that morning, to take up\\nhis quarters at the stylites arms until he should have completed his\\nplans.\\n\\n“and really it’s a great relief to think he’s going, hastings,”\\ncontinued my honest friend. “it was bad enough before, when we thought\\nhe’d done it, but i’m hanged if it isn’t worse now, when we all feel\\nguilty for having been so down on the fellow. the fact is, we’ve\\ntreated him abominably. of course, things did look black against him. i\\ndon’t see how anyone could blame us for jumping to the conclusions we\\ndid. still, there it is, we were in the wrong, and now there’s a\\nbeastly feeling that one ought to make amends; which is difficult, when\\none doesn’t like the fellow a bit better than one did before. the whole\\nthing’s damned awkward! and i’m thankful he’s had the tact to take\\nhimself off. it’s a good thing styles wasn’t the mater’s to leave to\\nhim. couldn’t bear to think of the fellow lording it here. he’s welcome\\nto her money.”\\n\\n“you’ll be able to keep up the place all right?” i asked.\\n\\n“oh, yes. there are the death duties, of course, but half my father’s\\nmoney goes with the place, and lawrence will stay with us for the\\npresent, so there is his share as well. we shall be pinched at first,\\nof course, because, as i once told you, i am in a bit of a hole\\nfinancially myself. still, the johnnies will wait now.”\\n\\nin the general relief at inglethorp’s approaching departure, we had the\\nmost genial breakfast we had experienced since the tragedy. cynthia,\\nwhose young spirits were naturally buoyant, was looking quite her\\npretty self again, and we all, with the exception of lawrence, who\\nseemed unalterably gloomy and nervous, were quietly cheerful, at the\\nopening of a new and hopeful future.\\n\\nthe papers, of course, had been full of the tragedy. glaring headlines,\\nsandwiched biographies of every member of the household, subtle\\ninnuendoes, the usual familiar tag about the police having a clue.\\nnothing was spared us. it was a slack time. the war was momentarily\\ninactive, and the newspapers seized with avidity on this crime in\\nfashionable life: “the mysterious affair at styles” was the topic of\\nthe moment.\\n\\nnaturally it was very annoying for the cavendishes. the house was\\nconstantly besieged by reporters, who were consistently denied\\nadmission, but who continued to haunt the village and the grounds,\\nwhere they lay in wait with cameras, for any unwary members of the\\nhousehold. we all lived in a blast of publicity. the scotland yard men\\ncame and went, examining, questioning, lynx-eyed and reserved of\\ntongue. towards what end they were working, we did not know. had they\\nany clue, or would the whole thing remain in the category of\\nundiscovered crimes?\\n\\nafter breakfast, dorcas came up to me rather mysteriously, and asked if\\nshe might have a few words with me.\\n\\n“certainly. what is it, dorcas?”\\n\\n“well, it’s just this, sir. you’ll be seeing the belgian gentleman\\nto-day perhaps?” i nodded. “well, sir, you know how he asked me so\\nparticular if the mistress, or anyone else, had a green dress?”\\n\\n“yes, yes. you have found one?” my interest was aroused.\\n\\n“no, not that, sir. but since then i’ve remembered what the young\\ngentlemen”—john and lawrence were still the “young gentlemen” to\\ndorcas—“call the ‘dressing-up box.’ it’s up in the front attic, sir. a\\ngreat chest, full of old clothes and fancy dresses, and what not. and\\nit came to me sudden like that there might be a green dress amongst\\nthem. so, if you’d tell the belgian gentleman——”\\n\\n“i will tell him, dorcas,” i promised.\\n\\n“thank you very much, sir. a very nice gentleman he is, sir. and quite\\na different class from them two detectives from london, what goes\\nprying about, and asking questions. i don’t hold with foreigners as a\\nrule, but from what the newspapers say i make out as how these brave\\nbelges isn’t the ordinary run of foreigners, and certainly he’s a most\\npolite spoken gentleman.”\\n\\ndear old dorcas! as she stood there, with her honest face upturned to\\nmine, i thought what a fine specimen she was of the old-fashioned\\nservant that is so fast dying out.\\n\\ni thought i might as well go down to the village at once, and look up\\npoirot; but i met him half-way, coming up to the house, and at once\\ngave him dorcas’s message.\\n\\n“ah, the brave dorcas! we will look at the chest, although—but no\\nmatter—we will examine it all the same.”\\n\\nwe entered the house by one of the windows. there was no one in the\\nhall, and we went straight up to the attic.\\n\\nsure enough, there was the chest, a fine old piece, all studded with\\nbrass nails, and full to overflowing with every imaginable type of\\ngarment.\\n\\npoirot bundled everything out on the floor with scant ceremony. there\\nwere one or two green fabrics of varying shades; but poirot shook his\\nhead over them all. he seemed somewhat apathetic in the search, as\\nthough he expected no great results from it. suddenly he gave an\\nexclamation.\\n\\n“what is it?”\\n\\n“look!”\\n\\nthe chest was nearly empty, and there, reposing right at the bottom,\\nwas a magnificent black beard.\\n\\n“_ohó!_” said poirot. “_ohó!_” he turned it over in his hands,\\nexamining it closely. “new,” he remarked. “yes, quite new.”\\n\\nafter a moment’s hesitation, he replaced it in the chest, heaped all\\nthe other things on top of it as before, and made his way briskly\\ndownstairs. he went straight to the pantry, where we found dorcas\\nbusily polishing her silver.\\n\\npoirot wished her good morning with gallic politeness, and went on:\\n\\n“we have been looking through that chest, dorcas. i am much obliged to\\nyou for mentioning it. there is, indeed, a fine collection there. are\\nthey often used, may i ask?”\\n\\n“well, sir, not very often nowadays, though from time to time we do\\nhave what the young gentlemen call ‘a dress-up night.’ and very funny\\nit is sometimes, sir. mr. lawrence, he’s wonderful. most comic! i shall\\nnever forget the night he came down as the char of persia, i think he\\ncalled it—a sort of eastern king it was. he had the big paper knife in\\nhis hand, and ‘mind, dorcas,’ he says, ‘you’ll have to be very\\nrespectful. this is my specially sharpened scimitar, and it’s off with\\nyour head if i’m at all displeased with you!’ miss cynthia, she was\\nwhat they call an apache, or some such name—a frenchified sort of\\ncut-throat, i take it to be. a real sight she looked. you’d never have\\nbelieved a pretty young lady like that could have made herself into\\nsuch a ruffian. nobody would have known her.”\\n\\n“these evenings must have been great fun,” said poirot genially. “i\\nsuppose mr. lawrence wore that fine black beard in the chest upstairs,\\nwhen he was shah of persia?”\\n\\n“he did have a beard, sir,” replied dorcas, smiling. “and well i know\\nit, for he borrowed two skeins of my black wool to make it with! and\\ni’m sure it looked wonderfully natural at a distance. i didn’t know as\\nthere was a beard up there at all. it must have been got quite lately,\\ni think. there was a red wig, i know, but nothing else in the way of\\nhair. burnt corks they use mostly—though ‘tis messy getting it off\\nagain. miss cynthia was a nigger once, and, oh, the trouble she had.”\\n\\n“so dorcas knows nothing about that black beard,” said poirot\\nthoughtfully, as we walked out into the hall again.\\n\\n“do you think it is _the_ one?” i whispered eagerly.\\n\\npoirot nodded.\\n\\n“i do. you notice it had been trimmed?”\\n\\n“no.”\\n\\n“yes. it was cut exactly the shape of mr. inglethorp’s, and i found one\\nor two snipped hairs. hastings, this affair is very deep.”\\n\\n“who put it in the chest, i wonder?”\\n\\n“someone with a good deal of intelligence,” remarked poirot dryly. “you\\nrealize that he chose the one place in the house to hide it where its\\npresence would not be remarked? yes, he is intelligent. but we must be\\nmore intelligent. we must be so intelligent that he does not suspect us\\nof being intelligent at all.”\\n\\ni acquiesced.\\n\\n“there, _mon ami_, you will be of great assistance to me.”\\n\\ni was pleased with the compliment. there had been times when i hardly\\nthought that poirot appreciated me at my true worth.\\n\\n“yes,” he continued, staring at me thoughtfully, “you will be\\ninvaluable.”\\n\\nthis was naturally gratifying, but poirot’s next words were not so\\nwelcome.\\n\\n“i must have an ally in the house,” he observed reflectively.\\n\\n“you have me,” i protested.\\n\\n“true, but you are not sufficient.”\\n\\ni was hurt, and showed it. poirot hurried to explain himself.\\n\\n“you do not quite take my meaning. you are known to be working with me.\\ni want somebody who is not associated with us in any way.”\\n\\n“oh, i see. how about john?”\\n\\n“no, i think not.”\\n\\n“the dear fellow isn’t perhaps very bright,” i said thoughtfully.\\n\\n“here comes miss howard,” said poirot suddenly. “she is the very\\nperson. but i am in her black books, since i cleared mr. inglethorp.\\nstill, we can but try.”\\n\\nwith a nod that was barely civil, miss howard assented to poirot’s\\nrequest for a few minutes’ conversation.\\n\\nwe went into the little morning-room, and poirot closed the door.\\n\\n“well, monsieur poirot,” said miss howard impatiently, “what is it? out\\nwith it. i’m busy.”\\n\\n“do you remember, mademoiselle, that i once asked you to help me?”\\n\\n“yes, i do.” the lady nodded. “and i told you i’d help you with\\npleasure—to hang alfred inglethorp.”\\n\\n“ah!” poirot studied her seriously. “miss howard, i will ask you one\\nquestion. i beg of you to reply to it truthfully.”\\n\\n“never tell lies,” replied miss howard.\\n\\n“it is this. do you still believe that mrs. inglethorp was poisoned by\\nher husband?”\\n\\n“what do you mean?” she asked sharply. “you needn’t think your pretty\\nexplanations influence me in the slightest. i’ll admit that it wasn’t\\nhe who bought strychnine at the chemist’s shop. what of that? i dare\\nsay he soaked fly paper, as i told you at the beginning.”\\n\\n“that is arsenic—not strychnine,” said poirot mildly.\\n\\n“what does that matter? arsenic would put poor emily out of the way\\njust as well as strychnine. if i’m convinced he did it, it doesn’t\\nmatter a jot to me _how_ he did it.”\\n\\n“exactly. _if_ you are convinced he did it,” said poirot quietly. “i\\nwill put my question in another form. did you ever in your heart of\\nhearts believe that mrs. inglethorp was poisoned by her husband?”\\n\\n“good heavens!” cried miss howard. “haven’t i always told you the man\\nis a villain? haven’t i always told you he would murder her in her bed?\\nhaven’t i always hated him like poison?”\\n\\n“exactly,” said poirot. “that bears out my little idea entirely.”\\n\\n“what little idea?”\\n\\n“miss howard, do you remember a conversation that took place on the day\\nof my friend’s arrival here? he repeated it to me, and there is a\\nsentence of yours that has impressed me very much. do you remember\\naffirming that if a crime had been committed, and anyone you loved had\\nbeen murdered, you felt certain that you would know by instinct who the\\ncriminal was, even if you were quite unable to prove it?”\\n\\n“yes, i remember saying that. i believe it too. i suppose you think it\\nnonsense?”\\n\\n“not at all.”\\n\\n“and yet you will pay no attention to my instinct against alfred\\ninglethorp.”\\n\\n“no,” said poirot curtly. “because your instinct is not against mr.\\ninglethorp.”\\n\\n“what?”\\n\\n“no. you wish to believe he committed the crime. you believe him\\ncapable of committing it. but your instinct tells you he did not commit\\nit. it tells you more—shall i go on?”\\n\\nshe was staring at him, fascinated, and made a slight affirmative\\nmovement of the hand.\\n\\n“shall i tell you why you have been so vehement against mr. inglethorp?\\nit is because you have been trying to believe what you wish to believe.\\nit is because you are trying to drown and stifle your instinct, which\\ntells you another name——”\\n\\n“no, no, no!” cried miss howard wildly, flinging up her hands. “don’t\\nsay it! oh, don’t say it! it isn’t true! it can’t be true. i don’t know\\nwhat put such a wild—such a dreadful—idea into my head!”\\n\\n“i am right, am i not?” asked poirot.\\n\\n“yes, yes; you must be a wizard to have guessed. but it can’t be\\nso—it’s too monstrous, too impossible. it _must_ be alfred inglethorp.”\\n\\npoirot shook his head gravely.\\n\\n“don’t ask me about it,” continued miss howard, “because i shan’t tell\\nyou. i won’t admit it, even to myself. i must be mad to think of such a\\nthing.”\\n\\npoirot nodded, as if satisfied.\\n\\n“i will ask you nothing. it is enough for me that it is as i thought.\\nand i—i, too, have an instinct. we are working together towards a\\ncommon end.”\\n\\n“don’t ask me to help you, because i won’t. i wouldn’t lift a finger\\nto—to——” she faltered.\\n\\n“you will help me in spite of yourself. i ask you nothing—but you will\\nbe my ally. you will not be able to help yourself. you will do the only\\nthing that i want of you.”\\n\\n“and that is?”\\n\\n“you will watch!”\\n\\nevelyn howard bowed her head.\\n\\n“yes, i can’t help doing that. i am always watching—always hoping i\\nshall be proved wrong.”\\n\\n“if we are wrong, well and good,” said poirot. “no one will be more\\npleased than i shall. but, if we are right? if we are right, miss\\nhoward, on whose side are you then?”\\n\\n“i don’t know, i don’t know——”\\n\\n“come now.”\\n\\n“it could be hushed up.”\\n\\n“there must be no hushing up.”\\n\\n“but emily herself——” she broke off.\\n\\n“miss howard,” said poirot gravely, “this is unworthy of you.”\\n\\nsuddenly she took her face from her hands.\\n\\n“yes,” she said quietly, “that was not evelyn howard who spoke!” she\\nflung her head up proudly. “_this_ is evelyn howard! and she is on the\\nside of justice! let the cost be what it may.” and with these words,\\nshe walked firmly out of the room.\\n\\n“there,” said poirot, looking after her, “goes a very valuable ally.\\nthat woman, hastings, has got brains as well as a heart.”\\n\\ni did not reply.\\n\\n“instinct is a marvellous thing,” mused poirot. “it can neither be\\nexplained nor ignored.”\\n\\n“you and miss howard seem to know what you are talking about,” i\\nobserved coldly. “perhaps you don’t realize that _i_ am still in the\\ndark.”\\n\\n“really? is that so, _mon ami?_”\\n\\n“yes. enlighten me, will you?”\\n\\npoirot studied me attentively for a moment or two. then, to my intense\\nsurprise, he shook his head decidedly.\\n\\n“no, my friend.”\\n\\n“oh, look here, why not?”\\n\\n“two is enough for a secret.”\\n\\n“well, i think it is very unfair to keep back facts from me.”\\n\\n“i am not keeping back facts. every fact that i know is in your\\npossession. you can draw your own deductions from them. this time it is\\na question of ideas.”\\n\\n“still, it would be interesting to know.”\\n\\npoirot looked at me very earnestly, and again shook his head.\\n\\n“you see,” he said sadly, “_you_ have no instincts.”\\n\\n“it was intelligence you were requiring just now,” i pointed out.\\n\\n“the two often go together,” said poirot enigmatically.\\n\\nthe remark seemed so utterly irrelevant that i did not even take the\\ntrouble to answer it. but i decided that if i made any interesting and\\nimportant discoveries—as no doubt i should—i would keep them to myself,\\nand surprise poirot with the ultimate result.\\n\\nthere are times when it is one’s duty to assert oneself.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter ix.\\ndr. bauerstein\\n\\n\\ni had had no opportunity as yet of passing on poirot’s message to\\nlawrence. but now, as i strolled out on the lawn, still nursing a\\ngrudge against my friend’s high-handedness, i saw lawrence on the\\ncroquet lawn, aimlessly knocking a couple of very ancient balls about,\\nwith a still more ancient mallet.\\n\\nit struck me that it would be a good opportunity to deliver my message.\\notherwise, poirot himself might relieve me of it. it was true that i\\ndid not quite gather its purport, but i flattered myself that by\\nlawrence’s reply, and perhaps a little skillful cross-examination on my\\npart, i should soon perceive its significance. accordingly i accosted\\nhim.\\n\\n“i’ve been looking for you,” i remarked untruthfully.\\n\\n“have you?”\\n\\n“yes. the truth is, i’ve got a message for you—from poirot.”\\n\\n“yes?”\\n\\n“he told me to wait until i was alone with you,” i said, dropping my\\nvoice significantly, and watching him intently out of the corner of my\\neye. i have always been rather good at what is called, i believe,\\ncreating an atmosphere.\\n\\n“well?”\\n\\nthere was no change of expression in the dark melancholic face. had he\\nany idea of what i was about to say?\\n\\n“this is the message.” i dropped my voice still lower. “‘find the extra\\ncoffee-cup, and you can rest in peace.’”\\n\\n“what on earth does he mean?” lawrence stared at me in quite unaffected\\nastonishment.\\n\\n“don’t you know?”\\n\\n“not in the least. do you?”\\n\\ni was compelled to shake my head.\\n\\n“what extra coffee-cup?”\\n\\n“i don’t know.”\\n\\n“he’d better ask dorcas, or one of the maids, if he wants to know about\\ncoffee-cups. it’s their business, not mine. i don’t know anything about\\nthe coffee-cups, except that we’ve got some that are never used, which\\nare a perfect dream! old worcester. you’re not a connoisseur, are you,\\nhastings?”\\n\\ni shook my head.\\n\\n“you miss a lot. a really perfect bit of old china—it’s pure delight to\\nhandle it, or even to look at it.”\\n\\n“well, what am i to tell poirot?”\\n\\n“tell him i don’t know what he’s talking about. it’s double dutch to\\nme.”\\n\\n“all right.”\\n\\ni was moving off towards the house again when he suddenly called me\\nback.\\n\\n“i say, what was the end of that message? say it over again, will you?”\\n\\n“‘find the extra coffee-cup, and you can rest in peace.’ are you sure\\nyou don’t know what it means?” i asked him earnestly.\\n\\nhe shook his head.\\n\\n“no,” he said musingly, “i don’t. i—i wish i did.”\\n\\nthe boom of the gong sounded from the house, and we went in together.\\npoirot had been asked by john to remain to lunch, and was already\\nseated at the table.\\n\\nby tacit consent, all mention of the tragedy was barred. we conversed\\non the war, and other outside topics. but after the cheese and biscuits\\nhad been handed round, and dorcas had left the room, poirot suddenly\\nleant forward to mrs. cavendish.\\n\\n“pardon me, madame, for recalling unpleasant memories, but i have a\\nlittle idea”—poirot’s “little ideas” were becoming a perfect\\nbyword—“and would like to ask one or two questions.”\\n\\n“of me? certainly.”\\n\\n“you are too amiable, madame. what i want to ask is this: the door\\nleading into mrs. inglethorp’s room from that of mademoiselle cynthia,\\nit was bolted, you say?”\\n\\n“certainly it was bolted,” replied mary cavendish, rather surprised. “i\\nsaid so at the inquest.”\\n\\n“bolted?”\\n\\n“yes.” she looked perplexed.\\n\\n“i mean,” explained poirot, “you are sure it was bolted, and not merely\\nlocked?”\\n\\n“oh, i see what you mean. no, i don’t know. i said bolted, meaning that\\nit was fastened, and i could not open it, but i believe all the doors\\nwere found bolted on the inside.”\\n\\n“still, as far as you are concerned, the door might equally well have\\nbeen locked?”\\n\\n“oh, yes.”\\n\\n“you yourself did not happen to notice, madame, when you entered mrs.\\ninglethorp’s room, whether that door was bolted or not?”\\n\\n“i—i believe it was.”\\n\\n“but you did not see it?”\\n\\n“no. i—never looked.”\\n\\n“but _i_ did,” interrupted lawrence suddenly. “i happened to notice\\nthat it _was_ bolted.”\\n\\n“ah, that settles it.” and poirot looked crestfallen.\\n\\ni could not help rejoicing that, for once, one of his “little ideas”\\nhad come to naught.\\n\\nafter lunch poirot begged me to accompany him home. i consented rather\\nstiffly.\\n\\n“you are annoyed, is it not so?” he asked anxiously, as we walked\\nthrough the park.\\n\\n“not at all,” i said coldly.\\n\\n“that is well. that lifts a great load from my mind.”\\n\\nthis was not quite what i had intended. i had hoped that he would have\\nobserved the stiffness of my manner. still, the fervour of his words\\nwent towards the appeasing of my just displeasure. i thawed.\\n\\n“i gave lawrence your message,” i said.\\n\\n“and what did he say? he was entirely puzzled?”\\n\\n“yes. i am quite sure he had no idea of what you meant.”\\n\\ni had expected poirot to be disappointed; but, to my surprise, he\\nreplied that that was as he had thought, and that he was very glad. my\\npride forbade me to ask any questions.\\n\\npoirot switched off on another tack.\\n\\n“mademoiselle cynthia was not at lunch to-day? how was that?”\\n\\n“she is at the hospital again. she resumed work to-day.”\\n\\n“ah, she is an industrious little demoiselle. and pretty too. she is\\nlike pictures i have seen in italy. i would rather like to see that\\ndispensary of hers. do you think she would show it to me?”\\n\\n“i am sure she would be delighted. it’s an interesting little place.”\\n\\n“does she go there every day?”\\n\\n“she has all wednesdays off, and comes back to lunch on saturdays.\\nthose are her only times off.”\\n\\n“i will remember. women are doing great work nowadays, and mademoiselle\\ncynthia is clever—oh, yes, she has brains, that little one.”\\n\\n“yes. i believe she has passed quite a stiff exam.”\\n\\n“without doubt. after all, it is very responsible work. i suppose they\\nhave very strong poisons there?”\\n\\n“yes, she showed them to us. they are kept locked up in a little\\ncupboard. i believe they have to be very careful. they always take out\\nthe key before leaving the room.”\\n\\n“indeed. it is near the window, this cupboard?”\\n\\n“no, right the other side of the room. why?”\\n\\npoirot shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n“i wondered. that is all. will you come in?”\\n\\nwe had reached the cottage.\\n\\n“no. i think i’ll be getting back. i shall go round the long way\\nthrough the woods.”\\n\\nthe woods round styles were very beautiful. after the walk across the\\nopen park, it was pleasant to saunter lazily through the cool glades.\\nthere was hardly a breath of wind, the very chirp of the birds was\\nfaint and subdued. i strolled on a little way, and finally flung myself\\ndown at the foot of a grand old beech-tree. my thoughts of mankind were\\nkindly and charitable. i even forgave poirot for his absurd secrecy. in\\nfact, i was at peace with the world. then i yawned.\\n\\ni thought about the crime, and it struck me as being very unreal and\\nfar off.\\n\\ni yawned again.\\n\\nprobably, i thought, it really never happened. of course, it was all a\\nbad dream. the truth of the matter was that it was lawrence who had\\nmurdered alfred inglethorp with a croquet mallet. but it was absurd of\\njohn to make such a fuss about it, and to go shouting out: “i tell you\\ni won’t have it!”\\n\\ni woke up with a start.\\n\\nat once i realized that i was in a very awkward predicament. for, about\\ntwelve feet away from me, john and mary cavendish were standing facing\\neach other, and they were evidently quarrelling. and, quite as\\nevidently, they were unaware of my vicinity, for before i could move or\\nspeak john repeated the words which had aroused me from my dream.\\n\\n“i tell you, mary, i won’t have it.”\\n\\nmary’s voice came, cool and liquid:\\n\\n“have _you_ any right to criticize my actions?”\\n\\n“it will be the talk of the village! my mother was only buried on\\nsaturday, and here you are gadding about with the fellow.”\\n\\n“oh,” she shrugged her shoulders, “if it is only village gossip that\\nyou mind!”\\n\\n“but it isn’t. i’ve had enough of the fellow hanging about. he’s a\\npolish jew, anyway.”\\n\\n“a tinge of jewish blood is not a bad thing. it leavens the”—she looked\\nat him—“stolid stupidity of the ordinary englishman.”\\n\\nfire in her eyes, ice in her voice. i did not wonder that the blood\\nrose to john’s face in a crimson tide.\\n\\n“mary!”\\n\\n“well?” her tone did not change.\\n\\nthe pleading died out of his voice.\\n\\n“am i to understand that you will continue to see bauerstein against my\\nexpress wishes?”\\n\\n“if i choose.”\\n\\n“you defy me?”\\n\\n“no, but i deny your right to criticize my actions. have _you_ no\\nfriends of whom i should disapprove?”\\n\\njohn fell back a pace. the colour ebbed slowly from his face.\\n\\n“what do you mean?” he said, in an unsteady voice.\\n\\n“you see!” said mary quietly. “you _do_ see, don’t you, that _you_ have\\nno right to dictate to _me_ as to the choice of my friends?”\\n\\njohn glanced at her pleadingly, a stricken look on his face.\\n\\n“no right? have i _no_ right, mary?” he said unsteadily. he stretched\\nout his hands. “mary——”\\n\\nfor a moment, i thought she wavered. a softer expression came over her\\nface, then suddenly she turned almost fiercely away.\\n\\n“none!”\\n\\nshe was walking away when john sprang after her, and caught her by the\\narm.\\n\\n“mary”—his voice was very quiet now—“are you in love with this fellow\\nbauerstein?”\\n\\nshe hesitated, and suddenly there swept across her face a strange\\nexpression, old as the hills, yet with something eternally young about\\nit. so might some egyptian sphinx have smiled.\\n\\nshe freed herself quietly from his arm, and spoke over her shoulder.\\n\\n“perhaps,” she said; and then swiftly passed out of the little glade,\\nleaving john standing there as though he had been turned to stone.\\n\\nrather ostentatiously, i stepped forward, crackling some dead branches\\nwith my feet as i did so. john turned. luckily, he took it for granted\\nthat i had only just come upon the scene.\\n\\n“hullo, hastings. have you seen the little fellow safely back to his\\ncottage? quaint little chap! is he any good, though, really?”\\n\\n“he was considered one of the finest detectives of his day.”\\n\\n“oh, well, i suppose there must be something in it, then. what a rotten\\nworld it is, though!”\\n\\n“you find it so?” i asked.\\n\\n“good lord, yes! there’s this terrible business to start with. scotland\\nyard men in and out of the house like a jack-in-the-box! never know\\nwhere they won’t turn up next. screaming headlines in every paper in\\nthe country—damn all journalists, i say! do you know there was a whole\\ncrowd staring in at the lodge gates this morning. sort of madame\\ntussaud’s chamber of horrors business that can be seen for nothing.\\npretty thick, isn’t it?”\\n\\n“cheer up, john!” i said soothingly. “it can’t last for ever.”\\n\\n“can’t it, though? it can last long enough for us never to be able to\\nhold up our heads again.”\\n\\n“no, no, you’re getting morbid on the subject.”\\n\\n“enough to make a man morbid, to be stalked by beastly journalists and\\nstared at by gaping moon-faced idiots, wherever he goes! but there’s\\nworse than that.”\\n\\n“what?”\\n\\njohn lowered his voice:\\n\\n“have you ever thought, hastings—it’s a nightmare to me—who did it? i\\ncan’t help feeling sometimes it must have been an accident.\\nbecause—because—who could have done it? now inglethorp’s out of the\\nway, there’s no one else; no one, i mean, except—one of us.”\\n\\nyes, indeed, that was nightmare enough for any man! one of us? yes,\\nsurely it must be so, unless——-\\n\\na new idea suggested itself to my mind. rapidly, i considered it. the\\nlight increased. poirot’s mysterious doings, his hints—they all fitted\\nin. fool that i was not to have thought of this possibility before, and\\nwhat a relief for us all.\\n\\n“no, john,” i said, “it isn’t one of us. how could it be?”\\n\\n“i know, but, still, who else is there?”\\n\\n“can’t you guess?”\\n\\n“no.”\\n\\ni looked cautiously round, and lowered my voice.\\n\\n“dr. bauerstein!” i whispered.\\n\\n“impossible!”\\n\\n“not at all.”\\n\\n“but what earthly interest could he have in my mother’s death?”\\n\\n“that i don’t see,” i confessed, “but i’ll tell you this: poirot thinks\\nso.”\\n\\n“poirot? does he? how do you know?”\\n\\ni told him of poirot’s intense excitement on hearing that dr.\\nbauerstein had been at styles on the fatal night, and added:\\n\\n“he said twice: ‘that alters everything.’ and i’ve been thinking. you\\nknow inglethorp said he had put down the coffee in the hall? well, it\\nwas just then that bauerstein arrived. isn’t it possible that, as\\ninglethorp brought him through the hall, the doctor dropped something\\ninto the coffee in passing?”\\n\\n“h’m,” said john. “it would have been very risky.”\\n\\n“yes, but it was possible.”\\n\\n“and then, how could he know it was her coffee? no, old fellow, i don’t\\nthink that will wash.”\\n\\nbut i had remembered something else.\\n\\n“you’re quite right. that wasn’t how it was done. listen.” and i then\\ntold him of the cocoa sample which poirot had taken to be analysed.\\n\\njohn interrupted just as i had done.\\n\\n“but, look here, bauerstein had had it analysed already?”\\n\\n“yes, yes, that’s the point. i didn’t see it either until now. don’t\\nyou understand? bauerstein had it analysed—that’s just it! if\\nbauerstein’s the murderer, nothing could be simpler than for him to\\nsubstitute some ordinary cocoa for his sample, and send that to be\\ntested. and of course they would find no strychnine! but no one would\\ndream of suspecting bauerstein, or think of taking another\\nsample—except poirot,” i added, with belated recognition.\\n\\n“yes, but what about the bitter taste that cocoa won’t disguise?”\\n\\n“well, we’ve only his word for that. and there are other possibilities.\\nhe’s admittedly one of the world’s greatest toxicologists——”\\n\\n“one of the world’s greatest what? say it again.”\\n\\n“he knows more about poisons than almost anybody,” i explained. “well,\\nmy idea is, that perhaps he’s found some way of making strychnine\\ntasteless. or it may not have been strychnine at all, but some obscure\\ndrug no one has ever heard of, which produces much the same symptoms.”\\n\\n“h’m, yes, that might be,” said john. “but look here, how could he have\\ngot at the cocoa? that wasn’t downstairs?”\\n\\n“no, it wasn’t,” i admitted reluctantly.\\n\\nand then, suddenly, a dreadful possibility flashed through my mind. i\\nhoped and prayed it would not occur to john also. i glanced sideways at\\nhim. he was frowning perplexedly, and i drew a deep breath of relief,\\nfor the terrible thought that had flashed across my mind was this: that\\ndr. bauerstein might have had an accomplice.\\n\\nyet surely it could not be! surely no woman as beautiful as mary\\ncavendish could be a murderess. yet beautiful women had been known to\\npoison.\\n\\nand suddenly i remembered that first conversation at tea on the day of\\nmy arrival, and the gleam in her eyes as she had said that poison was a\\nwoman’s weapon. how agitated she had been on that fatal tuesday\\nevening! had mrs. inglethorp discovered something between her and\\nbauerstein, and threatened to tell her husband? was it to stop that\\ndenunciation that the crime had been committed?\\n\\nthen i remembered that enigmatical conversation between poirot and\\nevelyn howard. was this what they had meant? was this the monstrous\\npossibility that evelyn had tried not to believe?\\n\\nyes, it all fitted in.\\n\\nno wonder miss howard had suggested “hushing it up.” now i understood\\nthat unfinished sentence of hers: “emily herself——” and in my heart i\\nagreed with her. would not mrs. inglethorp have preferred to go\\nunavenged rather than have such terrible dishonour fall upon the name\\nof cavendish.\\n\\n“there’s another thing,” said john suddenly, and the unexpected sound\\nof his voice made me start guiltily. “something which makes me doubt if\\nwhat you say can be true.”\\n\\n“what’s that?” i asked, thankful that he had gone away from the subject\\nof how the poison could have been introduced into the cocoa.\\n\\n“why, the fact that bauerstein demanded a post-mortem. he needn’t have\\ndone so. little wilkins would have been quite content to let it go at\\nheart disease.”\\n\\n“yes,” i said doubtfully. “but we don’t know. perhaps he thought it\\nsafer in the long run. someone might have talked afterwards. then the\\nhome office might have ordered exhumation. the whole thing would have\\ncome out, then, and he would have been in an awkward position, for no\\none would have believed that a man of his reputation could have been\\ndeceived into calling it heart disease.”\\n\\n“yes, that’s possible,” admitted john. “still,” he added, “i’m blest if\\ni can see what his motive could have been.”\\n\\ni trembled.\\n\\n“look here,” i said, “i may be altogether wrong. and, remember, all\\nthis is in confidence.”\\n\\n“oh, of course—that goes without saying.”\\n\\nwe had walked, as we talked, and now we passed through the little gate\\ninto the garden. voices rose near at hand, for tea was spread out under\\nthe sycamore-tree, as it had been on the day of my arrival.\\n\\ncynthia was back from the hospital, and i placed my chair beside her,\\nand told her of poirot’s wish to visit the dispensary.\\n\\n“of course! i’d love him to see it. he’d better come to tea there one\\nday. i must fix it up with him. he’s such a dear little man! but he\\n_is_ funny. he made me take the brooch out of my tie the other day, and\\nput it in again, because he said it wasn’t straight.”\\n\\ni laughed.\\n\\n“it’s quite a mania with him.”\\n\\n“yes, isn’t it?”\\n\\nwe were silent for a minute or two, and then, glancing in the direction\\nof mary cavendish, and dropping her voice, cynthia said:\\n\\n“mr. hastings.”\\n\\n“yes?”\\n\\n“after tea, i want to talk to you.”\\n\\nher glance at mary had set me thinking. i fancied that between these\\ntwo there existed very little sympathy. for the first time, it occurred\\nto me to wonder about the girl’s future. mrs. inglethorp had made no\\nprovisions of any kind for her, but i imagined that john and mary would\\nprobably insist on her making her home with them—at any rate until the\\nend of the war. john, i knew, was very fond of her, and would be sorry\\nto let her go.\\n\\njohn, who had gone into the house, now reappeared. his good-natured\\nface wore an unaccustomed frown of anger.\\n\\n“confound those detectives! i can’t think what they’re after! they’ve\\nbeen in every room in the house—turning things inside out, and upside\\ndown. it really is too bad! i suppose they took advantage of our all\\nbeing out. i shall go for that fellow japp, when i next see him!”\\n\\n“lot of paul prys,” grunted miss howard.\\n\\nlawrence opined that they had to make a show of doing something.\\n\\nmary cavendish said nothing.\\n\\nafter tea, i invited cynthia to come for a walk, and we sauntered off\\ninto the woods together.\\n\\n“well?” i inquired, as soon as we were protected from prying eyes by\\nthe leafy screen.\\n\\nwith a sigh, cynthia flung herself down, and tossed off her hat. the\\nsunlight, piercing through the branches, turned the auburn of her hair\\nto quivering gold.\\n\\n“mr. hastings—you are always so kind, and you know such a lot.”\\n\\nit struck me at this moment that cynthia was really a very charming\\ngirl! much more charming than mary, who never said things of that kind.\\n\\n“well?” i asked benignantly, as she hesitated.\\n\\n“i want to ask your advice. what shall i do?”\\n\\n“do?”\\n\\n“yes. you see, aunt emily always told me i should be provided for. i\\nsuppose she forgot, or didn’t think she was likely to die—anyway, i am\\n_not_ provided for! and i don’t know what to do. do you think i ought\\nto go away from here at once?”\\n\\n“good heavens, no! they don’t want to part with you, i’m sure.”\\n\\ncynthia hesitated a moment, plucking up the grass with her tiny hands.\\nthen she said: “mrs. cavendish does. she hates me.”\\n\\n“hates you?” i cried, astonished.\\n\\ncynthia nodded.\\n\\n“yes. i don’t know why, but she can’t bear me; and _he_ can’t, either.”\\n\\n“there i know you’re wrong,” i said warmly. “on the contrary, john is\\nvery fond of you.”\\n\\n“oh, yes—_john_. i meant lawrence. not, of course, that i care whether\\nlawrence hates me or not. still, it’s rather horrid when no one loves\\nyou, isn’t it?”\\n\\n“but they do, cynthia dear,” i said earnestly. “i’m sure you are\\nmistaken. look, there is john—and miss howard——”\\n\\ncynthia nodded rather gloomily. “yes, john likes me, i think, and of\\ncourse evie, for all her gruff ways, wouldn’t be unkind to a fly. but\\nlawrence never speaks to me if he can help it, and mary can hardly\\nbring herself to be civil to me. she wants evie to stay on, is begging\\nher to, but she doesn’t want me, and—and—i don’t know what to do.”\\nsuddenly the poor child burst out crying.\\n\\ni don’t know what possessed me. her beauty, perhaps, as she sat there,\\nwith the sunlight glinting down on her head; perhaps the sense of\\nrelief at encountering someone who so obviously could have no\\nconnection with the tragedy; perhaps honest pity for her youth and\\nloneliness. anyway, i leant forward, and taking her little hand, i said\\nawkwardly:\\n\\n“marry me, cynthia.”\\n\\nunwittingly, i had hit upon a sovereign remedy for her tears. she sat\\nup at once, drew her hand away, and said, with some asperity:\\n\\n“don’t be silly!”\\n\\ni was a little annoyed.\\n\\n“i’m not being silly. i am asking you to do me the honour of becoming\\nmy wife.”\\n\\nto my intense surprise, cynthia burst out laughing, and called me a\\n“funny dear.”\\n\\n“it’s perfectly sweet of you,” she said, “but you know you don’t want\\nto!”\\n\\n“yes, i do. i’ve got——”\\n\\n“never mind what you’ve got. you don’t really want to—and i don’t\\neither.”\\n\\n“well, of course, that settles it,” i said stiffly. “but i don’t see\\nanything to laugh at. there’s nothing funny about a proposal.”\\n\\n“no, indeed,” said cynthia. “somebody might accept you next time.\\ngood-bye, you’ve cheered me up _very_ much.”\\n\\nand, with a final uncontrollable burst of merriment, she vanished\\nthrough the trees.\\n\\nthinking over the interview, it struck me as being profoundly\\nunsatisfactory.\\n\\nit occurred to me suddenly that i would go down to the village, and\\nlook up bauerstein. somebody ought to be keeping an eye on the fellow.\\nat the same time, it would be wise to allay any suspicions he might\\nhave as to his being suspected. i remembered how poirot had relied on\\nmy diplomacy. accordingly, i went to the little house with the\\n“apartments” card inserted in the window, where i knew he lodged, and\\ntapped on the door.\\n\\nan old woman came and opened it.\\n\\n“good afternoon,” i said pleasantly. “is dr. bauerstein in?”\\n\\nshe stared at me.\\n\\n“haven’t you heard?”\\n\\n“heard what?”\\n\\n“about him.”\\n\\n“what about him?”\\n\\n“he’s took.”\\n\\n“took? dead?”\\n\\n“no, took by the perlice.”\\n\\n“by the police!” i gasped. “do you mean they’ve arrested him?”\\n\\n“yes, that’s it, and——”\\n\\ni waited to hear no more, but tore up the village to find poirot.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter x.\\nthe arrest\\n\\n\\nto my extreme annoyance, poirot was not in, and the old belgian who\\nanswered my knock informed me that he believed he had gone to london.\\n\\ni was dumbfounded. what on earth could poirot be doing in london! was\\nit a sudden decision on his part, or had he already made up his mind\\nwhen he parted from me a few hours earlier?\\n\\ni retraced my steps to styles in some annoyance. with poirot away, i\\nwas uncertain how to act. had he foreseen this arrest? had he not, in\\nall probability, been the cause of it? those questions i could not\\nresolve. but in the meantime what was i to do? should i announce the\\narrest openly at styles, or not? though i did not acknowledge it to\\nmyself, the thought of mary cavendish was weighing on me. would it not\\nbe a terrible shock to her? for the moment, i set aside utterly any\\nsuspicions of her. she could not be implicated—otherwise i should have\\nheard some hint of it.\\n\\nof course, there was no possibility of being able permanently to\\nconceal dr. bauerstein’s arrest from her. it would be announced in\\nevery newspaper on the morrow. still, i shrank from blurting it out. if\\nonly poirot had been accessible, i could have asked his advice. what\\npossessed him to go posting off to london in this unaccountable way?\\n\\nin spite of myself, my opinion of his sagacity was immeasurably\\nheightened. i would never have dreamt of suspecting the doctor, had not\\npoirot put it into my head. yes, decidedly, the little man was clever.\\n\\nafter some reflecting, i decided to take john into my confidence, and\\nleave him to make the matter public or not, as he thought fit.\\n\\nhe gave vent to a prodigious whistle, as i imparted the news.\\n\\n“great scott! you _were_ right, then. i couldn’t believe it at the\\ntime.”\\n\\n“no, it is astonishing until you get used to the idea, and see how it\\nmakes everything fit in. now, what are we to do? of course, it will be\\ngenerally known to-morrow.”\\n\\njohn reflected.\\n\\n“never mind,” he said at last, “we won’t say anything at present. there\\nis no need. as you say, it will be known soon enough.”\\n\\nbut to my intense surprise, on getting down early the next morning, and\\neagerly opening the newspapers, there was not a word about the arrest!\\nthere was a column of mere padding about “the styles poisoning case,”\\nbut nothing further. it was rather inexplicable, but i supposed that,\\nfor some reason or other, japp wished to keep it out of the papers. it\\nworried me just a little, for it suggested the possibility that there\\nmight be further arrests to come.\\n\\nafter breakfast, i decided to go down to the village, and see if poirot\\nhad returned yet; but, before i could start, a well-known face blocked\\none of the windows, and the well-known voice said:\\n\\n“_bonjour, mon ami!_”\\n\\n“poirot,” i exclaimed, with relief, and seizing him by both hands, i\\ndragged him into the room. “i was never so glad to see anyone. listen,\\ni have said nothing to anybody but john. is that right?”\\n\\n“my friend,” replied poirot, “i do not know what you are talking\\nabout.”\\n\\n“dr. bauerstein’s arrest, of course,” i answered impatiently.\\n\\n“is bauerstein arrested, then?”\\n\\n“did you not know it?”\\n\\n“not the least in the world.” but, pausing a moment, he added: “still,\\nit does not surprise me. after all, we are only four miles from the\\ncoast.”\\n\\n“the coast?” i asked, puzzled. “what has that got to do with it?”\\n\\npoirot shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n“surely, it is obvious!”\\n\\n“not to me. no doubt i am very dense, but i cannot see what the\\nproximity of the coast has got to do with the murder of mrs.\\ninglethorp.”\\n\\n“nothing at all, of course,” replied poirot, smiling. “but we were\\nspeaking of the arrest of dr. bauerstein.”\\n\\n“well, he is arrested for the murder of mrs. inglethorp——”\\n\\n“what?” cried poirot, in apparently lively astonishment. “dr.\\nbauerstein arrested for the murder of mrs. inglethorp?”\\n\\n“yes.”\\n\\n“impossible! that would be too good a farce! who told you that, my\\nfriend?”\\n\\n“well, no one exactly told me,” i confessed. “but he is arrested.”\\n\\n“oh, yes, very likely. but for espionage, _mon ami_.”\\n\\n“espionage?” i gasped.\\n\\n“precisely.”\\n\\n“not for poisoning mrs. inglethorp?”\\n\\n“not unless our friend japp has taken leave of his senses,” replied\\npoirot placidly.\\n\\n“but—but i thought you thought so too?”\\n\\npoirot gave me one look, which conveyed a wondering pity, and his full\\nsense of the utter absurdity of such an idea.\\n\\n“do you mean to say,” i asked, slowly adapting myself to the new idea,\\n“that dr. bauerstein is a spy?”\\n\\npoirot nodded.\\n\\n“have you never suspected it?”\\n\\n“it never entered my head.”\\n\\n“it did not strike you as peculiar that a famous london doctor should\\nbury himself in a little village like this, and should be in the habit\\nof walking about at all hours of the night, fully dressed?”\\n\\n“no,” i confessed, “i never thought of such a thing.”\\n\\n“he is, of course, a german by birth,” said poirot thoughtfully,\\n“though he has practised so long in this country that nobody thinks of\\nhim as anything but an englishman. he was naturalized about fifteen\\nyears ago. a very clever man—a jew, of course.”\\n\\n“the blackguard!” i cried indignantly.\\n\\n“not at all. he is, on the contrary, a patriot. think what he stands to\\nlose. i admire the man myself.”\\n\\nbut i could not look at it in poirot’s philosophical way.\\n\\n“and this is the man with whom mrs. cavendish has been wandering about\\nall over the country!” i cried indignantly.\\n\\n“yes. i should fancy he had found her very useful,” remarked poirot.\\n“so long as gossip busied itself in coupling their names together, any\\nother vagaries of the doctor’s passed unobserved.”\\n\\n“then you think he never really cared for her?” i asked eagerly—rather\\ntoo eagerly, perhaps, under the circumstances.\\n\\n“that, of course, i cannot say, but—shall i tell you my own private\\nopinion, hastings?”\\n\\n“yes.”\\n\\n“well, it is this: that mrs. cavendish does not care, and never has\\ncared one little jot about dr. bauerstein!”\\n\\n“do you really think so?” i could not disguise my pleasure.\\n\\n“i am quite sure of it. and i will tell you why.”\\n\\n“yes?”\\n\\n“because she cares for someone else, _mon ami_.”\\n\\n“oh!” what did he mean? in spite of myself, an agreeable warmth spread\\nover me. i am not a vain man where women are concerned, but i\\nremembered certain evidences, too lightly thought of at the time,\\nperhaps, but which certainly seemed to indicate——\\n\\nmy pleasing thoughts were interrupted by the sudden entrance of miss\\nhoward. she glanced round hastily to make sure there was no one else in\\nthe room, and quickly produced an old sheet of brown paper. this she\\nhanded to poirot, murmuring as she did so the cryptic words:\\n\\n“on top of the wardrobe.” then she hurriedly left the room.\\n\\npoirot unfolded the sheet of paper eagerly, and uttered an exclamation\\nof satisfaction. he spread it out on the table.\\n\\n“come here, hastings. now tell me, what is that initial—j. or l.?”\\n\\nit was a medium sized sheet of paper, rather dusty, as though it had\\nlain by for some time. but it was the label that was attracting\\npoirot’s attention. at the top, it bore the printed stamp of messrs.\\nparkson’s, the well-known theatrical costumiers, and it was addressed\\nto “—(the debatable initial) cavendish, esq., styles court, styles st.\\nmary, essex.”\\n\\n“it might be t., or it might be l.,” i said, after studying the thing\\nfor a minute or two. “it certainly isn’t a j.”\\n\\n“good,” replied poirot, folding up the paper again. “i, also, am of\\nyour way of thinking. it is an l., depend upon it!”\\n\\n“where did it come from?” i asked curiously. “is it important?”\\n\\n“moderately so. it confirms a surmise of mine. having deduced its\\nexistence, i set miss howard to search for it, and, as you see, she has\\nbeen successful.”\\n\\n“what did she mean by ‘on the top of the wardrobe’?”\\n\\n“she meant,” replied poirot promptly, “that she found it on top of a\\nwardrobe.”\\n\\n“a funny place for a piece of brown paper,” i mused.\\n\\n“not at all. the top of a wardrobe is an excellent place for brown\\npaper and cardboard boxes. i have kept them there myself. neatly\\narranged, there is nothing to offend the eye.”\\n\\n“poirot,” i asked earnestly, “have you made up your mind about this\\ncrime?”\\n\\n“yes—that is to say, i believe i know how it was committed.”\\n\\n“ah!”\\n\\n“unfortunately, i have no proof beyond my surmise, unless——” with\\nsudden energy, he caught me by the arm, and whirled me down the hall,\\ncalling out in french in his excitement: “mademoiselle dorcas,\\nmademoiselle dorcas, _un moment, s’il vous plaît!_”\\n\\ndorcas, quite flurried by the noise, came hurrying out of the pantry.\\n\\n“my good dorcas, i have an idea—a little idea—if it should prove\\njustified, what magnificent chance! tell me, on monday, not tuesday,\\ndorcas, but monday, the day before the tragedy, did anything go wrong\\nwith mrs. inglethorp’s bell?”\\n\\ndorcas looked very surprised.\\n\\n“yes, sir, now you mention it, it did; though i don’t know how you came\\nto hear of it. a mouse, or some such, must have nibbled the wire\\nthrough. the man came and put it right on tuesday morning.”\\n\\nwith a long drawn exclamation of ecstasy, poirot led the way back to\\nthe morning-room.\\n\\n“see you, one should not ask for outside proof—no, reason should be\\nenough. but the flesh is weak, it is consolation to find that one is on\\nthe right track. ah, my friend, i am like a giant refreshed. i run! i\\nleap!”\\n\\nand, in very truth, run and leap he did, gambolling wildly down the\\nstretch of lawn outside the long window.\\n\\n“what is your remarkable little friend doing?” asked a voice behind me,\\nand i turned to find mary cavendish at my elbow. she smiled, and so did\\ni. “what is it all about?”\\n\\n“really, i can’t tell you. he asked dorcas some question about a bell,\\nand appeared so delighted with her answer that he is capering about as\\nyou see!”\\n\\nmary laughed.\\n\\n“how ridiculous! he’s going out of the gate. isn’t he coming back\\nto-day?”\\n\\n“i don’t know. i’ve given up trying to guess what he’ll do next.”\\n\\n“is he quite mad, mr. hastings?”\\n\\n“i honestly don’t know. sometimes, i feel sure he is as mad as a\\nhatter; and then, just as he is at his maddest, i find there is method\\nin his madness.”\\n\\n“i see.”\\n\\nin spite of her laugh, mary was looking thoughtful this morning. she\\nseemed grave, almost sad.\\n\\nit occurred to me that it would be a good opportunity to tackle her on\\nthe subject of cynthia. i began rather tactfully, _i_ thought, but i\\nhad not gone far before she stopped me authoritatively.\\n\\n“you are an excellent advocate, i have no doubt, mr. hastings, but in\\nthis case your talents are quite thrown away. cynthia will run no risk\\nof encountering any unkindness from me.”\\n\\ni began to stammer feebly that i hoped she hadn’t thought—— but again\\nshe stopped me, and her words were so unexpected that they quite drove\\ncynthia, and her troubles, out of my mind.\\n\\n“mr. hastings,” she said, “do you think i and my husband are happy\\ntogether?”\\n\\ni was considerably taken aback, and murmured something about it’s not\\nbeing my business to think anything of the sort.\\n\\n“well,” she said quietly, “whether it is your business or not, i will\\ntell you that we are _not_ happy.”\\n\\ni said nothing, for i saw that she had not finished.\\n\\nshe began slowly, walking up and down the room, her head a little bent,\\nand that slim, supple figure of hers swaying gently as she walked. she\\nstopped suddenly, and looked up at me.\\n\\n“you don’t know anything about me, do you?” she asked. “where i come\\nfrom, who i was before i married john—anything, in fact? well, i will\\ntell you. i will make a father confessor of you. you are kind, i\\nthink—yes, i am sure you are kind.”\\n\\nsomehow, i was not quite as elated as i might have been. i remembered\\nthat cynthia had begun her confidences in much the same way. besides, a\\nfather confessor should be elderly, it is not at all the role for a\\nyoung man.\\n\\n“my father was english,” said mrs. cavendish, “but my mother was a\\nrussian.”\\n\\n“ah,” i said, “now i understand——”\\n\\n“understand what?”\\n\\n“a hint of something foreign—different—that there has always been about\\nyou.”\\n\\n“my mother was very beautiful, i believe. i don’t know, because i never\\nsaw her. she died when i was quite a little child. i believe there was\\nsome tragedy connected with her death—she took an overdose of some\\nsleeping draught by mistake. however that may be, my father was\\nbroken-hearted. shortly afterwards, he went into the consular service.\\neverywhere he went, i went with him. when i was twenty-three, i had\\nbeen nearly all over the world. it was a splendid life—i loved it.”\\n\\nthere was a smile on her face, and her head was thrown back. she seemed\\nliving in the memory of those old glad days.\\n\\n“then my father died. he left me very badly off. i had to go and live\\nwith some old aunts in yorkshire.” she shuddered. “you will understand\\nme when i say that it was a deadly life for a girl brought up as i had\\nbeen. the narrowness, the deadly monotony of it, almost drove me mad.”\\nshe paused a minute, and added in a different tone: “and then i met\\njohn cavendish.”\\n\\n“yes?”\\n\\n“you can imagine that, from my aunts’ point of view, it was a very good\\nmatch for me. but i can honestly say it was not this fact which weighed\\nwith me. no, he was simply a way of escape from the insufferable\\nmonotony of my life.”\\n\\ni said nothing, and after a moment, she went on:\\n\\n“don’t misunderstand me. i was quite honest with him. i told him, what\\nwas true, that i liked him very much, that i hoped to come to like him\\nmore, but that i was not in any way what the world calls ‘in love’ with\\nhim. he declared that that satisfied him, and so—we were married.”\\n\\nshe waited a long time, a little frown had gathered on her forehead.\\nshe seemed to be looking back earnestly into those past days.\\n\\n“i think—i am sure—he cared for me at first. but i suppose we were not\\nwell matched. almost at once, we drifted apart. he—it is not a pleasing\\nthing for my pride, but it is the truth—tired of me very soon.” i must\\nhave made some murmur of dissent, for she went on quickly: “oh, yes, he\\ndid! not that it matters now—now that we’ve come to the parting of the\\nways.”\\n\\n“what do you mean?”\\n\\nshe answered quietly:\\n\\n“i mean that i am not going to remain at styles.”\\n\\n“you and john are not going to live here?”\\n\\n“john may live here, but i shall not.”\\n\\n“you are going to leave him?”\\n\\n“yes.”\\n\\n“but why?”\\n\\nshe paused a long time, and said at last:\\n\\n“perhaps—because i want to be—free!”\\n\\nand, as she spoke, i had a sudden vision of broad spaces, virgin tracts\\nof forests, untrodden lands—and a realization of what freedom would\\nmean to such a nature as mary cavendish. i seemed to see her for a\\nmoment as she was, a proud wild creature, as untamed by civilization as\\nsome shy bird of the hills. a little cry broke from her lips:\\n\\n“you don’t know, you don’t know, how this hateful place has been prison\\nto me!”\\n\\n“i understand,” i said, “but—but don’t do anything rash.”\\n\\n“oh, rash!” her voice mocked at my prudence.\\n\\nthen suddenly i said a thing i could have bitten out my tongue for:\\n\\n“you know that dr. bauerstein has been arrested?”\\n\\nan instant coldness passed like a mask over her face, blotting out all\\nexpression.\\n\\n“john was so kind as to break that to me this morning.”\\n\\n“well, what do you think?” i asked feebly.\\n\\n“of what?”\\n\\n“of the arrest?”\\n\\n“what should i think? apparently he is a german spy; so the gardener\\nhad told john.”\\n\\nher face and voice were absolutely cold and expressionless. did she\\ncare, or did she not?\\n\\nshe moved away a step or two, and fingered one of the flower vases.\\n\\n“these are quite dead. i must do them again. would you mind\\nmoving—thank you, mr. hastings.” and she walked quietly past me out of\\nthe window, with a cool little nod of dismissal.\\n\\nno, surely she could not care for bauerstein. no woman could act her\\npart with that icy unconcern.\\n\\npoirot did not make his appearance the following morning, and there was\\nno sign of the scotland yard men.\\n\\nbut, at lunch-time, there arrived a new piece of evidence—or rather\\nlack of evidence. we had vainly tried to trace the fourth letter, which\\nmrs. inglethorp had written on the evening preceding her death. our\\nefforts having been in vain, we had abandoned the matter, hoping that\\nit might turn up of itself one day. and this is just what did happen,\\nin the shape of a communication, which arrived by the second post from\\na firm of french music publishers, acknowledging mrs. inglethorp’s\\ncheque, and regretting they had been unable to trace a certain series\\nof russian folksongs. so the last hope of solving the mystery, by means\\nof mrs. inglethorp’s correspondence on the fatal evening, had to be\\nabandoned.\\n\\njust before tea, i strolled down to tell poirot of the new\\ndisappointment, but found, to my annoyance, that he was once more out.\\n\\n“gone to london again?”\\n\\n“oh, no, monsieur, he has but taken the train to tadminster. ‘to see a\\nyoung lady’s dispensary,’ he said.”\\n\\n“silly ass!” i ejaculated. “i told him wednesday was the one day she\\nwasn’t there! well, tell him to look us up to-morrow morning, will\\nyou?”\\n\\n“certainly, monsieur.”\\n\\nbut, on the following day, no sign of poirot. i was getting angry. he\\nwas really treating us in the most cavalier fashion.\\n\\nafter lunch, lawrence drew me aside, and asked if i was going down to\\nsee him.\\n\\n“no, i don’t think i shall. he can come up here if he wants to see us.”\\n\\n“oh!” lawrence looked indeterminate. something unusually nervous and\\nexcited in his manner roused my curiosity.\\n\\n“what is it?” i asked. “i could go if there’s anything special.”\\n\\n“it’s nothing much, but—well, if you are going, will you tell him——” he\\ndropped his voice to a whisper—“i think i’ve found the extra\\ncoffee-cup!”\\n\\ni had almost forgotten that enigmatical message of poirot’s, but now my\\ncuriosity was aroused afresh.\\n\\nlawrence would say no more, so i decided that i would descend from my\\nhigh horse, and once more seek out poirot at leastways cottage.\\n\\nthis time i was received with a smile. monsieur poirot was within.\\nwould i mount? i mounted accordingly.\\n\\npoirot was sitting by the table, his head buried in his hands. he\\nsprang up at my entrance.\\n\\n“what is it?” i asked solicitously. “you are not ill, i trust?”\\n\\n“no, no, not ill. but i decide an affair of great moment.”\\n\\n“whether to catch the criminal or not?” i asked facetiously.\\n\\nbut, to my great surprise, poirot nodded gravely.\\n\\n“‘to speak or not to speak,’ as your so great shakespeare says, ‘that\\nis the question.’”\\n\\ni did not trouble to correct the quotation.\\n\\n“you are not serious, poirot?”\\n\\n“i am of the most serious. for the most serious of all things hangs in\\nthe balance.”\\n\\n“and that is?”\\n\\n“a woman’s happiness, _mon ami_,” he said gravely.\\n\\ni did not quite know what to say.\\n\\n“the moment has come,” said poirot thoughtfully, “and i do not know\\nwhat to do. for, see you, it is a big stake for which i play. no one\\nbut i, hercule poirot, would attempt it!” and he tapped himself proudly\\non the breast.\\n\\nafter pausing a few minutes respectfully, so as not to spoil his\\neffect, i gave him lawrence’s message.\\n\\n“aha!” he cried. “so he has found the extra coffee-cup. that is good.\\nhe has more intelligence than would appear, this long-faced monsieur\\nlawrence of yours!”\\n\\ni did not myself think very highly of lawrence’s intelligence; but i\\nforebore to contradict poirot, and gently took him to task for\\nforgetting my instructions as to which were cynthia’s days off.\\n\\n“it is true. i have the head of a sieve. however, the other young lady\\nwas most kind. she was sorry for my disappointment, and showed me\\neverything in the kindest way.”\\n\\n“oh, well, that’s all right, then, and you must go to tea with cynthia\\nanother day.”\\n\\ni told him about the letter.\\n\\n“i am sorry for that,” he said. “i always had hopes of that letter. but\\nno, it was not to be. this affair must all be unravelled from within.”\\nhe tapped his forehead. “these little grey cells. it is ‘up to them’—as\\nyou say over here.” then, suddenly, he asked: “are you a judge of\\nfinger-marks, my friend?”\\n\\n“no,” i said, rather surprised, “i know that there are no two\\nfinger-marks alike, but that’s as far as my science goes.”\\n\\n“exactly.”\\n\\nhe unlocked a little drawer, and took out some photographs which he\\nlaid on the table.\\n\\n“i have numbered them, 1, 2, 3. will you describe them to me?”\\n\\ni studied the proofs attentively.\\n\\n“all greatly magnified, i see. no. 1, i should say, are a man’s\\nfinger-prints; thumb and first finger. no. 2 are a lady’s; they are\\nmuch smaller, and quite different in every way. no. 3”—i paused for\\nsome time—“there seem to be a lot of confused finger-marks, but here,\\nvery distinctly, are no. 1’s.”\\n\\n“overlapping the others?”\\n\\n“yes.”\\n\\n“you recognize them beyond fail?”\\n\\n“oh, yes; they are identical.”\\n\\npoirot nodded, and gently taking the photographs from me locked them up\\nagain.\\n\\n“i suppose,” i said, “that as usual, you are not going to explain?”\\n\\n“on the contrary. no. 1 were the finger-prints of monsieur lawrence.\\nno. 2 were those of mademoiselle cynthia. they are not important. i\\nmerely obtained them for comparison. no. 3 is a little more\\ncomplicated.”\\n\\n“yes?”\\n\\n“it is, as you see, highly magnified. you may have noticed a sort of\\nblur extending all across the picture. i will not describe to you the\\nspecial apparatus, dusting powder, etc., which i used. it is a\\nwell-known process to the police, and by means of it you can obtain a\\nphotograph of the finger-prints of any object in a very short space of\\ntime. well, my friend, you have seen the finger-marks—it remains to\\ntell you the particular object on which they had been left.”\\n\\n“go on—i am really excited.”\\n\\n“_eh bien!_ photo no. 3 represents the highly magnified surface of a\\ntiny bottle in the top poison cupboard of the dispensary in the red\\ncross hospital at tadminster—which sounds like the house that jack\\nbuilt!”\\n\\n“good heavens!” i exclaimed. “but what were lawrence cavendish’s\\nfinger-marks doing on it? he never went near the poison cupboard the\\nday we were there!”\\n\\n“oh, yes, he did!”\\n\\n“impossible! we were all together the whole time.”\\n\\npoirot shook his head.\\n\\n“no, my friend, there was a moment when you were not all together.\\nthere was a moment when you could not have been all together, or it\\nwould not have been necessary to call to monsieur lawrence to come and\\njoin you on the balcony.”\\n\\n“i’d forgotten that,” i admitted. “but it was only for a moment.”\\n\\n“long enough.”\\n\\n“long enough for what?”\\n\\npoirot’s smile became rather enigmatical.\\n\\n“long enough for a gentleman who had once studied medicine to gratify a\\nvery natural interest and curiosity.”\\n\\nour eyes met. poirot’s were pleasantly vague. he got up and hummed a\\nlittle tune. i watched him suspiciously.\\n\\n“poirot,” i said, “what was in this particular little bottle?”\\n\\npoirot looked out of the window.\\n\\n“hydro-chloride of strychnine,” he said, over his shoulder, continuing\\nto hum.\\n\\n“good heavens!” i said it quite quietly. i was not surprised. i had\\nexpected that answer.\\n\\n“they use the pure hydro-chloride of strychnine very little—only\\noccasionally for pills. it is the official solution, liq. strychnine\\nhydro-clor. that is used in most medicines. that is why the\\nfinger-marks have remained undisturbed since then.”\\n\\n“how did you manage to take this photograph?”\\n\\n“i dropped my hat from the balcony,” explained poirot simply. “visitors\\nwere not permitted below at that hour, so, in spite of my many\\napologies, mademoiselle cynthia’s colleague had to go down and fetch it\\nfor me.”\\n\\n“then you knew what you were going to find?”\\n\\n“no, not at all. i merely realized that it was possible, from your\\nstory, for monsieur lawrence to go to the poison cupboard. the\\npossibility had to be confirmed, or eliminated.”\\n\\n“poirot,” i said, “your gaiety does not deceive me. this is a very\\nimportant discovery.”\\n\\n“i do not know,” said poirot. “but one thing does strike me. no doubt\\nit has struck you too.”\\n\\n“what is that?”\\n\\n“why, that there is altogether too much strychnine about this case.\\nthis is the third time we run up against it. there was strychnine in\\nmrs. inglethorp’s tonic. there is the strychnine sold across the\\ncounter at styles st. mary by mace. now we have more strychnine,\\nhandled by one of the household. it is confusing; and, as you know, i\\ndo not like confusion.”\\n\\nbefore i could reply, one of the other belgians opened the door and\\nstuck his head in.\\n\\n“there is a lady below, asking for mr hastings.”\\n\\n“a lady?”\\n\\ni jumped up. poirot followed me down the narrow stairs. mary cavendish\\nwas standing in the doorway.\\n\\n“i have been visiting an old woman in the village,” she explained, “and\\nas lawrence told me you were with monsieur poirot i thought i would\\ncall for you.”\\n\\n“alas, madame,” said poirot, “i thought you had come to honour me with\\na visit!”\\n\\n“i will some day, if you ask me,” she promised him, smiling.\\n\\n“that is well. if you should need a father confessor, madame”—she\\nstarted ever so slightly—“remember, papa poirot is always at your\\nservice.”\\n\\nshe stared at him for a few minutes, as though seeking to read some\\ndeeper meaning into his words. then she turned abruptly away.\\n\\n“come, will you not walk back with us too, monsieur poirot?”\\n\\n“enchanted, madame.”\\n\\nall the way to styles, mary talked fast and feverishly. it struck me\\nthat in some way she was nervous of poirot’s eyes.\\n\\nthe weather had broken, and the sharp wind was almost autumnal in its\\nshrewishness. mary shivered a little, and buttoned her black sports\\ncoat closer. the wind through the trees made a mournful noise, like\\nsome great giant sighing.\\n\\nwe walked up to the great door of styles, and at once the knowledge\\ncame to us that something was wrong.\\n\\ndorcas came running out to meet us. she was crying and wringing her\\nhands. i was aware of other servants huddled together in the\\nbackground, all eyes and ears.\\n\\n“oh, m’am! oh, m’am! i don’t know how to tell you——”\\n\\n“what is it, dorcas?” i asked impatiently. “tell us at once.”\\n\\n“it’s those wicked detectives. they’ve arrested him—they’ve arrested\\nmr. cavendish!”\\n\\n“arrested lawrence?” i gasped.\\n\\ni saw a strange look come into dorcas’s eyes.\\n\\n“no, sir. not mr. lawrence—mr. john.”\\n\\nbehind me, with a wild cry, mary cavendish fell heavily against me, and\\nas i turned to catch her i met the quiet triumph in poirot’s eyes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xi.\\nthe case for the prosecution\\n\\n\\nthe trial of john cavendish for the murder of his stepmother took place\\ntwo months later.\\n\\nof the intervening weeks i will say little, but my admiration and\\nsympathy went out unfeignedly to mary cavendish. she ranged herself\\npassionately on her husband’s side, scorning the mere idea of his\\nguilt, and fought for him tooth and nail.\\n\\ni expressed my admiration to poirot, and he nodded thoughtfully.\\n\\n“yes, she is of those women who show at their best in adversity. it\\nbrings out all that is sweetest and truest in them. her pride and her\\njealousy have——”\\n\\n“jealousy?” i queried.\\n\\n“yes. have you not realized that she is an unusually jealous woman? as\\ni was saying, her pride and jealousy have been laid aside. she thinks\\nof nothing but her husband, and the terrible fate that is hanging over\\nhim.”\\n\\nhe spoke very feelingly, and i looked at him earnestly, remembering\\nthat last afternoon, when he had been deliberating whether or not to\\nspeak. with his tenderness for “a woman’s happiness,” i felt glad that\\nthe decision had been taken out of his hands.\\n\\n“even now,” i said, “i can hardly believe it. you see, up to the very\\nlast minute, i thought it was lawrence!”\\n\\npoirot grinned.\\n\\n“i know you did.”\\n\\n“but john! my old friend john!”\\n\\n“every murderer is probably somebody’s old friend,” observed poirot\\nphilosophically. “you cannot mix up sentiment and reason.”\\n\\n“i must say i think you might have given me a hint.”\\n\\n“perhaps, _mon ami_, i did not do so, just because he _was_ your old\\nfriend.”\\n\\ni was rather disconcerted by this, remembering how i had busily passed\\non to john what i believed to be poirot’s views concerning bauerstein.\\nhe, by the way, had been acquitted of the charge brought against him.\\nnevertheless, although he had been too clever for them this time, and\\nthe charge of espionage could not be brought home to him, his wings\\nwere pretty well clipped for the future.\\n\\ni asked poirot whether he thought john would be condemned. to my\\nintense surprise, he replied that, on the contrary, he was extremely\\nlikely to be acquitted.\\n\\n“but, poirot——” i protested.\\n\\n“oh, my friend, have i not said to you all along that i have no proofs.\\nit is one thing to know that a man is guilty, it is quite another\\nmatter to prove him so. and, in this case, there is terribly little\\nevidence. that is the whole trouble. i, hercule poirot, know, but i\\nlack the last link in my chain. and unless i can find that missing\\nlink——” he shook his head gravely.\\n\\n“when did you first suspect john cavendish?” i asked, after a minute or\\ntwo.\\n\\n“did you not suspect him at all?”\\n\\n“no, indeed.”\\n\\n“not after that fragment of conversation you overheard between mrs.\\ncavendish and her mother-in-law, and her subsequent lack of frankness\\nat the inquest?”\\n\\n“no.”\\n\\n“did you not put two and two together, and reflect that if it was not\\nalfred inglethorp who was quarrelling with his wife—and you remember,\\nhe strenuously denied it at the inquest—it must be either lawrence or\\njohn. now, if it was lawrence, mary cavendish’s conduct was just as\\ninexplicable. but if, on the other hand, it was john, the whole thing\\nwas explained quite naturally.”\\n\\n“so,” i cried, a light breaking in upon me, “it was john who quarrelled\\nwith his mother that afternoon?”\\n\\n“exactly.”\\n\\n“and you have known this all along?”\\n\\n“certainly. mrs. cavendish’s behaviour could only be explained that\\nway.”\\n\\n“and yet you say he may be acquitted?”\\n\\npoirot shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n“certainly i do. at the police court proceedings, we shall hear the\\ncase for the prosecution, but in all probability his solicitors will\\nadvise him to reserve his defence. that will be sprung upon us at the\\ntrial. and—ah, by the way, i have a word of caution to give you, my\\nfriend. i must not appear in the case.”\\n\\n“what?”\\n\\n“no. officially, i have nothing to do with it. until i have found that\\nlast link in my chain, i must remain behind the scenes. mrs. cavendish\\nmust think i am working for her husband, not against him.”\\n\\n“i say, that’s playing it a bit low down,” i protested.\\n\\n“not at all. we have to deal with a most clever and unscrupulous man,\\nand we must use any means in our power—otherwise he will slip through\\nour fingers. that is why i have been careful to remain in the\\nbackground. all the discoveries have been made by japp, and japp will\\ntake all the credit. if i am called upon to give evidence at all”—he\\nsmiled broadly—“it will probably be as a witness for the defence.”\\n\\ni could hardly believe my ears.\\n\\n“it is quite _en règle_,” continued poirot. “strangely enough, i can\\ngive evidence that will demolish one contention of the prosecution.”\\n\\n“which one?”\\n\\n“the one that relates to the destruction of the will. john cavendish\\ndid not destroy that will.”\\n\\npoirot was a true prophet. i will not go into the details of the police\\ncourt proceedings, as it involves many tiresome repetitions. i will\\nmerely state baldly that john cavendish reserved his defence, and was\\nduly committed for trial.\\n\\nseptember found us all in london. mary took a house in kensington,\\npoirot being included in the family party.\\n\\ni myself had been given a job at the war office, so was able to see\\nthem continually.\\n\\nas the weeks went by, the state of poirot’s nerves grew worse and\\nworse. that “last link” he talked about was still lacking. privately, i\\nhoped it might remain so, for what happiness could there be for mary,\\nif john were not acquitted?\\n\\non september 15th john cavendish appeared in the dock at the old\\nbailey, charged with “the wilful murder of emily agnes inglethorp,” and\\npleaded “not guilty.”\\n\\nsir ernest heavywether, the famous k.c., had been engaged to defend\\nhim.\\n\\nmr. philips, k.c., opened the case for the crown.\\n\\nthe murder, he said, was a most premeditated and cold-blooded one. it\\nwas neither more nor less than the deliberate poisoning of a fond and\\ntrusting woman by the stepson to whom she had been more than a mother.\\never since his boyhood, she had supported him. he and his wife had\\nlived at styles court in every luxury, surrounded by her care and\\nattention. she had been their kind and generous benefactress.\\n\\nhe proposed to call witnesses to show how the prisoner, a profligate\\nand spendthrift, had been at the end of his financial tether, and had\\nalso been carrying on an intrigue with a certain mrs. raikes, a\\nneighbouring farmer’s wife. this having come to his stepmother’s ears,\\nshe taxed him with it on the afternoon before her death, and a quarrel\\nensued, part of which was overheard. on the previous day, the prisoner\\nhad purchased strychnine at the village chemist’s shop, wearing a\\ndisguise by means of which he hoped to throw the onus of the crime upon\\nanother man—to wit, mrs. inglethorp’s husband, of whom he had been\\nbitterly jealous. luckily for mr. inglethorp, he had been able to\\nproduce an unimpeachable alibi.\\n\\non the afternoon of july 17th, continued counsel, immediately after the\\nquarrel with her son, mrs. inglethorp made a new will. this will was\\nfound destroyed in the grate of her bedroom the following morning, but\\nevidence had come to light which showed that it had been drawn up in\\nfavour of her husband. deceased had already made a will in his favour\\nbefore her marriage, but—and mr. philips wagged an expressive\\nforefinger—the prisoner was not aware of that. what had induced the\\ndeceased to make a fresh will, with the old one still extant, he could\\nnot say. she was an old lady, and might possibly have forgotten the\\nformer one; or—this seemed to him more likely—she may have had an idea\\nthat it was revoked by her marriage, as there had been some\\nconversation on the subject. ladies were not always very well versed in\\nlegal knowledge. she had, about a year before, executed a will in\\nfavour of the prisoner. he would call evidence to show that it was the\\nprisoner who ultimately handed his stepmother her coffee on the fatal\\nnight. later in the evening, he had sought admission to her room, on\\nwhich occasion, no doubt, he found an opportunity of destroying the\\nwill which, as far as he knew, would render the one in his favour\\nvalid.\\n\\nthe prisoner had been arrested in consequence of the discovery, in his\\nroom, by detective inspector japp—a most brilliant officer—of the\\nidentical phial of strychnine which had been sold at the village\\nchemist’s to the supposed mr. inglethorp on the day before the murder.\\nit would be for the jury to decide whether or not these damning facts\\nconstituted an overwhelming proof of the prisoner’s guilt.\\n\\nand, subtly implying that a jury which did not so decide, was quite\\nunthinkable, mr. philips sat down and wiped his forehead.\\n\\nthe first witnesses for the prosecution were mostly those who had been\\ncalled at the inquest, the medical evidence being again taken first.\\n\\nsir ernest heavywether, who was famous all over england for the\\nunscrupulous manner in which he bullied witnesses, only asked two\\nquestions.\\n\\n“i take it, dr. bauerstein, that strychnine, as a drug, acts quickly?”\\n\\n“yes.”\\n\\n“and that you are unable to account for the delay in this case?”\\n\\n“yes.”\\n\\n“thank you.”\\n\\nmr. mace identified the phial handed him by counsel as that sold by him\\nto “mr. inglethorp.” pressed, he admitted that he only knew mr.\\ninglethorp by sight. he had never spoken to him. the witness was not\\ncross-examined.\\n\\nalfred inglethorp was called, and denied having purchased the poison.\\nhe also denied having quarrelled with his wife. various witnesses\\ntestified to the accuracy of these statements.\\n\\nthe gardeners’ evidence, as to the witnessing of the will was taken,\\nand then dorcas was called.\\n\\ndorcas, faithful to her “young gentlemen,” denied strenuously that it\\ncould have been john’s voice she heard, and resolutely declared, in the\\nteeth of everything, that it was mr. inglethorp who had been in the\\nboudoir with her mistress. a rather wistful smile passed across the\\nface of the prisoner in the dock. he knew only too well how useless her\\ngallant defiance was, since it was not the object of the defence to\\ndeny this point. mrs. cavendish, of course, could not be called upon to\\ngive evidence against her husband.\\n\\nafter various questions on other matters, mr. philips asked:\\n\\n“in the month of june last, do you remember a parcel arriving for mr.\\nlawrence cavendish from parkson’s?”\\n\\ndorcas shook her head.\\n\\n“i don’t remember, sir. it may have done, but mr. lawrence was away\\nfrom home part of june.”\\n\\n“in the event of a parcel arriving for him whilst he was away, what\\nwould be done with it?”\\n\\n“it would either be put in his room or sent on after him.”\\n\\n“by you?”\\n\\n“no, sir, i should leave it on the hall table. it would be miss howard\\nwho would attend to anything like that.”\\n\\nevelyn howard was called and, after being examined on other points, was\\nquestioned as to the parcel.\\n\\n“don’t remember. lots of parcels come. can’t remember one special one.”\\n\\n“you do not know if it was sent after mr. lawrence cavendish to wales,\\nor whether it was put in his room?”\\n\\n“don’t think it was sent after him. should have remembered it if it\\nwas.”\\n\\n“supposing a parcel arrived addressed to mr. lawrence cavendish, and\\nafterwards it disappeared, should you remark its absence?”\\n\\n“no, don’t think so. i should think someone had taken charge of it.”\\n\\n“i believe, miss howard, that it was you who found this sheet of brown\\npaper?” he held up the same dusty piece which poirot and i had examined\\nin the morning-room at styles.\\n\\n“yes, i did.”\\n\\n“how did you come to look for it?”\\n\\n“the belgian detective who was employed on the case asked me to search\\nfor it.”\\n\\n“where did you eventually discover it?”\\n\\n“on the top of—of—a wardrobe.”\\n\\n“on top of the prisoner’s wardrobe?”\\n\\n“i—i believe so.”\\n\\n“did you not find it yourself?”\\n\\n“yes.”\\n\\n“then you must know where you found it?”\\n\\n“yes, it was on the prisoner’s wardrobe.”\\n\\n“that is better.”\\n\\nan assistant from parkson’s, theatrical costumiers, testified that on\\njune 29th, they had supplied a black beard to mr. l. cavendish, as\\nrequested. it was ordered by letter, and a postal order was enclosed.\\nno, they had not kept the letter. all transactions were entered in\\ntheir books. they had sent the beard, as directed, to “l. cavendish,\\nesq., styles court.”\\n\\nsir ernest heavywether rose ponderously.\\n\\n“where was the letter written from?”\\n\\n“from styles court.”\\n\\n“the same address to which you sent the parcel?”\\n\\n“yes.”\\n\\n“and the letter came from there?”\\n\\n“yes.”\\n\\nlike a beast of prey, heavywether fell upon him:\\n\\n“how do you know?”\\n\\n“i—i don’t understand.”\\n\\n“how do you know that letter came from styles? did you notice the\\npostmark?”\\n\\n“no—but——”\\n\\n“ah, you did _not_ notice the postmark! and yet you affirm so\\nconfidently that it came from styles. it might, in fact, have been any\\npostmark?”\\n\\n“y—es.”\\n\\n“in fact, the letter, though written on stamped notepaper, might have\\nbeen posted from anywhere? from wales, for instance?”\\n\\nthe witness admitted that such might be the case, and sir ernest\\nsignified that he was satisfied.\\n\\nelizabeth wells, second housemaid at styles, stated that after she had\\ngone to bed she remembered that she had bolted the front door, instead\\nof leaving it on the latch as mr. inglethorp had requested. she had\\naccordingly gone downstairs again to rectify her error. hearing a\\nslight noise in the west wing, she had peeped along the passage, and\\nhad seen mr. john cavendish knocking at mrs. inglethorp’s door.\\n\\nsir ernest heavywether made short work of her, and under his unmerciful\\nbullying she contradicted herself hopelessly, and sir ernest sat down\\nagain with a satisfied smile on his face.\\n\\nwith the evidence of annie, as to the candle grease on the floor, and\\nas to seeing the prisoner take the coffee into the boudoir, the\\nproceedings were adjourned until the following day.\\n\\nas we went home, mary cavendish spoke bitterly against the prosecuting\\ncounsel.\\n\\n“that hateful man! what a net he has drawn around my poor john! how he\\ntwisted every little fact until he made it seem what it wasn’t!”\\n\\n“well,” i said consolingly, “it will be the other way about to-morrow.”\\n\\n“yes,” she said meditatively; then suddenly dropped her voice. “mr.\\nhastings, you do not think—surely it could not have been lawrence—oh,\\nno, that could not be!”\\n\\nbut i myself was puzzled, and as soon as i was alone with poirot i\\nasked him what he thought sir ernest was driving at.\\n\\n“ah!” said poirot appreciatively. “he is a clever man, that sir\\nernest.”\\n\\n“do you think he believes lawrence guilty?”\\n\\n“i do not think he believes or cares anything! no, what he is trying\\nfor is to create such confusion in the minds of the jury that they are\\ndivided in their opinion as to which brother did it. he is endeavouring\\nto make out that there is quite as much evidence against lawrence as\\nagainst john—and i am not at all sure that he will not succeed.”\\n\\ndetective-inspector japp was the first witness called when the trial\\nwas reopened, and gave his evidence succinctly and briefly. after\\nrelating the earlier events, he proceeded:\\n\\n“acting on information received, superintendent summerhaye and myself\\nsearched the prisoner’s room, during his temporary absence from the\\nhouse. in his chest of drawers, hidden beneath some underclothing, we\\nfound: first, a pair of gold-rimmed pince-nez similar to those worn by\\nmr. inglethorp”—these were exhibited—“secondly, this phial.”\\n\\nthe phial was that already recognized by the chemist’s assistant, a\\ntiny bottle of blue glass, containing a few grains of a white\\ncrystalline powder, and labelled: “strychnine hydro-chloride. poison.”\\n\\na fresh piece of evidence discovered by the detectives since the police\\ncourt proceedings was a long, almost new piece of blotting-paper. it\\nhad been found in mrs. inglethorp’s cheque book, and on being reversed\\nat a mirror, showed clearly the words: “. . . erything of which i die\\npossessed i leave to my beloved husband alfred ing...” this placed\\nbeyond question the fact that the destroyed will had been in favour of\\nthe deceased lady’s husband. japp then produced the charred fragment of\\npaper recovered from the grate, and this, with the discovery of the\\nbeard in the attic, completed his evidence.\\n\\nbut sir ernest’s cross-examination was yet to come.\\n\\n“what day was it when you searched the prisoner’s room?”\\n\\n“tuesday, the 24th of july.”\\n\\n“exactly a week after the tragedy?”\\n\\n“yes.”\\n\\n“you found these two objects, you say, in the chest of drawers. was the\\ndrawer unlocked?”\\n\\n“yes.”\\n\\n“does it not strike you as unlikely that a man who had committed a\\ncrime should keep the evidence of it in an unlocked drawer for anyone\\nto find?”\\n\\n“he might have stowed them there in a hurry.”\\n\\n“but you have just said it was a whole week since the crime. he would\\nhave had ample time to remove them and destroy them.”\\n\\n“perhaps.”\\n\\n“there is no perhaps about it. would he, or would he not have had\\nplenty of time to remove and destroy them?”\\n\\n“yes.”\\n\\n“was the pile of underclothes under which the things were hidden heavy\\nor light?”\\n\\n“heavyish.”\\n\\n“in other words, it was winter underclothing. obviously, the prisoner\\nwould not be likely to go to that drawer?”\\n\\n“perhaps not.”\\n\\n“kindly answer my question. would the prisoner, in the hottest week of\\na hot summer, be likely to go to a drawer containing winter\\nunderclothing. yes, or no?”\\n\\n“no.”\\n\\n“in that case, is it not possible that the articles in question might\\nhave been put there by a third person, and that the prisoner was quite\\nunaware of their presence?”\\n\\n“i should not think it likely.”\\n\\n“but it is possible?”\\n\\n“yes.”\\n\\n“that is all.”\\n\\nmore evidence followed. evidence as to the financial difficulties in\\nwhich the prisoner had found himself at the end of july. evidence as to\\nhis intrigue with mrs. raikes—poor mary, that must have been bitter\\nhearing for a woman of her pride. evelyn howard had been right in her\\nfacts, though her animosity against alfred inglethorp had caused her to\\njump to the conclusion that he was the person concerned.\\n\\nlawrence cavendish was then put into the box. in a low voice, in answer\\nto mr. philips’ questions, he denied having ordered anything from\\nparkson’s in june. in fact, on june 29th, he had been staying away, in\\nwales.\\n\\ninstantly, sir ernest’s chin was shooting pugnaciously forward.\\n\\n“you deny having ordered a black beard from parkson’s on june 29th?”\\n\\n“i do.”\\n\\n“ah! in the event of anything happening to your brother, who will\\ninherit styles court?”\\n\\nthe brutality of the question called a flush to lawrence’s pale face.\\nthe judge gave vent to a faint murmur of disapprobation, and the\\nprisoner in the dock leant forward angrily.\\n\\nheavywether cared nothing for his client’s anger.\\n\\n“answer my question, if you please.”\\n\\n“i suppose,” said lawrence quietly, “that i should.”\\n\\n“what do you mean by you ‘suppose’? your brother has no children. you\\n_would_ inherit it, wouldn’t you?”\\n\\n“yes.”\\n\\n“ah, that’s better,” said heavywether, with ferocious geniality. “and\\nyou’d inherit a good slice of money too, wouldn’t you?”\\n\\n“really, sir ernest,” protested the judge, “these questions are not\\nrelevant.”\\n\\nsir ernest bowed, and having shot his arrow proceeded.\\n\\n“on tuesday, the 17th july, you went, i believe, with another guest, to\\nvisit the dispensary at the red cross hospital in tadminster?”\\n\\n“yes.”\\n\\n“did you—while you happened to be alone for a few seconds—unlock the\\npoison cupboard, and examine some of the bottles?”\\n\\n“i—i—may have done so.”\\n\\n“i put it to you that you did do so?”\\n\\n“yes.”\\n\\nsir ernest fairly shot the next question at him.\\n\\n“did you examine one bottle in particular?”\\n\\n“no, i do not think so.”\\n\\n“be careful, mr. cavendish. i am referring to a little bottle of\\nhydro-chloride of strychnine.”\\n\\nlawrence was turning a sickly greenish colour.\\n\\n“n—o—i am sure i didn’t.”\\n\\n“then how do you account for the fact that you left the unmistakable\\nimpress of your finger-prints on it?”\\n\\nthe bullying manner was highly efficacious with a nervous disposition.\\n\\n“i—i suppose i must have taken up the bottle.”\\n\\n“i suppose so too! did you abstract any of the contents of the bottle?”\\n\\n“certainly not.”\\n\\n“then why did you take it up?”\\n\\n“i once studied to be a doctor. such things naturally interest me.”\\n\\n“ah! so poisons ‘naturally interest’ you, do they? still, you waited to\\nbe alone before gratifying that ‘interest’ of yours?”\\n\\n“that was pure chance. if the others had been there, i should have done\\njust the same.”\\n\\n“still, as it happens, the others were not there?”\\n\\n“no, but——”\\n\\n“in fact, during the whole afternoon, you were only alone for a couple\\nof minutes, and it happened—i say, it happened—to be during those two\\nminutes that you displayed your ‘natural interest’ in hydro-chloride of\\nstrychnine?”\\n\\nlawrence stammered pitiably.\\n\\n“i—i——”\\n\\nwith a satisfied and expressive countenance, sir ernest observed:\\n\\n“i have nothing more to ask you, mr. cavendish.”\\n\\nthis bit of cross-examination had caused great excitement in court. the\\nheads of the many fashionably attired women present were busily laid\\ntogether, and their whispers became so loud that the judge angrily\\nthreatened to have the court cleared if there was not immediate\\nsilence.\\n\\nthere was little more evidence. the hand-writing experts were called\\nupon for their opinion of the signature of “alfred inglethorp” in the\\nchemist’s poison register. they all declared unanimously that it was\\ncertainly not his hand-writing, and gave it as their view that it might\\nbe that of the prisoner disguised. cross-examined, they admitted that\\nit might be the prisoner’s hand-writing cleverly counterfeited.\\n\\nsir ernest heavywether’s speech in opening the case for the defence was\\nnot a long one, but it was backed by the full force of his emphatic\\nmanner. never, he said, in the course of his long experience, had he\\nknown a charge of murder rest on slighter evidence. not only was it\\nentirely circumstantial, but the greater part of it was practically\\nunproved. let them take the testimony they had heard and sift it\\nimpartially. the strychnine had been found in a drawer in the\\nprisoner’s room. that drawer was an unlocked one, as he had pointed\\nout, and he submitted that there was no evidence to prove that it was\\nthe prisoner who had concealed the poison there. it was, in fact, a\\nwicked and malicious attempt on the part of some third person to fix\\nthe crime on the prisoner. the prosecution had been unable to produce a\\nshred of evidence in support of their contention that it was the\\nprisoner who ordered the black beard from parkson’s. the quarrel which\\nhad taken place between prisoner and his stepmother was freely\\nadmitted, but both it and his financial embarrassments had been grossly\\nexaggerated.\\n\\nhis learned friend—sir ernest nodded carelessly at mr. philips—had\\nstated that if the prisoner were an innocent man, he would have come\\nforward at the inquest to explain that it was he, and not mr.\\ninglethorp, who had been the participator in the quarrel. he thought\\nthe facts had been misrepresented. what had actually occurred was this.\\nthe prisoner, returning to the house on tuesday evening, had been\\nauthoritatively told that there had been a violent quarrel between mr.\\nand mrs. inglethorp. no suspicion had entered the prisoner’s head that\\nanyone could possibly have mistaken his voice for that of mr.\\ninglethorp. he naturally concluded that his stepmother had had two\\nquarrels.\\n\\nthe prosecution averred that on monday, july 16th, the prisoner had\\nentered the chemist’s shop in the village, disguised as mr. inglethorp.\\nthe prisoner, on the contrary, was at that time at a lonely spot called\\nmarston’s spinney, where he had been summoned by an anonymous note,\\ncouched in blackmailing terms, and threatening to reveal certain\\nmatters to his wife unless he complied with its demands. the prisoner\\nhad, accordingly, gone to the appointed spot, and after waiting there\\nvainly for half an hour had returned home. unfortunately, he had met\\nwith no one on the way there or back who could vouch for the truth of\\nhis story, but luckily he had kept the note, and it would be produced\\nas evidence.\\n\\nas for the statement relating to the destruction of the will, the\\nprisoner had formerly practised at the bar, and was perfectly well\\naware that the will made in his favour a year before was automatically\\nrevoked by his stepmother’s remarriage. he would call evidence to show\\nwho did destroy the will, and it was possible that that might open up\\nquite a new view of the case.\\n\\nfinally, he would point out to the jury that there was evidence against\\nother people besides john cavendish. he would direct their attention to\\nthe fact that the evidence against mr. lawrence cavendish was quite as\\nstrong, if not stronger than that against his brother.\\n\\nhe would now call the prisoner.\\n\\njohn acquitted himself well in the witness-box. under sir ernest’s\\nskilful handling, he told his tale credibly and well. the anonymous\\nnote received by him was produced, and handed to the jury to examine.\\nthe readiness with which he admitted his financial difficulties, and\\nthe disagreement with his stepmother, lent value to his denials.\\n\\nat the close of his examination, he paused, and said:\\n\\n“i should like to make one thing clear. i utterly reject and disapprove\\nof sir ernest heavywether’s insinuations against my brother. my\\nbrother, i am convinced, had no more to do with the crime than i have.”\\n\\nsir ernest merely smiled, and noted with a sharp eye that john’s\\nprotest had produced a very favourable impression on the jury.\\n\\nthen the cross-examination began.\\n\\n“i understand you to say that it never entered your head that the\\nwitnesses at the inquest could possibly have mistaken your voice for\\nthat of mr. inglethorp. is not that very surprising?”\\n\\n“no, i don’t think so. i was told there had been a quarrel between my\\nmother and mr. inglethorp, and it never occurred to me that such was\\nnot really the case.”\\n\\n“not when the servant dorcas repeated certain fragments of the\\nconversation—fragments which you must have recognized?”\\n\\n“i did not recognize them.”\\n\\n“your memory must be unusually short!”\\n\\n“no, but we were both angry, and, i think, said more than we meant. i\\npaid very little attention to my mother’s actual words.”\\n\\nmr. philips’ incredulous sniff was a triumph of forensic skill. he\\npassed on to the subject of the note.\\n\\n“you have produced this note very opportunely. tell me, is there\\nnothing familiar about the hand-writing of it?”\\n\\n“not that i know of.”\\n\\n“do you not think that it bears a marked resemblance to your own\\nhand-writing—carelessly disguised?”\\n\\n“no, i do not think so.”\\n\\n“i put it to you that it is your own hand-writing!”\\n\\n“no.”\\n\\n“i put it to you that, anxious to prove an alibi, you conceived the\\nidea of a fictitious and rather incredible appointment, and wrote this\\nnote yourself in order to bear out your statement!”\\n\\n“no.”\\n\\n“is it not a fact that, at the time you claim to have been waiting\\nabout at a solitary and unfrequented spot, you were really in the\\nchemist’s shop in styles st. mary, where you purchased strychnine in\\nthe name of alfred inglethorp?”\\n\\n“no, that is a lie.”\\n\\n“i put it to you that, wearing a suit of mr. inglethorp’s clothes, with\\na black beard trimmed to resemble his, you were there—and signed the\\nregister in his name!”\\n\\n“that is absolutely untrue.”\\n\\n“then i will leave the remarkable similarity of hand-writing between\\nthe note, the register, and your own, to the consideration of the\\njury,” said mr. philips, and sat down with the air of a man who has\\ndone his duty, but who was nevertheless horrified by such deliberate\\nperjury.\\n\\nafter this, as it was growing late, the case was adjourned till monday.\\n\\npoirot, i noticed, was looking profoundly discouraged. he had that\\nlittle frown between the eyes that i knew so well.\\n\\n“what is it, poirot?” i inquired.\\n\\n“ah, _mon ami_, things are going badly, badly.”\\n\\nin spite of myself, my heart gave a leap of relief. evidently there was\\na likelihood of john cavendish being acquitted.\\n\\nwhen we reached the house, my little friend waved aside mary’s offer of\\ntea.\\n\\n“no, i thank you, madame. i will mount to my room.”\\n\\ni followed him. still frowning, he went across to the desk and took out\\na small pack of patience cards. then he drew up a chair to the table,\\nand, to my utter amazement, began solemnly to build card houses!\\n\\nmy jaw dropped involuntarily, and he said at once:\\n\\n“no, _mon ami_, i am not in my second childhood! i steady my nerves,\\nthat is all. this employment requires precision of the fingers. with\\nprecision of the fingers goes precision of the brain. and never have i\\nneeded that more than now!”\\n\\n“what is the trouble?” i asked.\\n\\nwith a great thump on the table, poirot demolished his carefully built\\nup edifice.\\n\\n“it is this, _mon ami!_ that i can build card houses seven stories\\nhigh, but i cannot”—thump—“find”—thump—“ that last link of which i\\nspoke to you.”\\n\\ni could not quite tell what to say, so i held my peace, and he began\\nslowly building up the cards again, speaking in jerks as he did so.\\n\\n“it is done—so! by placing—one card—on another—with\\nmathematical—precision!”\\n\\ni watched the card house rising under his hands, story by story. he\\nnever hesitated or faltered. it was really almost like a conjuring\\ntrick.\\n\\n“what a steady hand you’ve got,” i remarked. “i believe i’ve only seen\\nyour hand shake once.”\\n\\n“on an occasion when i was enraged, without doubt,” observed poirot,\\nwith great placidity.\\n\\n“yes indeed! you were in a towering rage. do you remember? it was when\\nyou discovered that the lock of the despatch-case in mrs. inglethorp’s\\nbedroom had been forced. you stood by the mantelpiece, twiddling the\\nthings on it in your usual fashion, and your hand shook like a leaf! i\\nmust say——”\\n\\nbut i stopped suddenly. for poirot, uttering a hoarse and inarticulate\\ncry, again annihilated his masterpiece of cards, and putting his hands\\nover his eyes swayed backwards and forwards, apparently suffering the\\nkeenest agony.\\n\\n“good heavens, poirot!” i cried. “what is the matter? are you taken\\nill?”\\n\\n“no, no,” he gasped. “it is—it is—that i have an idea!”\\n\\n“oh!” i exclaimed, much relieved. “one of your ‘little ideas’?”\\n\\n“ah, _ma foi_, no!” replied poirot frankly. “this time it is an idea\\ngigantic! stupendous! and you—_you_, my friend, have given it to me!”\\n\\nsuddenly clasping me in his arms, he kissed me warmly on both cheeks,\\nand before i had recovered from my surprise ran headlong from the room.\\n\\nmary cavendish entered at that moment.\\n\\n“what _is_ the matter with monsieur poirot? he rushed past me crying\\nout: ‘a garage! for the love of heaven, direct me to a garage, madame!’\\nand, before i could answer, he had dashed out into the street.”\\n\\ni hurried to the window. true enough, there he was, tearing down the\\nstreet, hatless, and gesticulating as he went. i turned to mary with a\\ngesture of despair.\\n\\n“he’ll be stopped by a policeman in another minute. there he goes,\\nround the corner!”\\n\\nour eyes met, and we stared helplessly at one another.\\n\\n“what can be the matter?”\\n\\ni shook my head.\\n\\n“i don’t know. he was building card houses, when suddenly he said he\\nhad an idea, and rushed off as you saw.”\\n\\n“well,” said mary, “i expect he will be back before dinner.”\\n\\nbut night fell, and poirot had not returned.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xii.\\nthe last link\\n\\n\\npoirot’s abrupt departure had intrigued us all greatly. sunday morning\\nwore away, and still he did not reappear. but about three o’clock a\\nferocious and prolonged hooting outside drove us to the window, to see\\npoirot alighting from a car, accompanied by japp and summerhaye. the\\nlittle man was transformed. he radiated an absurd complacency. he bowed\\nwith exaggerated respect to mary cavendish.\\n\\n“madame, i have your permission to hold a little _réunion_ in the\\n_salon_? it is necessary for everyone to attend.”\\n\\nmary smiled sadly.\\n\\n“you know, monsieur poirot, that you have _carte blanche_ in every\\nway.”\\n\\n“you are too amiable, madame.”\\n\\nstill beaming, poirot marshalled us all into the drawing-room, bringing\\nforward chairs as he did so.\\n\\n“miss howard—here. mademoiselle cynthia. monsieur lawrence. the good\\ndorcas. and annie. _bien!_ we must delay our proceedings a few minutes\\nuntil mr. inglethorp arrives. i have sent him a note.”\\n\\nmiss howard rose immediately from her seat.\\n\\n“if that man comes into the house, i leave it!”\\n\\n“no, no!” poirot went up to her and pleaded in a low voice.\\n\\nfinally miss howard consented to return to her chair. a few minutes\\nlater alfred inglethorp entered the room.\\n\\nthe company once assembled, poirot rose from his seat with the air of a\\npopular lecturer, and bowed politely to his audience.\\n\\n“_messieurs, mesdames_, as you all know, i was called in by monsieur\\njohn cavendish to investigate this case. i at once examined the bedroom\\nof the deceased which, by the advice of the doctors, had been kept\\nlocked, and was consequently exactly as it had been when the tragedy\\noccurred. i found: first, a fragment of green material; second, a stain\\non the carpet near the window, still damp; thirdly, an empty box of\\nbromide powders.\\n\\n“to take the fragment of green material first, i found it caught in the\\nbolt of the communicating door between that room and the adjoining one\\noccupied by mademoiselle cynthia. i handed the fragment over to the\\npolice who did not consider it of much importance. nor did they\\nrecognize it for what it was—a piece torn from a green land armlet.”\\n\\nthere was a little stir of excitement.\\n\\n“now there was only one person at styles who worked on the land—mrs.\\ncavendish. therefore it must have been mrs. cavendish who entered the\\ndeceased’s room through the door communicating with mademoiselle\\ncynthia’s room.”\\n\\n“but that door was bolted on the inside!” i cried.\\n\\n“when i examined the room, yes. but in the first place we have only her\\nword for it, since it was she who tried that particular door and\\nreported it fastened. in the ensuing confusion she would have had ample\\nopportunity to shoot the bolt across. i took an early opportunity of\\nverifying my conjectures. to begin with, the fragment corresponds\\nexactly with a tear in mrs. cavendish’s armlet. also, at the inquest,\\nmrs. cavendish declared that she had heard, from her own room, the fall\\nof the table by the bed. i took an early opportunity of testing that\\nstatement by stationing my friend monsieur hastings in the left wing of\\nthe building, just outside mrs. cavendish’s door. i myself, in company\\nwith the police, went to the deceased’s room, and whilst there i,\\napparently accidentally, knocked over the table in question, but found\\nthat, as i had expected, monsieur hastings had heard no sound at all.\\nthis confirmed my belief that mrs. cavendish was not speaking the truth\\nwhen she declared that she had been dressing in her room at the time of\\nthe tragedy. in fact, i was convinced that, far from having been in her\\nown room, mrs. cavendish was actually in the deceased’s room when the\\nalarm was given.”\\n\\ni shot a quick glance at mary. she was very pale, but smiling.\\n\\n“i proceeded to reason on that assumption. mrs. cavendish is in her\\nmother-in-law’s room. we will say that she is seeking for something and\\nhas not yet found it. suddenly mrs. inglethorp awakens and is seized\\nwith an alarming paroxysm. she flings out her arm, overturning the bed\\ntable, and then pulls desperately at the bell. mrs. cavendish,\\nstartled, drops her candle, scattering the grease on the carpet. she\\npicks it up, and retreats quickly to mademoiselle cynthia’s room,\\nclosing the door behind her. she hurries out into the passage, for the\\nservants must not find her where she is. but it is too late! already\\nfootsteps are echoing along the gallery which connects the two wings.\\nwhat can she do? quick as thought, she hurries back to the young girl’s\\nroom, and starts shaking her awake. the hastily aroused household come\\ntrooping down the passage. they are all busily battering at mrs.\\ninglethorp’s door. it occurs to nobody that mrs. cavendish has not\\narrived with the rest, but—and this is significant—i can find no one\\nwho saw her come from the other wing.” he looked at mary cavendish. “am\\ni right, madame?”\\n\\nshe bowed her head.\\n\\n“quite right, monsieur. you understand that, if i had thought i would\\ndo my husband any good by revealing these facts, i would have done so.\\nbut it did not seem to me to bear upon the question of his guilt or\\ninnocence.”\\n\\n“in a sense, that is correct, madame. but it cleared my mind of many\\nmisconceptions, and left me free to see other facts in their true\\nsignificance.”\\n\\n“the will!” cried lawrence. “then it was you, mary, who destroyed the\\nwill?”\\n\\nshe shook her head, and poirot shook his also.\\n\\n“no,” he said quietly. “there is only one person who could possibly\\nhave destroyed that will—mrs. inglethorp herself!”\\n\\n“impossible!” i exclaimed. “she had only made it out that very\\nafternoon!”\\n\\n“nevertheless, _mon ami_, it was mrs. inglethorp. because, in no other\\nway can you account for the fact that, on one of the hottest days of\\nthe year, mrs. inglethorp ordered a fire to be lighted in her room.”\\n\\ni gave a gasp. what idiots we had been never to think of that fire as\\nbeing incongruous! poirot was continuing:\\n\\n“the temperature on that day, messieurs, was 80 degrees in the shade.\\nyet mrs. inglethorp ordered a fire! why? because she wished to destroy\\nsomething, and could think of no other way. you will remember that, in\\nconsequence of the war economics practiced at styles, no waste paper\\nwas thrown away. there was therefore no means of destroying a thick\\ndocument such as a will. the moment i heard of a fire being lighted in\\nmrs. inglethorp’s room, i leaped to the conclusion that it was to\\ndestroy some important document—possibly a will. so the discovery of\\nthe charred fragment in the grate was no surprise to me. i did not, of\\ncourse, know at the time that the will in question had only been made\\nthis afternoon, and i will admit that, when i learnt that fact, i fell\\ninto a grievous error. i came to the conclusion that mrs. inglethorp’s\\ndetermination to destroy her will arose as a direct consequence of the\\nquarrel she had that afternoon, and that therefore the quarrel took\\nplace after, and not before the making of the will.\\n\\n“here, as we know, i was wrong, and i was forced to abandon that idea.\\ni faced the problem from a new standpoint. now, at four o’clock, dorcas\\noverheard her mistress saying angrily: ‘you need not think that any\\nfear of publicity, or scandal between husband and wife will deter me.”\\ni conjectured, and conjectured rightly, that these words were\\naddressed, not to her husband, but to mr. john cavendish. at five\\no’clock, an hour later, she uses almost the same words, but the\\nstandpoint is different. she admits to dorcas, ‘i don’t know what to\\ndo; scandal between husband and wife is a dreadful thing.’ at four\\no’clock she has been angry, but completely mistress of herself. at five\\no’clock she is in violent distress, and speaks of having had a great\\nshock.\\n\\n“looking at the matter psychologically, i drew one deduction which i\\nwas convinced was correct. the second ‘scandal’ she spoke of was not\\nthe same as the first—and it concerned herself!\\n\\n“let us reconstruct. at four o’clock, mrs. inglethorp quarrels with her\\nson, and threatens to denounce him to his wife—who, by the way,\\noverheard the greater part of the conversation. at four-thirty, mrs.\\ninglethorp, in consequence of a conversation on the validity of wills,\\nmakes a will in favour of her husband, which the two gardeners witness.\\nat five o’clock, dorcas finds her mistress in a state of considerable\\nagitation, with a slip of paper—‘a letter,’ dorcas thinks—in her hand,\\nand it is then that she orders the fire in her room to be lighted.\\npresumably, then, between four-thirty and five o’clock, something has\\noccurred to occasion a complete revolution of feeling, since she is now\\nas anxious to destroy the will, as she was before to make it. what was\\nthat something?\\n\\n“as far as we know, she was quite alone during that half-hour. nobody\\nentered or left that boudoir. what then occasioned this sudden change\\nof sentiment?\\n\\n“one can only guess, but i believe my guess to be correct. mrs.\\ninglethorp had no stamps in her desk. we know this, because later she\\nasked dorcas to bring her some. now in the opposite corner of the room\\nstood her husband’s desk—locked. she was anxious to find some stamps,\\nand, according to my theory, she tried her own keys in the desk. that\\none of them fitted i know. she therefore opened the desk, and in\\nsearching for the stamps she came across something else—that slip of\\npaper which dorcas saw in her hand, and which assuredly was never meant\\nfor mrs. inglethorp’s eyes. on the other hand, mrs. cavendish believed\\nthat the slip of paper to which her mother-in-law clung so tenaciously\\nwas a written proof of her own husband’s infidelity. she demanded it\\nfrom mrs. inglethorp who assured her, quite truly, that it had nothing\\nto do with that matter. mrs. cavendish did not believe her. she thought\\nthat mrs. inglethorp was shielding her stepson. now mrs. cavendish is a\\nvery resolute woman, and, behind her mask of reserve, she was madly\\njealous of her husband. she determined to get hold of that paper at all\\ncosts, and in this resolution chance came to her aid. she happened to\\npick up the key of mrs. inglethorp’s despatch-case, which had been lost\\nthat morning. she knew that her mother-in-law invariably kept all\\nimportant papers in this particular case.\\n\\n“mrs. cavendish, therefore, made her plans as only a woman driven\\ndesperate through jealousy could have done. some time in the evening\\nshe unbolted the door leading into mademoiselle cynthia’s room.\\npossibly she applied oil to the hinges, for i found that it opened\\nquite noiselessly when i tried it. she put off her project until the\\nearly hours of the morning as being safer, since the servants were\\naccustomed to hearing her move about her room at that time. she dressed\\ncompletely in her land kit, and made her way quietly through\\nmademoiselle cynthia’s room into that of mrs. inglethorp.”\\n\\nhe paused a moment, and cynthia interrupted:\\n\\n“but i should have woken up if anyone had come through my room?”\\n\\n“not if you were drugged, mademoiselle.”\\n\\n“drugged?”\\n\\n“_mais, oui!_”\\n\\n“you remember”—he addressed us collectively again—“that through all the\\ntumult and noise next door mademoiselle cynthia slept. that admitted of\\ntwo possibilities. either her sleep was feigned—which i did not\\nbelieve—or her unconsciousness was induced by artificial means.\\n\\n“with this latter idea in my mind, i examined all the coffee-cups most\\ncarefully, remembering that it was mrs. cavendish who had brought\\nmademoiselle cynthia her coffee the night before. i took a sample from\\neach cup, and had them analysed—with no result. i had counted the cups\\ncarefully, in the event of one having been removed. six persons had\\ntaken coffee, and six cups were duly found. i had to confess myself\\nmistaken.\\n\\n“then i discovered that i had been guilty of a very grave oversight.\\ncoffee had been brought in for seven persons, not six, for dr.\\nbauerstein had been there that evening. this changed the face of the\\nwhole affair, for there was now one cup missing. the servants noticed\\nnothing, since annie, the housemaid, who took in the coffee, brought in\\nseven cups, not knowing that mr. inglethorp never drank it, whereas\\ndorcas, who cleared them away the following morning, found six as\\nusual—or strictly speaking she found five, the sixth being the one\\nfound broken in mrs. inglethorp’s room.\\n\\n“i was confident that the missing cup was that of mademoiselle cynthia.\\ni had an additional reason for that belief in the fact that all the\\ncups found contained sugar, which mademoiselle cynthia never took in\\nher coffee. my attention was attracted by the story of annie about some\\n‘salt’ on the tray of cocoa which she took every night to mrs.\\ninglethorp’s room. i accordingly secured a sample of that cocoa, and\\nsent it to be analysed.”\\n\\n“but that had already been done by dr. bauerstein,” said lawrence\\nquickly.\\n\\n“not exactly. the analyst was asked by him to report whether strychnine\\nwas, or was not, present. he did not have it tested, as i did, for a\\nnarcotic.”\\n\\n“for a narcotic?”\\n\\n“yes. here is the analyst’s report. mrs. cavendish administered a safe,\\nbut effectual, narcotic to both mrs. inglethorp and mademoiselle\\ncynthia. and it is possible that she had a _mauvais quart d’heure_ in\\nconsequence! imagine her feelings when her mother-in-law is suddenly\\ntaken ill and dies, and immediately after she hears the word ‘poison’!\\nshe has believed that the sleeping draught she administered was\\nperfectly harmless, but there is no doubt that for one terrible moment\\nshe must have feared that mrs. inglethorp’s death lay at her door. she\\nis seized with panic, and under its influence she hurries downstairs,\\nand quickly drops the coffee-cup and saucer used by mademoiselle\\ncynthia into a large brass vase, where it is discovered later by\\nmonsieur lawrence. the remains of the cocoa she dare not touch. too\\nmany eyes are upon her. guess at her relief when strychnine is\\nmentioned, and she discovers that after all the tragedy is not her\\ndoing.\\n\\n“we are now able to account for the symptoms of strychnine poisoning\\nbeing so long in making their appearance. a narcotic taken with\\nstrychnine will delay the action of the poison for some hours.”\\n\\npoirot paused. mary looked up at him, the colour slowly rising in her\\nface.\\n\\n“all you have said is quite true, monsieur poirot. it was the most\\nawful hour of my life. i shall never forget it. but you are wonderful.\\ni understand now——”\\n\\n“what i meant when i told you that you could safely confess to papa\\npoirot, eh? but you would not trust me.”\\n\\n“i see everything now,” said lawrence. “the drugged cocoa, taken on top\\nof the poisoned coffee, amply accounts for the delay.”\\n\\n“exactly. but was the coffee poisoned, or was it not? we come to a\\nlittle difficulty here, since mrs. inglethorp never drank it.”\\n\\n“what?” the cry of surprise was universal.\\n\\n“no. you will remember my speaking of a stain on the carpet in mrs.\\ninglethorp’s room? there were some peculiar points about that stain. it\\nwas still damp, it exhaled a strong odour of coffee, and imbedded in\\nthe nap of the carpet i found some little splinters of china. what had\\nhappened was plain to me, for not two minutes before i had placed my\\nlittle case on the table near the window, and the table, tilting up,\\nhad deposited it upon the floor on precisely the identical spot. in\\nexactly the same way, mrs. inglethorp had laid down her cup of coffee\\non reaching her room the night before, and the treacherous table had\\nplayed her the same trick.\\n\\n“what happened next is mere guess work on my part, but i should say\\nthat mrs. inglethorp picked up the broken cup and placed it on the\\ntable by the bed. feeling in need of a stimulant of some kind, she\\nheated up her cocoa, and drank it off then and there. now we are faced\\nwith a new problem. we know the cocoa contained no strychnine. the\\ncoffee was never drunk. yet the strychnine must have been administered\\nbetween seven and nine o’clock that evening. what third medium was\\nthere—a medium so suitable for disguising the taste of strychnine that\\nit is extraordinary no one has thought of it?” poirot looked round the\\nroom, and then answered himself impressively. “her medicine!”\\n\\n“do you mean that the murderer introduced the strychnine into her\\ntonic?” i cried.\\n\\n“there was no need to introduce it. it was already there—in the\\nmixture. the strychnine that killed mrs. inglethorp was the identical\\nstrychnine prescribed by dr. wilkins. to make that clear to you, i will\\nread you an extract from a book on dispensing which i found in the\\ndispensary of the red cross hospital at tadminster:\\n\\n“‘the following prescription has become famous in text books:\\n\\n\\n          strychninae sulph. . . . . . 1 gr.\\n\\n          potass bromide . . . . . . . 3vi\\n\\n          aqua ad. . . . . . . . . . . . . 3viii\\n\\n          fiat mistura\\n\\n\\n_this solution deposits in a few hours the greater part of the\\nstrychnine salt as an insoluble bromide in transparent crystals. a lady\\nin england lost her life by taking a similar mixture: the precipitated\\nstrychnine collected at the bottom, and in taking the last dose she\\nswallowed nearly all of it!_\\n\\n“now there was, of course, no bromide in dr. wilkins’ prescription, but\\nyou will remember that i mentioned an empty box of bromide powders. one\\nor two of those powders introduced into the full bottle of medicine\\nwould effectually precipitate the strychnine, as the book describes,\\nand cause it to be taken in the last dose. you will learn later that\\nthe person who usually poured out mrs. inglethorp’s medicine was always\\nextremely careful not to shake the bottle, but to leave the sediment at\\nthe bottom of it undisturbed.\\n\\n“throughout the case, there have been evidences that the tragedy was\\nintended to take place on monday evening. on that day, mrs.\\ninglethorp’s bell wire was neatly cut, and on monday evening\\nmademoiselle cynthia was spending the night with friends, so that mrs.\\ninglethorp would have been quite alone in the right wing, completely\\nshut off from help of any kind, and would have died, in all\\nprobability, before medical aid could have been summoned. but in her\\nhurry to be in time for the village entertainment mrs. inglethorp\\nforgot to take her medicine, and the next day she lunched away from\\nhome, so that the last—and fatal—dose was actually taken twenty-four\\nhours later than had been anticipated by the murderer; and it is owing\\nto that delay that the final proof—the last link of the chain—is now in\\nmy hands.”\\n\\namid breathless excitement, he held out three thin strips of paper.\\n\\n“a letter in the murderer’s own hand-writing, _mes amis!_ had it been a\\nlittle clearer in its terms, it is possible that mrs. inglethorp,\\nwarned in time, would have escaped. as it was, she realized her danger,\\nbut not the manner of it.”\\n\\nin the deathly silence, poirot pieced together the slips of paper and,\\nclearing his throat, read:\\n\\ndearest evelyn:\\n\\n    ‘you will be anxious at hearing nothing. it is all right—only it\\n    will be to-night instead of last night. you understand. there’s a\\n    good time coming once the old woman is dead and out of the way. no\\n    one can possibly bring home the crime to me. that idea of yours\\n    about the bromides was a stroke of genius! but we must be very\\n    circumspect. a false step——’\\n\\n\\n“here, my friends, the letter breaks off. doubtless the writer was\\ninterrupted; but there can be no question as to his identity. we all\\nknow this hand-writing and——”\\n\\na howl that was almost a scream broke the silence.\\n\\n“you devil! how did you get it?”\\n\\na chair was overturned. poirot skipped nimbly aside. a quick movement\\non his part, and his assailant fell with a crash.\\n\\n“_messieurs, mesdames_,” said poirot, with a flourish, “let me\\nintroduce you to the murderer, mr. alfred inglethorp!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xiii.\\npoirot explains\\n\\n\\n“poirot, you old villain,” i said, “i’ve half a mind to strangle you!\\nwhat do you mean by deceiving me as you have done?”\\n\\nwe were sitting in the library. several hectic days lay behind us. in\\nthe room below, john and mary were together once more, while alfred\\ninglethorp and miss howard were in custody. now at last, i had poirot\\nto myself, and could relieve my still burning curiosity.\\n\\npoirot did not answer me for a moment, but at last he said:\\n\\n“i did not deceive you, _mon ami_. at most, i permitted you to deceive\\nyourself.”\\n\\n“yes, but why?”\\n\\n“well, it is difficult to explain. you see, my friend, you have a\\nnature so honest, and a countenance so transparent, that—_enfin_, to\\nconceal your feelings is impossible! if i had told you my ideas, the\\nvery first time you saw mr. alfred inglethorp that astute gentleman\\nwould have—in your so expressive idiom—‘smelt a rat’! and then,\\n_bonjour_ to our chances of catching him!”\\n\\n“i think that i have more diplomacy than you give me credit for.”\\n\\n“my friend,” besought poirot, “i implore you, do not enrage yourself!\\nyour help has been of the most invaluable. it is but the extremely\\nbeautiful nature that you have, which made me pause.”\\n\\n“well,” i grumbled, a little mollified. “i still think you might have\\ngiven me a hint.”\\n\\n“but i did, my friend. several hints. you would not take them. think\\nnow, did i ever say to you that i believed john cavendish guilty? did i\\nnot, on the contrary, tell you that he would almost certainly be\\nacquitted?”\\n\\n“yes, but——”\\n\\n“and did i not immediately afterwards speak of the difficulty of\\nbringing the murderer to justice? was it not plain to you that i was\\nspeaking of two entirely different persons?”\\n\\n“no,” i said, “it was not plain to me!”\\n\\n“then again,” continued poirot, “at the beginning, did i not repeat to\\nyou several times that i didn’t want mr. inglethorp arrested _now_?\\nthat should have conveyed something to you.”\\n\\n“do you mean to say you suspected him as long ago as that?”\\n\\n“yes. to begin with, whoever else might benefit by mrs. inglethorp’s\\ndeath, her husband would benefit the most. there was no getting away\\nfrom that. when i went up to styles with you that first day, i had no\\nidea as to how the crime had been committed, but from what i knew of\\nmr. inglethorp i fancied that it would be very hard to find anything to\\nconnect him with it. when i arrived at the château, i realized at once\\nthat it was mrs. inglethorp who had burnt the will; and there, by the\\nway, you cannot complain, my friend, for i tried my best to force on\\nyou the significance of that bedroom fire in midsummer.”\\n\\n“yes, yes,” i said impatiently. “go on.”\\n\\n“well, my friend, as i say, my views as to mr. inglethorp’s guilt were\\nvery much shaken. there was, in fact, so much evidence against him that\\ni was inclined to believe that he had not done it.”\\n\\n“when did you change your mind?”\\n\\n“when i found that the more efforts i made to clear him, the more\\nefforts he made to get himself arrested. then, when i discovered that\\ninglethorp had nothing to do with mrs. raikes and that in fact it was\\njohn cavendish who was interested in that quarter, i was quite sure.”\\n\\n“but why?”\\n\\n“simply this. if it had been inglethorp who was carrying on an intrigue\\nwith mrs. raikes, his silence was perfectly comprehensible. but, when i\\ndiscovered that it was known all over the village that it was john who\\nwas attracted by the farmer’s pretty wife, his silence bore quite a\\ndifferent interpretation. it was nonsense to pretend that he was afraid\\nof the scandal, as no possible scandal could attach to him. this\\nattitude of his gave me furiously to think, and i was slowly forced to\\nthe conclusion that alfred inglethorp wanted to be arrested. _eh bien!_\\nfrom that moment, i was equally determined that he should not be\\narrested.”\\n\\n“wait a minute. i don’t see why he wished to be arrested?”\\n\\n“because, _mon ami_, it is the law of your country that a man once\\nacquitted can never be tried again for the same offence. aha! but it\\nwas clever—his idea! assuredly, he is a man of method. see here, he\\nknew that in his position he was bound to be suspected, so he conceived\\nthe exceedingly clever idea of preparing a lot of manufactured evidence\\nagainst himself. he wished to be arrested. he would then produce his\\nirreproachable alibi—and, hey presto, he was safe for life!”\\n\\n“but i still don’t see how he managed to prove his alibi, and yet go to\\nthe chemist’s shop?”\\n\\npoirot stared at me in surprise.\\n\\n“is it possible? my poor friend! you have not yet realized that it was\\nmiss howard who went to the chemist’s shop?”\\n\\n“miss howard?”\\n\\n“but, certainly. who else? it was most easy for her. she is of a good\\nheight, her voice is deep and manly; moreover, remember, she and\\ninglethorp are cousins, and there is a distinct resemblance between\\nthem, especially in their gait and bearing. it was simplicity itself.\\nthey are a clever pair!”\\n\\n“i am still a little fogged as to how exactly the bromide business was\\ndone,” i remarked.\\n\\n“_bon!_ i will reconstruct for you as far as possible. i am inclined to\\nthink that miss howard was the master mind in that affair. you remember\\nher once mentioning that her father was a doctor? possibly she\\ndispensed his medicines for him, or she may have taken the idea from\\none of the many books lying about when mademoiselle cynthia was\\nstudying for her exam. anyway, she was familiar with the fact that the\\naddition of a bromide to a mixture containing strychnine would cause\\nthe precipitation of the latter. probably the idea came to her quite\\nsuddenly. mrs. inglethorp had a box of bromide powders, which she\\noccasionally took at night. what could be easier than quietly to\\ndissolve one or more of those powders in mrs. inglethorp’s large sized\\nbottle of medicine when it came from coot’s? the risk is practically\\nnil. the tragedy will not take place until nearly a fortnight later. if\\nanyone has seen either of them touching the medicine, they will have\\nforgotten it by that time. miss howard will have engineered her\\nquarrel, and departed from the house. the lapse of time, and her\\nabsence, will defeat all suspicion. yes, it was a clever idea! if they\\nhad left it alone, it is possible the crime might never have been\\nbrought home to them. but they were not satisfied. they tried to be too\\nclever—and that was their undoing.”\\n\\npoirot puffed at his tiny cigarette, his eyes fixed on the ceiling.\\n\\n“they arranged a plan to throw suspicion on john cavendish, by buying\\nstrychnine at the village chemist’s, and signing the register in his\\nhand-writing.\\n\\n“on monday mrs. inglethorp will take the last dose of her medicine. on\\nmonday, therefore, at six o’clock, alfred inglethorp arranges to be\\nseen by a number of people at a spot far removed from the village. miss\\nhoward has previously made up a cock and bull story about him and mrs.\\nraikes to account for his holding his tongue afterwards. at six\\no’clock, miss howard, disguised as alfred inglethorp, enters the\\nchemist’s shop, with her story about a dog, obtains the strychnine, and\\nwrites the name of alfred inglethorp in john’s handwriting, which she\\nhad previously studied carefully.\\n\\n“but, as it will never do if john, too, can prove an alibi, she writes\\nhim an anonymous note—still copying his hand-writing—which takes him to\\na remote spot where it is exceedingly unlikely that anyone will see\\nhim.\\n\\n“so far, all goes well. miss howard goes back to middlingham. alfred\\ninglethorp returns to styles. there is nothing that can compromise him\\nin any way, since it is miss howard who has the strychnine, which,\\nafter all, is only wanted as a blind to throw suspicion on john\\ncavendish.\\n\\n“but now a hitch occurs. mrs. inglethorp does not take her medicine\\nthat night. the broken bell, cynthia’s absence—arranged by inglethorp\\nthrough his wife—all these are wasted. and then—he makes his slip.\\n\\n“mrs. inglethorp is out, and he sits down to write to his accomplice,\\nwho, he fears, may be in a panic at the non-success of their plan. it\\nis probable that mrs. inglethorp returned earlier than he expected.\\ncaught in the act, and somewhat flurried he hastily shuts and locks his\\ndesk. he fears that if he remains in the room he may have to open it\\nagain, and that mrs. inglethorp might catch sight of the letter before\\nhe could snatch it up. so he goes out and walks in the woods, little\\ndreaming that mrs. inglethorp will open his desk, and discover the\\nincriminating document.\\n\\n“but this, as we know, is what happened. mrs. inglethorp reads it, and\\nbecomes aware of the perfidy of her husband and evelyn howard, though,\\nunfortunately, the sentence about the bromides conveys no warning to\\nher mind. she knows that she is in danger—but is ignorant of where the\\ndanger lies. she decides to say nothing to her husband, but sits down\\nand writes to her solicitor, asking him to come on the morrow, and she\\nalso determines to destroy immediately the will which she has just\\nmade. she keeps the fatal letter.”\\n\\n“it was to discover that letter, then, that her husband forced the lock\\nof the despatch-case?”\\n\\n“yes, and from the enormous risk he ran we can see how fully he\\nrealized its importance. that letter excepted, there was absolutely\\nnothing to connect him with the crime.”\\n\\n“there’s only one thing i can’t make out, why didn’t he destroy it at\\nonce when he got hold of it?”\\n\\n“because he did not dare take the biggest risk of all—that of keeping\\nit on his own person.”\\n\\n“i don’t understand.”\\n\\n“look at it from his point of view. i have discovered that there were\\nonly five short minutes in which he could have taken it—the five\\nminutes immediately before our own arrival on the scene, for before\\nthat time annie was brushing the stairs, and would have seen anyone who\\npassed going to the right wing. figure to yourself the scene! he enters\\nthe room, unlocking the door by means of one of the other doorkeys—they\\nwere all much alike. he hurries to the despatch-case—it is locked, and\\nthe keys are nowhere to be seen. that is a terrible blow to him, for it\\nmeans that his presence in the room cannot be concealed as he had\\nhoped. but he sees clearly that everything must be risked for the sake\\nof that damning piece of evidence. quickly, he forces the lock with a\\npenknife, and turns over the papers until he finds what he is looking\\nfor.\\n\\n“but now a fresh dilemma arises: he dare not keep that piece of paper\\non him. he may be seen leaving the room—he may be searched. if the\\npaper is found on him, it is certain doom. probably, at this minute,\\ntoo, he hears the sounds below of mr. wells and john leaving the\\nboudoir. he must act quickly. where can he hide this terrible slip of\\npaper? the contents of the waste-paper-basket are kept and in any case,\\nare sure to be examined. there are no means of destroying it; and he\\ndare not keep it. he looks round, and he sees—what do you think, _mon\\nami?_”\\n\\ni shook my head.\\n\\n“in a moment, he has torn the letter into long thin strips, and rolling\\nthem up into spills he thrusts them hurriedly in amongst the other\\nspills in the vase on the mantle-piece.”\\n\\ni uttered an exclamation.\\n\\n“no one would think of looking there,” poirot continued. “and he will\\nbe able, at his leisure, to come back and destroy this solitary piece\\nof evidence against him.”\\n\\n“then, all the time, it was in the spill vase in mrs. inglethorp’s\\nbedroom, under our very noses?” i cried.\\n\\npoirot nodded.\\n\\n“yes, my friend. that is where i discovered my ‘last link,’ and i owe\\nthat very fortunate discovery to you.”\\n\\n“to me?”\\n\\n“yes. do you remember telling me that my hand shook as i was\\nstraightening the ornaments on the mantelpiece?”\\n\\n“yes, but i don’t see——”\\n\\n“no, but i saw. do you know, my friend, i remembered that earlier in\\nthe morning, when we had been there together, i had straightened all\\nthe objects on the mantelpiece. and, if they were already straightened,\\nthere would be no need to straighten them again, unless, in the\\nmeantime, someone else had touched them.”\\n\\n“dear me,” i murmured, “so that is the explanation of your\\nextraordinary behaviour. you rushed down to styles, and found it still\\nthere?”\\n\\n“yes, and it was a race for time.”\\n\\n“but i still can’t understand why inglethorp was such a fool as to\\nleave it there when he had plenty of opportunity to destroy it.”\\n\\n“ah, but he had no opportunity. _i_ saw to that.”\\n\\n“you?”\\n\\n“yes. do you remember reproving me for taking the household into my\\nconfidence on the subject?”\\n\\n“yes.”\\n\\n“well, my friend, i saw there was just one chance. i was not sure then\\nif inglethorp was the criminal or not, but if he was i reasoned that he\\nwould not have the paper on him, but would have hidden it somewhere,\\nand by enlisting the sympathy of the household i could effectually\\nprevent his destroying it. he was already under suspicion, and by\\nmaking the matter public i secured the services of about ten amateur\\ndetectives, who would be watching him unceasingly, and being himself\\naware of their watchfulness he would not dare seek further to destroy\\nthe document. he was therefore forced to depart from the house, leaving\\nit in the spill vase.”\\n\\n“but surely miss howard had ample opportunities of aiding him.”\\n\\n“yes, but miss howard did not know of the paper’s existence. in\\naccordance with their prearranged plan, she never spoke to alfred\\ninglethorp. they were supposed to be deadly enemies, and until john\\ncavendish was safely convicted they neither of them dared risk a\\nmeeting. of course i had a watch kept on mr. inglethorp, hoping that\\nsooner or later he would lead me to the hiding-place. but he was too\\nclever to take any chances. the paper was safe where it was; since no\\none had thought of looking there in the first week, it was not likely\\nthey would do so afterwards. but for your lucky remark, we might never\\nhave been able to bring him to justice.”\\n\\n“i understand that now; but when did you first begin to suspect miss\\nhoward?”\\n\\n“when i discovered that she had told a lie at the inquest about the\\nletter she had received from mrs. inglethorp.”\\n\\n“why, what was there to lie about?”\\n\\n“you saw that letter? do you recall its general appearance?”\\n\\n“yes—more or less.”\\n\\n“you will recollect, then, that mrs. inglethorp wrote a very\\ndistinctive hand, and left large clear spaces between her words. but if\\nyou look at the date at the top of the letter you will notice that\\n‘july 17th’ is quite different in this respect. do you see what i\\nmean?”\\n\\n“no,” i confessed, “i don’t.”\\n\\n“you do not see that that letter was not written on the 17th, but on\\nthe 7th—the day after miss howard’s departure? the ‘1’ was written in\\nbefore the ‘7’ to turn it into the ‘17th’.”\\n\\n“but why?”\\n\\n“that is exactly what i asked myself. why does miss howard suppress the\\nletter written on the 17th, and produce this faked one instead? because\\nshe did not wish to show the letter of the 17th. why, again? and at\\nonce a suspicion dawned in my mind. you will remember my saying that it\\nwas wise to beware of people who were not telling you the truth.”\\n\\n“and yet,” i cried indignantly, “after that, you gave me two reasons\\nwhy miss howard could not have committed the crime!”\\n\\n“and very good reasons too,” replied poirot. “for a long time they were\\na stumbling-block to me until i remembered a very significant fact:\\nthat she and alfred inglethorp were cousins. she could not have\\ncommitted the crime single-handed, but the reasons against that did not\\ndebar her from being an accomplice. and, then, there was that rather\\nover-vehement hatred of hers! it concealed a very opposite emotion.\\nthere was, undoubtedly, a tie of passion between them long before he\\ncame to styles. they had already arranged their infamous plot—that he\\nshould marry this rich, but rather foolish old lady, induce her to make\\na will leaving her money to him, and then gain their ends by a very\\ncleverly conceived crime. if all had gone as they planned, they would\\nprobably have left england, and lived together on their poor victim’s\\nmoney.\\n\\n“they are a very astute and unscrupulous pair. while suspicion was to\\nbe directed against him, she would be making quiet preparations for a\\nvery different _dénouement_. she arrives from middlingham with all the\\ncompromising items in her possession. no suspicion attaches to her. no\\nnotice is paid to her coming and going in the house. she hides the\\nstrychnine and glasses in john’s room. she puts the beard in the attic.\\nshe will see to it that sooner or later they are duly discovered.”\\n\\n“i don’t quite see why they tried to fix the blame on john,” i\\nremarked. “it would have been much easier for them to bring the crime\\nhome to lawrence.”\\n\\n“yes, but that was mere chance. all the evidence against him arose out\\nof pure accident. it must, in fact, have been distinctly annoying to\\nthe pair of schemers.”\\n\\n“his manner was unfortunate,” i observed thoughtfully.\\n\\n“yes. you realize, of course, what was at the back of that?”\\n\\n“no.”\\n\\n“you did not understand that he believed mademoiselle cynthia guilty of\\nthe crime?”\\n\\n“no,” i exclaimed, astonished. “impossible!”\\n\\n“not at all. i myself nearly had the same idea. it was in my mind when\\ni asked mr. wells that first question about the will. then there were\\nthe bromide powders which she had made up, and her clever male\\nimpersonations, as dorcas recounted them to us. there was really more\\nevidence against her than anyone else.”\\n\\n“you are joking, poirot!”\\n\\n“no. shall i tell you what made monsieur lawrence turn so pale when he\\nfirst entered his mother’s room on the fatal night? it was because,\\nwhilst his mother lay there, obviously poisoned, he saw, over your\\nshoulder, that the door into mademoiselle cynthia’s room was unbolted.”\\n\\n“but he declared that he saw it bolted!” i cried.\\n\\n“exactly,” said poirot dryly. “and that was just what confirmed my\\nsuspicion that it was not. he was shielding mademoiselle cynthia.”\\n\\n“but why should he shield her?”\\n\\n“because he is in love with her.”\\n\\ni laughed.\\n\\n“there, poirot, you are quite wrong! i happen to know for a fact that,\\nfar from being in love with her, he positively dislikes her.”\\n\\n“who told you that, _mon ami?_”\\n\\n“cynthia herself.”\\n\\n“_la pauvre petite!_ and she was concerned?”\\n\\n“she said that she did not mind at all.”\\n\\n“then she certainly did mind very much,” remarked poirot. “they are\\nlike that—_les femmes!_”\\n\\n“what you say about lawrence is a great surprise to me,” i said.\\n\\n“but why? it was most obvious. did not monsieur lawrence make the sour\\nface every time mademoiselle cynthia spoke and laughed with his\\nbrother? he had taken it into his long head that mademoiselle cynthia\\nwas in love with monsieur john. when he entered his mother’s room, and\\nsaw her obviously poisoned, he jumped to the conclusion that\\nmademoiselle cynthia knew something about the matter. he was nearly\\ndriven desperate. first he crushed the coffee-cup to powder under his\\nfeet, remembering that _she_ had gone up with his mother the night\\nbefore, and he determined that there should be no chance of testing its\\ncontents. thenceforward, he strenuously, and quite uselessly, upheld\\nthe theory of ‘death from natural causes’.”\\n\\n“and what about the ‘extra coffee-cup’?”\\n\\n“i was fairly certain that it was mrs. cavendish who had hidden it, but\\ni had to make sure. monsieur lawrence did not know at all what i meant;\\nbut, on reflection, he came to the conclusion that if he could find an\\nextra coffee-cup anywhere his lady love would be cleared of suspicion.\\nand he was perfectly right.”\\n\\n“one thing more. what did mrs. inglethorp mean by her dying words?”\\n\\n“they were, of course, an accusation against her husband.”\\n\\n“dear me, poirot,” i said with a sigh, “i think you have explained\\neverything. i am glad it has all ended so happily. even john and his\\nwife are reconciled.”\\n\\n“thanks to me.”\\n\\n“how do you mean—thanks to you?”\\n\\n“my dear friend, do you not realize that it was simply and solely the\\ntrial which has brought them together again? that john cavendish still\\nloved his wife, i was convinced. also, that she was equally in love\\nwith him. but they had drifted very far apart. it all arose from a\\nmisunderstanding. she married him without love. he knew it. he is a\\nsensitive man in his way, he would not force himself upon her if she\\ndid not want him. and, as he withdrew, her love awoke. but they are\\nboth unusually proud, and their pride held them inexorably apart. he\\ndrifted into an entanglement with mrs. raikes, and she deliberately\\ncultivated the friendship of dr. bauerstein. do you remember the day of\\njohn cavendish’s arrest, when you found me deliberating over a big\\ndecision?”\\n\\n“yes, i quite understood your distress.”\\n\\n“pardon me, _mon ami_, but you did not understand it in the least. i\\nwas trying to decide whether or not i would clear john cavendish at\\nonce. i could have cleared him—though it might have meant a failure to\\nconvict the real criminals. they were entirely in the dark as to my\\nreal attitude up to the very last moment—which partly accounts for my\\nsuccess.”\\n\\n“do you mean that you could have saved john cavendish from being\\nbrought to trial?”\\n\\n“yes, my friend. but i eventually decided in favour of ‘a woman’s\\nhappiness’. nothing but the great danger through which they have passed\\ncould have brought these two proud souls together again.”\\n\\ni looked at poirot in silent amazement. the colossal cheek of the\\nlittle man! who on earth but poirot would have thought of a trial for\\nmurder as a restorer of conjugal happiness!\\n\\n“i perceive your thoughts, _mon ami_,” said poirot, smiling at me. “no\\none but hercule poirot would have attempted such a thing! and you are\\nwrong in condemning it. the happiness of one man and one woman is the\\ngreatest thing in all the world.”\\n\\nhis words took me back to earlier events. i remembered mary as she lay\\nwhite and exhausted on the sofa, listening, listening. there had come\\nthe sound of the bell below. she had started up. poirot had opened the\\ndoor, and meeting her agonized eyes had nodded gently. “yes, madame,”\\nhe said. “i have brought him back to you.” he had stood aside, and as i\\nwent out i had seen the look in mary’s eyes, as john cavendish had\\ncaught his wife in his arms.\\n\\n“perhaps you are right, poirot,” i said gently. “yes, it is the\\ngreatest thing in the world.”\\n\\nsuddenly, there was a tap at the door, and cynthia peeped in.\\n\\n“i—i only——”\\n\\n“come in,” i said, springing up.\\n\\nshe came in, but did not sit down.\\n\\n“i—only wanted to tell you something——”\\n\\n“yes?”\\n\\ncynthia fidgeted with a little tassel for some moments, then, suddenly\\nexclaiming: “you dears!” kissed first me and then poirot, and rushed\\nout of the room again.\\n\\n“what on earth does this mean?” i asked, surprised.\\n\\nit was very nice to be kissed by cynthia, but the publicity of the\\nsalute rather impaired the pleasure.\\n\\n“it means that she has discovered monsieur lawrence does not dislike\\nher as much as she thought,” replied poirot philosophically.\\n\\n“but——”\\n\\n“here he is.”\\n\\nlawrence at that moment passed the door.\\n\\n“eh! monsieur lawrence,” called poirot. “we must congratulate you, is\\nit not so?”\\n\\nlawrence blushed, and then smiled awkwardly. a man in love is a sorry\\nspectacle. now cynthia had looked charming.\\n\\ni sighed.\\n\\n“what is it, _mon ami?_”\\n\\n“nothing,” i said sadly. “they are two delightful women!”\\n\\n“and neither of them is for you?” finished poirot. “never mind. console\\nyourself, my friend. we may hunt together again, who knows? and then——”\\n\\n\\nthe end\\n')"

POIROT EXPLAINS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER I.\\nI GO TO STYLES\\n\\n\\nThe intense interest aroused in the public by what was known at the\\ntime as “The Styles Case” has now somewhat subsided. Nevertheless, in\\nview of the world-wide notoriety which attended it, I have been asked,\\nboth by my friend Poirot and the family themselves, to write an account\\nof the whole story. This, we trust, will effectually silence the\\nsensational rumours which still persist.\\n\\nI will therefore briefly set down the circumstances which led to my\\nbeing connected with the affair.\\n\\nI had been invalided home from the Front; and, after spending some\\nmonths in a rather depressing Convalescent Home, was given a month’s\\nsick leave. Having no near relations or friends, I was trying to make\\nup my mind what to do, when I ran across John Cavendish. I had seen\\nvery little of him for some years. Indeed, I had never known him\\nparticularly well. He was a good fifteen years my senior, for one\\nthing, though he hardly looked his forty-five years. As a boy, though,\\nI had often stayed at Styles, his mother’s place in Essex.\\n\\nWe had a good yarn about old times, and it ended in his inviting me\\ndown to Styles to spend my leave there.\\n\\n“The mater will be delighted to see you again—after all those years,”\\nhe added.\\n\\n“Your mother keeps well?” I asked.\\n\\n“Oh, yes. I suppose you know that she has married again?”\\n\\nI am afraid I showed my surprise rather plainly. Mrs. Cavendish, who\\nhad married John’s father when he was a widower with two sons, had been\\na handsome woman of middle-age as I remembered her. She certainly could\\nnot be a day less than seventy now. I recalled her as an energetic,\\nautocratic personality, somewhat inclined to charitable and social\\nnotoriety, with a fondness for opening bazaars and playing the Lady\\nBountiful. She was a most generous woman, and possessed a considerable\\nfortune of her own.\\n\\nTheir country-place, Styles Court, had been purchased by Mr. Cavendish\\nearly in their married life. He had been completely under his wife’s\\nascendancy, so much so that, on dying, he left the place to her for her\\nlifetime, as well as the larger part of his income; an arrangement that\\nwas distinctly unfair to his two sons. Their step-mother, however, had\\nalways been most generous to them; indeed, they were so young at the\\ntime of their father’s remarriage that they always thought of her as\\ntheir own mother.\\n\\nLawrence, the younger, had been a delicate youth. He had qualified as a\\ndoctor but early relinquished the profession of medicine, and lived at\\nhome while pursuing literary ambitions; though his verses never had any\\nmarked success.\\n\\nJohn practised for some time as a barrister, but had finally settled\\ndown to the more congenial life of a country squire. He had married two\\nyears ago, and had taken his wife to live at Styles, though I\\nentertained a shrewd suspicion that he would have preferred his mother\\nto increase his allowance, which would have enabled him to have a home\\nof his own. Mrs. Cavendish, however, was a lady who liked to make her\\nown plans, and expected other people to fall in with them, and in this\\ncase she certainly had the whip hand, namely: the purse strings.\\n\\nJohn noticed my surprise at the news of his mother’s remarriage and\\nsmiled rather ruefully.\\n\\n“Rotten little bounder too!” he said savagely. “I can tell you,\\nHastings, it’s making life jolly difficult for us. As for Evie—you\\nremember Evie?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“Oh, I suppose she was after your time. She’s the mater’s factotum,\\ncompanion, Jack of all trades! A great sport—old Evie! Not precisely\\nyoung and beautiful, but as game as they make them.”\\n\\n“You were going to say——?”\\n\\n“Oh, this fellow! He turned up from nowhere, on the pretext of being a\\nsecond cousin or something of Evie’s, though she didn’t seem\\nparticularly keen to acknowledge the relationship. The fellow is an\\nabsolute outsider, anyone can see that. He’s got a great black beard,\\nand wears patent leather boots in all weathers! But the mater cottoned\\nto him at once, took him on as secretary—you know how she’s always\\nrunning a hundred societies?”\\n\\nI nodded.\\n\\n“Well, of course the war has turned the hundreds into thousands. No\\ndoubt the fellow was very useful to her. But you could have knocked us\\nall down with a feather when, three months ago, she suddenly announced\\nthat she and Alfred were engaged! The fellow must be at least twenty\\nyears younger than she is! It’s simply bare-faced fortune hunting; but\\nthere you are—she is her own mistress, and she’s married him.”\\n\\n“It must be a difficult situation for you all.”\\n\\n“Difficult! It’s damnable!”\\n\\nThus it came about that, three days later, I descended from the train\\nat Styles St. Mary, an absurd little station, with no apparent reason\\nfor existence, perched up in the midst of green fields and country\\nlanes. John Cavendish was waiting on the platform, and piloted me out\\nto the car.\\n\\n“Got a drop or two of petrol still, you see,” he remarked. “Mainly\\nowing to the mater’s activities.”\\n\\nThe village of Styles St. Mary was situated about two miles from the\\nlittle station, and Styles Court lay a mile the other side of it. It\\nwas a still, warm day in early July. As one looked out over the flat\\nEssex country, lying so green and peaceful under the afternoon sun, it\\nseemed almost impossible to believe that, not so very far away, a great\\nwar was running its appointed course. I felt I had suddenly strayed\\ninto another world. As we turned in at the lodge gates, John said:\\n\\n“I’m afraid you’ll find it very quiet down here, Hastings.”\\n\\n“My dear fellow, that’s just what I want.”\\n\\n“Oh, it’s pleasant enough if you want to lead the idle life. I drill\\nwith the volunteers twice a week, and lend a hand at the farms. My wife\\nworks regularly ‘on the land’. She is up at five every morning to milk,\\nand keeps at it steadily until lunchtime. It’s a jolly good life taking\\nit all round—if it weren’t for that fellow Alfred Inglethorp!” He\\nchecked the car suddenly, and glanced at his watch. “I wonder if we’ve\\ntime to pick up Cynthia. No, she’ll have started from the hospital by\\nnow.”\\n\\n“Cynthia! That’s not your wife?”\\n\\n“No, Cynthia is a protégée of my mother’s, the daughter of an old\\nschoolfellow of hers, who married a rascally solicitor. He came a\\ncropper, and the girl was left an orphan and penniless. My mother came\\nto the rescue, and Cynthia has been with us nearly two years now. She\\nworks in the Red Cross Hospital at Tadminster, seven miles away.”\\n\\nAs he spoke the last words, we drew up in front of the fine old house.\\nA lady in a stout tweed skirt, who was bending over a flower bed,\\nstraightened herself at our approach.\\n\\n“Hullo, Evie, here’s our wounded hero! Mr. Hastings—Miss Howard.”\\n\\nMiss Howard shook hands with a hearty, almost painful, grip. I had an\\nimpression of very blue eyes in a sunburnt face. She was a\\npleasant-looking woman of about forty, with a deep voice, almost manly\\nin its stentorian tones, and had a large sensible square body, with\\nfeet to match—these last encased in good thick boots. Her conversation,\\nI soon found, was couched in the telegraphic style.\\n\\n“Weeds grow like house afire. Can’t keep even with ’em. Shall press you\\nin. Better be careful.”\\n\\n“I’m sure I shall be only too delighted to make myself useful,” I\\nresponded.\\n\\n“Don’t say it. Never does. Wish you hadn’t later.”\\n\\n“You’re a cynic, Evie,” said John, laughing. “Where’s tea to-day—inside\\nor out?”\\n\\n“Out. Too fine a day to be cooped up in the house.”\\n\\n“Come on then, you’ve done enough gardening for to-day. ‘The labourer\\nis worthy of his hire’, you know. Come and be refreshed.”\\n\\n“Well,” said Miss Howard, drawing off her gardening gloves, “I’m\\ninclined to agree with you.”\\n\\nShe led the way round the house to where tea was spread under the shade\\nof a large sycamore.\\n\\nA figure rose from one of the basket chairs, and came a few steps to\\nmeet us.\\n\\n“My wife, Hastings,” said John.\\n\\nI shall never forget my first sight of Mary Cavendish. Her tall,\\nslender form, outlined against the bright light; the vivid sense of\\nslumbering fire that seemed to find expression only in those wonderful\\ntawny eyes of hers, remarkable eyes, different from any other woman’s\\nthat I have ever known; the intense power of stillness she possessed,\\nwhich nevertheless conveyed the impression of a wild untamed spirit in\\nan exquisitely civilised body—all these things are burnt into my\\nmemory. I shall never forget them.\\n\\nShe greeted me with a few words of pleasant welcome in a low clear\\nvoice, and I sank into a basket chair feeling distinctly glad that I\\nhad accepted John’s invitation. Mrs. Cavendish gave me some tea, and\\nher few quiet remarks heightened my first impression of her as a\\nthoroughly fascinating woman. An appreciative listener is always\\nstimulating, and I described, in a humorous manner, certain incidents\\nof my Convalescent Home, in a way which, I flatter myself, greatly\\namused my hostess. John, of course, good fellow though he is, could\\nhardly be called a brilliant conversationalist.\\n\\nAt that moment a well remembered voice floated through the open French\\nwindow near at hand:\\n\\n“Then you’ll write to the Princess after tea, Alfred? I’ll write to\\nLady Tadminster for the second day, myself. Or shall we wait until we\\nhear from the Princess? In case of a refusal, Lady Tadminster might\\nopen it the first day, and Mrs. Crosbie the second. Then there’s the\\nDuchess—about the school fête.”\\n\\nThere was the murmur of a man’s voice, and then Mrs. Inglethorp’s rose\\nin reply:\\n\\n“Yes, certainly. After tea will do quite well. You are so thoughtful,\\nAlfred dear.”\\n\\nThe French window swung open a little wider, and a handsome\\nwhite-haired old lady, with a somewhat masterful cast of features,\\nstepped out of it on to the lawn. A man followed her, a suggestion of\\ndeference in his manner.\\n\\nMrs. Inglethorp greeted me with effusion.\\n\\n“Why, if it isn’t too delightful to see you again, Mr. Hastings, after\\nall these years. Alfred, darling, Mr. Hastings—my husband.”\\n\\nI looked with some curiosity at “Alfred darling”. He certainly struck a\\nrather alien note. I did not wonder at John objecting to his beard. It\\nwas one of the longest and blackest I have ever seen. He wore\\ngold-rimmed pince-nez, and had a curious impassivity of feature. It\\nstruck me that he might look natural on a stage, but was strangely out\\nof place in real life. His voice was rather deep and unctuous. He\\nplaced a wooden hand in mine and said:\\n\\n“This is a pleasure, Mr. Hastings.” Then, turning to his wife: “Emily\\ndearest, I think that cushion is a little damp.”\\n\\nShe beamed fondly on him, as he substituted another with every\\ndemonstration of the tenderest care. Strange infatuation of an\\notherwise sensible woman!\\n\\nWith the presence of Mr. Inglethorp, a sense of constraint and veiled\\nhostility seemed to settle down upon the company. Miss Howard, in\\nparticular, took no pains to conceal her feelings. Mrs. Inglethorp,\\nhowever, seemed to notice nothing unusual. Her volubility, which I\\nremembered of old, had lost nothing in the intervening years, and she\\npoured out a steady flood of conversation, mainly on the subject of the\\nforthcoming bazaar which she was organizing and which was to take place\\nshortly. Occasionally she referred to her husband over a question of\\ndays or dates. His watchful and attentive manner never varied. From the\\nvery first I took a firm and rooted dislike to him, and I flatter\\nmyself that my first judgments are usually fairly shrewd.\\n\\nPresently Mrs. Inglethorp turned to give some instructions about\\nletters to Evelyn Howard, and her husband addressed me in his\\npainstaking voice:\\n\\n“Is soldiering your regular profession, Mr. Hastings?”\\n\\n“No, before the war I was in Lloyd’s.”\\n\\n“And you will return there after it is over?”\\n\\n“Perhaps. Either that or a fresh start altogether.”\\n\\nMary Cavendish leant forward.\\n\\n“What would you really choose as a profession, if you could just\\nconsult your inclination?”\\n\\n“Well, that depends.”\\n\\n“No secret hobby?” she asked. “Tell me—you’re drawn to something?\\nEveryone is—usually something absurd.”\\n\\n“You’ll laugh at me.”\\n\\nShe smiled.\\n\\n“Perhaps.”\\n\\n“Well, I’ve always had a secret hankering to be a detective!”\\n\\n“The real thing—Scotland Yard? Or Sherlock Holmes?”\\n\\n“Oh, Sherlock Holmes by all means. But really, seriously, I am awfully\\ndrawn to it. I came across a man in Belgium once, a very famous\\ndetective, and he quite inflamed me. He was a marvellous little fellow.\\nHe used to say that all good detective work was a mere matter of\\nmethod. My system is based on his—though of course I have progressed\\nrather further. He was a funny little man, a great dandy, but\\nwonderfully clever.”\\n\\n“Like a good detective story myself,” remarked Miss Howard. “Lots of\\nnonsense written, though. Criminal discovered in last chapter. Everyone\\ndumbfounded. Real crime—you’d know at once.”\\n\\n“There have been a great number of undiscovered crimes,” I argued.\\n\\n“Don’t mean the police, but the people that are right in it. The\\nfamily. You couldn’t really hoodwink them. They’d know.”\\n\\n“Then,” I said, much amused, “you think that if you were mixed up in a\\ncrime, say a murder, you’d be able to spot the murderer right off?”\\n\\n“Of course I should. Mightn’t be able to prove it to a pack of lawyers.\\nBut I’m certain I’d know. I’d feel it in my fingertips if he came near\\nme.”\\n\\n“It might be a ‘she’,” I suggested.\\n\\n“Might. But murder’s a violent crime. Associate it more with a man.”\\n\\n“Not in a case of poisoning.” Mrs. Cavendish’s clear voice startled me.\\n“Dr. Bauerstein was saying yesterday that, owing to the general\\nignorance of the more uncommon poisons among the medical profession,\\nthere were probably countless cases of poisoning quite unsuspected.”\\n\\n“Why, Mary, what a gruesome conversation!” cried Mrs. Inglethorp. “It\\nmakes me feel as if a goose were walking over my grave. Oh, there’s\\nCynthia!”\\n\\nA young girl in V.A.D. uniform ran lightly across the lawn.\\n\\n“Why, Cynthia, you are late to-day. This is Mr. Hastings—Miss Murdoch.”\\n\\nCynthia Murdoch was a fresh-looking young creature, full of life and\\nvigour. She tossed off her little V.A.D. cap, and I admired the great\\nloose waves of her auburn hair, and the smallness and whiteness of the\\nhand she held out to claim her tea. With dark eyes and eyelashes she\\nwould have been a beauty.\\n\\nShe flung herself down on the ground beside John, and as I handed her a\\nplate of sandwiches she smiled up at me.\\n\\n“Sit down here on the grass, do. It’s ever so much nicer.”\\n\\nI dropped down obediently.\\n\\n“You work at Tadminster, don’t you, Miss Murdoch?”\\n\\nShe nodded.\\n\\n“For my sins.”\\n\\n“Do they bully you, then?” I asked, smiling.\\n\\n“I should like to see them!” cried Cynthia with dignity.\\n\\n“I have got a cousin who is nursing,” I remarked. “And she is terrified\\nof ‘Sisters’.”\\n\\n“I don’t wonder. Sisters _are_, you know, Mr. Hastings. They simp-ly\\n_are_! You’ve no idea! But I’m not a nurse, thank heaven, I work in the\\ndispensary.”\\n\\n“How many people do you poison?” I asked, smiling.\\n\\nCynthia smiled too.\\n\\n“Oh, hundreds!” she said.\\n\\n“Cynthia,” called Mrs. Inglethorp, “do you think you could write a few\\nnotes for me?”\\n\\n“Certainly, Aunt Emily.”\\n\\nShe jumped up promptly, and something in her manner reminded me that\\nher position was a dependent one, and that Mrs. Inglethorp, kind as she\\nmight be in the main, did not allow her to forget it.\\n\\nMy hostess turned to me.\\n\\n“John will show you your room. Supper is at half-past seven. We have\\ngiven up late dinner for some time now. Lady Tadminster, our Member’s\\nwife—she was the late Lord Abbotsbury’s daughter—does the same. She\\nagrees with me that one must set an example of economy. We are quite a\\nwar household; nothing is wasted here—every scrap of waste paper, even,\\nis saved and sent away in sacks.”\\n\\nI expressed my appreciation, and John took me into the house and up the\\nbroad staircase, which forked right and left half-way to different\\nwings of the building. My room was in the left wing, and looked out\\nover the park.\\n\\nJohn left me, and a few minutes later I saw him from my window walking\\nslowly across the grass arm in arm with Cynthia Murdoch. I heard Mrs.\\nInglethorp call “Cynthia” impatiently, and the girl started and ran\\nback to the house. At the same moment, a man stepped out from the\\nshadow of a tree and walked slowly in the same direction. He looked\\nabout forty, very dark with a melancholy clean-shaven face. Some\\nviolent emotion seemed to be mastering him. He looked up at my window\\nas he passed, and I recognized him, though he had changed much in the\\nfifteen years that had elapsed since we last met. It was John’s younger\\nbrother, Lawrence Cavendish. I wondered what it was that had brought\\nthat singular expression to his face.\\n\\nThen I dismissed him from my mind, and returned to the contemplation of\\nmy own affairs.\\n\\nThe evening passed pleasantly enough; and I dreamed that night of that\\nenigmatical woman, Mary Cavendish.\\n\\nThe next morning dawned bright and sunny, and I was full of the\\nanticipation of a delightful visit.\\n\\nI did not see Mrs. Cavendish until lunch-time, when she volunteered to\\ntake me for a walk, and we spent a charming afternoon roaming in the\\nwoods, returning to the house about five.\\n\\nAs we entered the large hall, John beckoned us both into the\\nsmoking-room. I saw at once by his face that something disturbing had\\noccurred. We followed him in, and he shut the door after us.\\n\\n“Look here, Mary, there’s the deuce of a mess. Evie’s had a row with\\nAlfred Inglethorp, and she’s off.”\\n\\n“Evie? Off?”\\n\\nJohn nodded gloomily.\\n\\n“Yes; you see she went to the mater, and—Oh,—here’s Evie herself.”\\n\\nMiss Howard entered. Her lips were set grimly together, and she carried\\na small suit-case. She looked excited and determined, and slightly on\\nthe defensive.\\n\\n“At any rate,” she burst out, “I’ve spoken my mind!”\\n\\n“My dear Evelyn,” cried Mrs. Cavendish, “this can’t be true!”\\n\\nMiss Howard nodded grimly.\\n\\n“True enough! Afraid I said some things to Emily she won’t forget or\\nforgive in a hurry. Don’t mind if they’ve only sunk in a bit. Probably\\nwater off a duck’s back, though. I said right out: ‘You’re an old\\nwoman, Emily, and there’s no fool like an old fool. The man’s twenty\\nyears younger than you, and don’t you fool yourself as to what he\\nmarried you for. Money! Well, don’t let him have too much of it. Farmer\\nRaikes has got a very pretty young wife. Just ask your Alfred how much\\ntime he spends over there.’ She was very angry. Natural! I went on,\\n‘I’m going to warn you, whether you like it or not. That man would as\\nsoon murder you in your bed as look at you. He’s a bad lot. You can say\\nwhat you like to me, but remember what I’ve told you. He’s a bad lot!’”\\n\\n“What did she say?”\\n\\nMiss Howard made an extremely expressive grimace.\\n\\n“‘Darling Alfred’—‘dearest Alfred’—‘wicked calumnies’ —‘wicked\\nlies’—‘wicked woman’—to accuse her ‘dear husband!’ The sooner I left\\nher house the better. So I’m off.”\\n\\n“But not now?”\\n\\n“This minute!”\\n\\nFor a moment we sat and stared at her. Finally John Cavendish, finding\\nhis persuasions of no avail, went off to look up the trains. His wife\\nfollowed him, murmuring something about persuading Mrs. Inglethorp to\\nthink better of it.\\n\\nAs she left the room, Miss Howard’s face changed. She leant towards me\\neagerly.\\n\\n“Mr. Hastings, you’re honest. I can trust you?”\\n\\nI was a little startled. She laid her hand on my arm, and sank her\\nvoice to a whisper.\\n\\n“Look after her, Mr. Hastings. My poor Emily. They’re a lot of\\nsharks—all of them. Oh, I know what I’m talking about. There isn’t one\\nof them that’s not hard up and trying to get money out of her. I’ve\\nprotected her as much as I could. Now I’m out of the way, they’ll\\nimpose upon her.”\\n\\n“Of course, Miss Howard,” I said, “I’ll do everything I can, but I’m\\nsure you’re excited and overwrought.”\\n\\nShe interrupted me by slowly shaking her forefinger.\\n\\n“Young man, trust me. I’ve lived in the world rather longer than you\\nhave. All I ask you is to keep your eyes open. You’ll see what I mean.”\\n\\nThe throb of the motor came through the open window, and Miss Howard\\nrose and moved to the door. John’s voice sounded outside. With her hand\\non the handle, she turned her head over her shoulder, and beckoned to\\nme.\\n\\n“Above all, Mr. Hastings, watch that devil—her husband!”\\n\\nThere was no time for more. Miss Howard was swallowed up in an eager\\nchorus of protests and good-byes. The Inglethorps did not appear.\\n\\nAs the motor drove away, Mrs. Cavendish suddenly detached herself from\\nthe group, and moved across the drive to the lawn to meet a tall\\nbearded man who had been evidently making for the house. The colour\\nrose in her cheeks as she held out her hand to him.\\n\\n“Who is that?” I asked sharply, for instinctively I distrusted the man.\\n\\n“That’s Dr. Bauerstein,” said John shortly.\\n\\n“And who is Dr. Bauerstein?”\\n\\n“He’s staying in the village doing a rest cure, after a bad nervous\\nbreakdown. He’s a London specialist; a very clever man—one of the\\ngreatest living experts on poisons, I believe.”\\n\\n“And he’s a great friend of Mary’s,” put in Cynthia, the irrepressible.\\n\\nJohn Cavendish frowned and changed the subject.\\n\\n“Come for a stroll, Hastings. This has been a most rotten business. She\\nalways had a rough tongue, but there is no stauncher friend in England\\nthan Evelyn Howard.”\\n\\nHe took the path through the plantation, and we walked down to the\\nvillage through the woods which bordered one side of the estate.\\n\\nAs we passed through one of the gates on our way home again, a pretty\\nyoung woman of gipsy type coming in the opposite direction bowed and\\nsmiled.\\n\\n“That’s a pretty girl,” I remarked appreciatively.\\n\\nJohn’s face hardened.\\n\\n“That is Mrs. Raikes.”\\n\\n“The one that Miss Howard——”\\n\\n“Exactly,” said John, with rather unnecessary abruptness.\\n\\nI thought of the white-haired old lady in the big house, and that vivid\\nwicked little face that had just smiled into ours, and a vague chill of\\nforeboding crept over me. I brushed it aside.\\n\\n“Styles is really a glorious old place,” I said to John.\\n\\nHe nodded rather gloomily.\\n\\n“Yes, it’s a fine property. It’ll be mine some day—should be mine now\\nby rights, if my father had only made a decent will. And then I\\nshouldn’t be so damned hard up as I am now.”\\n\\n“Hard up, are you?”\\n\\n“My dear Hastings, I don’t mind telling you that I’m at my wits’ end\\nfor money.”\\n\\n“Couldn’t your brother help you?”\\n\\n“Lawrence? He’s gone through every penny he ever had, publishing rotten\\nverses in fancy bindings. No, we’re an impecunious lot. My mother’s\\nalways been awfully good to us, I must say. That is, up to now. Since\\nher marriage, of course——” he broke off, frowning.\\n\\nFor the first time I felt that, with Evelyn Howard, something\\nindefinable had gone from the atmosphere. Her presence had spelt\\nsecurity. Now that security was removed—and the air seemed rife with\\nsuspicion. The sinister face of Dr. Bauerstein recurred to me\\nunpleasantly. A vague suspicion of everyone and everything filled my\\nmind. Just for a moment I had a premonition of approaching evil.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II.\\nTHE 16TH AND 17TH OF JULY\\n\\n\\nI had arrived at Styles on the 5th of July. I come now to the events of\\nthe 16th and 17th of that month. For the convenience of the reader I\\nwill recapitulate the incidents of those days in as exact a manner as\\npossible. They were elicited subsequently at the trial by a process of\\nlong and tedious cross-examinations.\\n\\nI received a letter from Evelyn Howard a couple of days after her\\ndeparture, telling me she was working as a nurse at the big hospital in\\nMiddlingham, a manufacturing town some fifteen miles away, and begging\\nme to let her know if Mrs. Inglethorp should show any wish to be\\nreconciled.\\n\\nThe only fly in the ointment of my peaceful days was Mrs. Cavendish’s\\nextraordinary, and, for my part, unaccountable preference for the\\nsociety of Dr. Bauerstein. What she saw in the man I cannot imagine,\\nbut she was always asking him up to the house, and often went off for\\nlong expeditions with him. I must confess that I was quite unable to\\nsee his attraction.\\n\\nThe 16th of July fell on a Monday. It was a day of turmoil. The famous\\nbazaar had taken place on Saturday, and an entertainment, in connection\\nwith the same charity, at which Mrs. Inglethorp was to recite a War\\npoem, was to be held that night. We were all busy during the morning\\narranging and decorating the Hall in the village where it was to take\\nplace. We had a late luncheon and spent the afternoon resting in the\\ngarden. I noticed that John’s manner was somewhat unusual. He seemed\\nvery excited and restless.\\n\\nAfter tea, Mrs. Inglethorp went to lie down to rest before her efforts\\nin the evening and I challenged Mary Cavendish to a single at tennis.\\n\\nAbout a quarter to seven, Mrs. Inglethorp called us that we should be\\nlate as supper was early that night. We had rather a scramble to get\\nready in time; and before the meal was over the motor was waiting at\\nthe door.\\n\\nThe entertainment was a great success, Mrs. Inglethorp’s recitation\\nreceiving tremendous applause. There were also some tableaux in which\\nCynthia took part. She did not return with us, having been asked to a\\nsupper party, and to remain the night with some friends who had been\\nacting with her in the tableaux.\\n\\nThe following morning, Mrs. Inglethorp stayed in bed to breakfast, as\\nshe was rather overtired; but she appeared in her briskest mood about\\n12.30, and swept Lawrence and myself off to a luncheon party.\\n\\n“Such a charming invitation from Mrs. Rolleston. Lady Tadminster’s\\nsister, you know. The Rollestons came over with the Conqueror—one of\\nour oldest families.”\\n\\nMary had excused herself on the plea of an engagement with Dr.\\nBauerstein.\\n\\nWe had a pleasant luncheon, and as we drove away Lawrence suggested\\nthat we should return by Tadminster, which was barely a mile out of our\\nway, and pay a visit to Cynthia in her dispensary. Mrs. Inglethorp\\nreplied that this was an excellent idea, but as she had several letters\\nto write she would drop us there, and we could come back with Cynthia\\nin the pony-trap.\\n\\nWe were detained under suspicion by the hospital porter, until Cynthia\\nappeared to vouch for us, looking very cool and sweet in her long white\\noverall. She took us up to her sanctum, and introduced us to her fellow\\ndispenser, a rather awe-inspiring individual, whom Cynthia cheerily\\naddressed as “Nibs.”\\n\\n“What a lot of bottles!” I exclaimed, as my eye travelled round the\\nsmall room. “Do you really know what’s in them all?”\\n\\n“Say something original,” groaned Cynthia. “Every single person who\\ncomes up here says that. We are really thinking of bestowing a prize on\\nthe first individual who does _not_ say: ‘What a lot of bottles!’ And I\\nknow the next thing you’re going to say is: ‘How many people have you\\npoisoned?’”\\n\\nI pleaded guilty with a laugh.\\n\\n“If you people only knew how fatally easy it is to poison someone by\\nmistake, you wouldn’t joke about it. Come on, let’s have tea. We’ve got\\nall sorts of secret stores in that cupboard. No, Lawrence—that’s the\\npoison cupboard. The big cupboard—that’s right.”\\n\\nWe had a very cheery tea, and assisted Cynthia to wash up afterwards.\\nWe had just put away the last tea-spoon when a knock came at the door.\\nThe countenances of Cynthia and Nibs were suddenly petrified into a\\nstern and forbidding expression.\\n\\n“Come in,” said Cynthia, in a sharp professional tone.\\n\\nA young and rather scared looking nurse appeared with a bottle which\\nshe proffered to Nibs, who waved her towards Cynthia with the somewhat\\nenigmatical remark:\\n\\n“_I_’m not really here to-day.”\\n\\nCynthia took the bottle and examined it with the severity of a judge.\\n\\n“This should have been sent up this morning.”\\n\\n“Sister is very sorry. She forgot.”\\n\\n“Sister should read the rules outside the door.”\\n\\nI gathered from the little nurse’s expression that there was not the\\nleast likelihood of her having the hardihood to retail this message to\\nthe dreaded “Sister”.\\n\\n“So now it can’t be done until to-morrow,” finished Cynthia.\\n\\n“Don’t you think you could possibly let us have it to-night?”\\n\\n“Well,” said Cynthia graciously, “we are very busy, but if we have time\\nit shall be done.”\\n\\nThe little nurse withdrew, and Cynthia promptly took a jar from the\\nshelf, refilled the bottle, and placed it on the table outside the\\ndoor.\\n\\nI laughed.\\n\\n“Discipline must be maintained?”\\n\\n“Exactly. Come out on our little balcony. You can see all the outside\\nwards there.”\\n\\nI followed Cynthia and her friend and they pointed out the different\\nwards to me. Lawrence remained behind, but after a few moments Cynthia\\ncalled to him over her shoulder to come and join us. Then she looked at\\nher watch.\\n\\n“Nothing more to do, Nibs?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“All right. Then we can lock up and go.”\\n\\nI had seen Lawrence in quite a different light that afternoon. Compared\\nto John, he was an astoundingly difficult person to get to know. He was\\nthe opposite of his brother in almost every respect, being unusually\\nshy and reserved. Yet he had a certain charm of manner, and I fancied\\nthat, if one really knew him well, one could have a deep affection for\\nhim. I had always fancied that his manner to Cynthia was rather\\nconstrained, and that she on her side was inclined to be shy of him.\\nBut they were both gay enough this afternoon, and chatted together like\\na couple of children.\\n\\nAs we drove through the village, I remembered that I wanted some\\nstamps, so accordingly we pulled up at the post office.\\n\\nAs I came out again, I cannoned into a little man who was just\\nentering. I drew aside and apologised, when suddenly, with a loud\\nexclamation, he clasped me in his arms and kissed me warmly.\\n\\n“_Mon ami_ Hastings!” he cried. “It is indeed _mon ami_ Hastings!”\\n\\n“Poirot!” I exclaimed.\\n\\nI turned to the pony-trap.\\n\\n“This is a very pleasant meeting for me, Miss Cynthia. This is my old\\nfriend, Monsieur Poirot, whom I have not seen for years.”\\n\\n“Oh, we know Monsieur Poirot,” said Cynthia gaily. “But I had no idea\\nhe was a friend of yours.”\\n\\n“Yes, indeed,” said Poirot seriously. “I know Mademoiselle Cynthia. It\\nis by the charity of that good Mrs. Inglethorp that I am here.” Then,\\nas I looked at him inquiringly: “Yes, my friend, she had kindly\\nextended hospitality to seven of my countrypeople who, alas, are\\nrefugees from their native land. We Belgians will always remember her\\nwith gratitude.”\\n\\nPoirot was an extraordinary looking little man. He was hardly more than\\nfive feet, four inches, but carried himself with great dignity. His\\nhead was exactly the shape of an egg, and he always perched it a little\\non one side. His moustache was very stiff and military. The neatness of\\nhis attire was almost incredible. I believe a speck of dust would have\\ncaused him more pain than a bullet wound. Yet this quaint dandified\\nlittle man who, I was sorry to see, now limped badly, had been in his\\ntime one of the most celebrated members of the Belgian police. As a\\ndetective, his _flair_ had been extraordinary, and he had achieved\\ntriumphs by unravelling some of the most baffling cases of the day.\\n\\nHe pointed out to me the little house inhabited by him and his fellow\\nBelgians, and I promised to go and see him at an early date. Then he\\nraised his hat with a flourish to Cynthia, and we drove away.\\n\\n“He’s a dear little man,” said Cynthia. “I’d no idea you knew him.”\\n\\n“You’ve been entertaining a celebrity unawares,” I replied.\\n\\nAnd, for the rest of the way home, I recited to them the various\\nexploits and triumphs of Hercule Poirot.\\n\\nWe arrived back in a very cheerful mood. As we entered the hall, Mrs.\\nInglethorp came out of her boudoir. She looked flushed and upset.\\n\\n“Oh, it’s you,” she said.\\n\\n“Is there anything the matter, Aunt Emily?” asked Cynthia.\\n\\n“Certainly not,” said Mrs. Inglethorp sharply. “What should there be?”\\nThen catching sight of Dorcas, the parlourmaid, going into the\\ndining-room, she called to her to bring some stamps into the boudoir.\\n\\n“Yes, m’m.” The old servant hesitated, then added diffidently: “Don’t\\nyou think, m’m, you’d better get to bed? You’re looking very tired.”\\n\\n“Perhaps you’re right, Dorcas—yes—no—not now. I’ve some letters I must\\nfinish by post-time. Have you lighted the fire in my room as I told\\nyou?”\\n\\n“Yes, m’m.”\\n\\n“Then I’ll go to bed directly after supper.”\\n\\nShe went into the boudoir again, and Cynthia stared after her.\\n\\n“Goodness gracious! I wonder what’s up?” she said to Lawrence.\\n\\nHe did not seem to have heard her, for without a word he turned on his\\nheel and went out of the house.\\n\\nI suggested a quick game of tennis before supper and, Cynthia agreeing,\\nI ran upstairs to fetch my racquet.\\n\\nMrs. Cavendish was coming down the stairs. It may have been my fancy,\\nbut she, too, was looking odd and disturbed.\\n\\n“Had a good walk with Dr. Bauerstein?” I asked, trying to appear as\\nindifferent as I could.\\n\\n“I didn’t go,” she replied abruptly. “Where is Mrs. Inglethorp?”\\n\\n“In the boudoir.”\\n\\nHer hand clenched itself on the banisters, then she seemed to nerve\\nherself for some encounter, and went rapidly past me down the stairs\\nacross the hall to the boudoir, the door of which she shut behind her.\\n\\nAs I ran out to the tennis court a few moments later, I had to pass the\\nopen boudoir window, and was unable to help overhearing the following\\nscrap of dialogue. Mary Cavendish was saying in the voice of a woman\\ndesperately controlling herself:\\n\\n“Then you won’t show it to me?”\\n\\nTo which Mrs. Inglethorp replied:\\n\\n“My dear Mary, it has nothing to do with that matter.”\\n\\n“Then show it to me.”\\n\\n“I tell you it is not what you imagine. It does not concern you in the\\nleast.”\\n\\nTo which Mary Cavendish replied, with a rising bitterness:\\n\\n“Of course, I might have known you would shield him.”\\n\\nCynthia was waiting for me, and greeted me eagerly with:\\n\\n“I say! There’s been the most awful row! I’ve got it all out of\\nDorcas.”\\n\\n“What kind of a row?”\\n\\n“Between Aunt Emily and _him_. I do hope she’s found him out at last!”\\n\\n“Was Dorcas there, then?”\\n\\n“Of course not. She ‘happened to be near the door’. It was a real old\\nbust-up. I do wish I knew what it was all about.”\\n\\nI thought of Mrs. Raikes’s gipsy face, and Evelyn Howard’s warnings,\\nbut wisely decided to hold my peace, whilst Cynthia exhausted every\\npossible hypothesis, and cheerfully hoped, “Aunt Emily will send him\\naway, and will never speak to him again.”\\n\\nI was anxious to get hold of John, but he was nowhere to be seen.\\nEvidently something very momentous had occurred that afternoon. I tried\\nto forget the few words I had overheard; but, do what I would, I could\\nnot dismiss them altogether from my mind. What was Mary Cavendish’s\\nconcern in the matter?\\n\\nMr. Inglethorp was in the drawing-room when I came down to supper. His\\nface was impassive as ever, and the strange unreality of the man struck\\nme afresh.\\n\\nMrs. Inglethorp came down last. She still looked agitated, and during\\nthe meal there was a somewhat constrained silence. Inglethorp was\\nunusually quiet. As a rule, he surrounded his wife with little\\nattentions, placing a cushion at her back, and altogether playing the\\npart of the devoted husband. Immediately after supper, Mrs. Inglethorp\\nretired to her boudoir again.\\n\\n“Send my coffee in here, Mary,” she called. “I’ve just five minutes to\\ncatch the post.”\\n\\nCynthia and I went and sat by the open window in the drawing-room. Mary\\nCavendish brought our coffee to us. She seemed excited.\\n\\n“Do you young people want lights, or do you enjoy the twilight?” she\\nasked. “Will you take Mrs. Inglethorp her coffee, Cynthia? I will pour\\nit out.”\\n\\n“Do not trouble, Mary,” said Inglethorp. “I will take it to Emily.” He\\npoured it out, and went out of the room carrying it carefully.\\n\\nLawrence followed him, and Mrs. Cavendish sat down by us.\\n\\nWe three sat for some time in silence. It was a glorious night, hot and\\nstill. Mrs. Cavendish fanned herself gently with a palm leaf.\\n\\n“It’s almost too hot,” she murmured. “We shall have a thunderstorm.”\\n\\nAlas, that these harmonious moments can never endure! My paradise was\\nrudely shattered by the sound of a well known, and heartily disliked,\\nvoice in the hall.\\n\\n“Dr. Bauerstein!” exclaimed Cynthia. “What a funny time to come.”\\n\\nI glanced jealously at Mary Cavendish, but she seemed quite\\nundisturbed, the delicate pallor of her cheeks did not vary.\\n\\nIn a few moments, Alfred Inglethorp had ushered the doctor in, the\\nlatter laughing, and protesting that he was in no fit state for a\\ndrawing-room. In truth, he presented a sorry spectacle, being literally\\nplastered with mud.\\n\\n“What have you been doing, doctor?” cried Mrs. Cavendish.\\n\\n“I must make my apologies,” said the doctor. “I did not really mean to\\ncome in, but Mr. Inglethorp insisted.”\\n\\n“Well, Bauerstein, you are in a plight,” said John, strolling in from\\nthe hall. “Have some coffee, and tell us what you have been up to.”\\n\\n“Thank you, I will.” He laughed rather ruefully, as he described how he\\nhad discovered a very rare species of fern in an inaccessible place,\\nand in his efforts to obtain it had lost his footing, and slipped\\nignominiously into a neighbouring pond.\\n\\n“The sun soon dried me off,” he added, “but I’m afraid my appearance is\\nvery disreputable.”\\n\\nAt this juncture, Mrs. Inglethorp called to Cynthia from the hall, and\\nthe girl ran out.\\n\\n“Just carry up my despatch-case, will you, dear? I’m going to bed.”\\n\\nThe door into the hall was a wide one. I had risen when Cynthia did,\\nJohn was close by me. There were therefore three witnesses who could\\nswear that Mrs. Inglethorp was carrying her coffee, as yet untasted, in\\nher hand.\\n\\nMy evening was utterly and entirely spoilt by the presence of Dr.\\nBauerstein. It seemed to me the man would never go. He rose at last,\\nhowever, and I breathed a sigh of relief.\\n\\n“I’ll walk down to the village with you,” said Mr. Inglethorp. “I must\\nsee our agent over those estate accounts.” He turned to John. “No one\\nneed sit up. I will take the latch-key.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III.\\nTHE NIGHT OF THE TRAGEDY\\n\\n\\nTo make this part of my story clear, I append the following plan of the\\nfirst floor of Styles. The servants’ rooms are reached through the door\\nB. They have no communication with the right wing, where the\\nInglethorps’ rooms were situated.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nIt seemed to be the middle of the night when I was awakened by Lawrence\\nCavendish. He had a candle in his hand, and the agitation of his face\\ntold me at once that something was seriously wrong.\\n\\n“What’s the matter?” I asked, sitting up in bed, and trying to collect\\nmy scattered thoughts.\\n\\n“We are afraid my mother is very ill. She seems to be having some kind\\nof fit. Unfortunately she has locked herself in.”\\n\\n“I’ll come at once.”\\n\\nI sprang out of bed; and, pulling on a dressing-gown, followed Lawrence\\nalong the passage and the gallery to the right wing of the house.\\n\\nJohn Cavendish joined us, and one or two of the servants were standing\\nround in a state of awe-stricken excitement. Lawrence turned to his\\nbrother.\\n\\n“What do you think we had better do?”\\n\\nNever, I thought, had his indecision of character been more apparent.\\n\\nJohn rattled the handle of Mrs. Inglethorp’s door violently, but with\\nno effect. It was obviously locked or bolted on the inside. The whole\\nhousehold was aroused by now. The most alarming sounds were audible\\nfrom the interior of the room. Clearly something must be done.\\n\\n“Try going through Mr. Inglethorp’s room, sir,” cried Dorcas. “Oh, the\\npoor mistress!”\\n\\nSuddenly I realized that Alfred Inglethorp was not with us—that he\\nalone had given no sign of his presence. John opened the door of his\\nroom. It was pitch dark, but Lawrence was following with the candle,\\nand by its feeble light we saw that the bed had not been slept in, and\\nthat there was no sign of the room having been occupied.\\n\\nWe went straight to the connecting door. That, too, was locked or\\nbolted on the inside. What was to be done?\\n\\n“Oh, dear, sir,” cried Dorcas, wringing her hands, “what ever shall we\\ndo?”\\n\\n“We must try and break the door in, I suppose. It’ll be a tough job,\\nthough. Here, let one of the maids go down and wake Baily and tell him\\nto go for Dr. Wilkins at once. Now then, we’ll have a try at the door.\\nHalf a moment, though, isn’t there a door into Miss Cynthia’s rooms?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir, but that’s always bolted. It’s never been undone.”\\n\\n“Well, we might just see.”\\n\\nHe ran rapidly down the corridor to Cynthia’s room. Mary Cavendish was\\nthere, shaking the girl—who must have been an unusually sound\\nsleeper—and trying to wake her.\\n\\nIn a moment or two he was back.\\n\\n“No good. That’s bolted too. We must break in the door. I think this\\none is a shade less solid than the one in the passage.”\\n\\nWe strained and heaved together. The framework of the door was solid,\\nand for a long time it resisted our efforts, but at last we felt it\\ngive beneath our weight, and finally, with a resounding crash, it was\\nburst open.\\n\\nWe stumbled in together, Lawrence still holding his candle. Mrs.\\nInglethorp was lying on the bed, her whole form agitated by violent\\nconvulsions, in one of which she must have overturned the table beside\\nher. As we entered, however, her limbs relaxed, and she fell back upon\\nthe pillows.\\n\\nJohn strode across the room, and lit the gas. Turning to Annie, one of\\nthe housemaids, he sent her downstairs to the dining-room for brandy.\\nThen he went across to his mother whilst I unbolted the door that gave\\non the corridor.\\n\\nI turned to Lawrence, to suggest that I had better leave them now that\\nthere was no further need of my services, but the words were frozen on\\nmy lips. Never have I seen such a ghastly look on any man’s face. He\\nwas white as chalk, the candle he held in his shaking hand was\\nsputtering onto the carpet, and his eyes, petrified with terror, or\\nsome such kindred emotion, stared fixedly over my head at a point on\\nthe further wall. It was as though he had seen something that turned\\nhim to stone. I instinctively followed the direction of his eyes, but I\\ncould see nothing unusual. The still feebly flickering ashes in the\\ngrate, and the row of prim ornaments on the mantelpiece, were surely\\nharmless enough.\\n\\nThe violence of Mrs. Inglethorp’s attack seemed to be passing. She was\\nable to speak in short gasps.\\n\\n“Better now—very sudden—stupid of me—to lock myself in.”\\n\\nA shadow fell on the bed and, looking up, I saw Mary Cavendish standing\\nnear the door with her arm around Cynthia. She seemed to be supporting\\nthe girl, who looked utterly dazed and unlike herself. Her face was\\nheavily flushed, and she yawned repeatedly.\\n\\n“Poor Cynthia is quite frightened,” said Mrs. Cavendish in a low clear\\nvoice. She herself, I noticed, was dressed in her white land smock.\\nThen it must be later than I thought. I saw that a faint streak of\\ndaylight was showing through the curtains of the windows, and that the\\nclock on the mantelpiece pointed to close upon five o’clock.\\n\\nA strangled cry from the bed startled me. A fresh access of pain seized\\nthe unfortunate old lady. The convulsions were of a violence terrible\\nto behold. Everything was confusion. We thronged round her, powerless\\nto help or alleviate. A final convulsion lifted her from the bed, until\\nshe appeared to rest upon her head and her heels, with her body arched\\nin an extraordinary manner. In vain Mary and John tried to administer\\nmore brandy. The moments flew. Again the body arched itself in that\\npeculiar fashion.\\n\\nAt that moment, Dr. Bauerstein pushed his way authoritatively into the\\nroom. For one instant he stopped dead, staring at the figure on the\\nbed, and, at the same instant, Mrs. Inglethorp cried out in a strangled\\nvoice, her eyes fixed on the doctor:\\n\\n“Alfred—Alfred——” Then she fell back motionless on the pillows.\\n\\nWith a stride, the doctor reached the bed, and seizing her arms worked\\nthem energetically, applying what I knew to be artificial respiration.\\nHe issued a few short sharp orders to the servants. An imperious wave\\nof his hand drove us all to the door. We watched him, fascinated,\\nthough I think we all knew in our hearts that it was too late, and that\\nnothing could be done now. I could see by the expression on his face\\nthat he himself had little hope.\\n\\nFinally he abandoned his task, shaking his head gravely. At that\\nmoment, we heard footsteps outside, and Dr. Wilkins, Mrs. Inglethorp’s\\nown doctor, a portly, fussy little man, came bustling in.\\n\\nIn a few words Dr. Bauerstein explained how he had happened to be\\npassing the lodge gates as the car came out, and had run up to the\\nhouse as fast as he could, whilst the car went on to fetch Dr. Wilkins.\\nWith a faint gesture of the hand, he indicated the figure on the bed.\\n\\n“Ve—ry sad. Ve—ry sad,” murmured Dr. Wilkins. “Poor dear lady. Always\\ndid far too much—far too much—against my advice. I warned her. Her\\nheart was far from strong. ‘Take it easy,’ I said to her,\\n‘Take—it—easy’. But no—her zeal for good works was too great. Nature\\nrebelled. Na—ture—re—belled.”\\n\\nDr. Bauerstein, I noticed, was watching the local doctor narrowly. He\\nstill kept his eyes fixed on him as he spoke.\\n\\n“The convulsions were of a peculiar violence, Dr. Wilkins. I am sorry\\nyou were not here in time to witness them. They were quite—tetanic in\\ncharacter.”\\n\\n“Ah!” said Dr. Wilkins wisely.\\n\\n“I should like to speak to you in private,” said Dr. Bauerstein. He\\nturned to John. “You do not object?”\\n\\n“Certainly not.”\\n\\nWe all trooped out into the corridor, leaving the two doctors alone,\\nand I heard the key turned in the lock behind us.\\n\\nWe went slowly down the stairs. I was violently excited. I have a\\ncertain talent for deduction, and Dr. Bauerstein’s manner had started a\\nflock of wild surmises in my mind. Mary Cavendish laid her hand upon my\\narm.\\n\\n“What is it? Why did Dr. Bauerstein seem so—peculiar?”\\n\\nI looked at her.\\n\\n“Do you know what I think?”\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“Listen!” I looked round, the others were out of earshot. I lowered my\\nvoice to a whisper. “I believe she has been poisoned! I’m certain Dr.\\nBauerstein suspects it.”\\n\\n“_What?_” She shrank against the wall, the pupils of her eyes dilating\\nwildly. Then, with a sudden cry that startled me, she cried out: “No,\\nno—not that—not that!” And breaking from me, fled up the stairs. I\\nfollowed her, afraid that she was going to faint. I found her leaning\\nagainst the bannisters, deadly pale. She waved me away impatiently.\\n\\n“No, no—leave me. I’d rather be alone. Let me just be quiet for a\\nminute or two. Go down to the others.”\\n\\nI obeyed her reluctantly. John and Lawrence were in the dining-room. I\\njoined them. We were all silent, but I suppose I voiced the thoughts of\\nus all when I at last broke it by saying:\\n\\n“Where is Mr. Inglethorp?”\\n\\nJohn shook his head.\\n\\n“He’s not in the house.”\\n\\nOur eyes met. Where _was_ Alfred Inglethorp? His absence was strange\\nand inexplicable. I remembered Mrs. Inglethorp’s dying words. What lay\\nbeneath them? What more could she have told us, if she had had time?\\n\\nAt last we heard the doctors descending the stairs. Dr. Wilkins was\\nlooking important and excited, and trying to conceal an inward\\nexultation under a manner of decorous calm. Dr. Bauerstein remained in\\nthe background, his grave bearded face unchanged. Dr. Wilkins was the\\nspokesman for the two. He addressed himself to John:\\n\\n“Mr. Cavendish, I should like your consent to a post-mortem.”\\n\\n“Is that necessary?” asked John gravely. A spasm of pain crossed his\\nface.\\n\\n“Absolutely,” said Dr. Bauerstein.\\n\\n“You mean by that——?”\\n\\n“That neither Dr. Wilkins nor myself could give a death certificate\\nunder the circumstances.”\\n\\nJohn bent his head.\\n\\n“In that case, I have no alternative but to agree.”\\n\\n“Thank you,” said Dr. Wilkins briskly. “We propose that it should take\\nplace to-morrow night—or rather to-night.” And he glanced at the\\ndaylight. “Under the circumstances, I am afraid an inquest can hardly\\nbe avoided—these formalities are necessary, but I beg that you won’t\\ndistress yourselves.”\\n\\nThere was a pause, and then Dr. Bauerstein drew two keys from his\\npocket, and handed them to John.\\n\\n“These are the keys of the two rooms. I have locked them and, in my\\nopinion, they would be better kept locked for the present.”\\n\\nThe doctors then departed.\\n\\nI had been turning over an idea in my head, and I felt that the moment\\nhad now come to broach it. Yet I was a little chary of doing so. John,\\nI knew, had a horror of any kind of publicity, and was an easygoing\\noptimist, who preferred never to meet trouble half-way. It might be\\ndifficult to convince him of the soundness of my plan. Lawrence, on the\\nother hand, being less conventional, and having more imagination, I\\nfelt I might count upon as an ally. There was no doubt that the moment\\nhad come for me to take the lead.\\n\\n“John,” I said, “I am going to ask you something.”\\n\\n“Well?”\\n\\n“You remember my speaking of my friend Poirot? The Belgian who is here?\\nHe has been a most famous detective.”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“I want you to let me call him in—to investigate this matter.”\\n\\n“What—now? Before the post-mortem?”\\n\\n“Yes, time is an advantage if—if—there has been foul play.”\\n\\n“Rubbish!” cried Lawrence angrily. “In my opinion the whole thing is a\\nmare’s nest of Bauerstein’s! Wilkins hadn’t an idea of such a thing,\\nuntil Bauerstein put it into his head. But, like all specialists,\\nBauerstein’s got a bee in his bonnet. Poisons are his hobby, so of\\ncourse he sees them everywhere.”\\n\\nI confess that I was surprised by Lawrence’s attitude. He was so seldom\\nvehement about anything.\\n\\nJohn hesitated.\\n\\n“I can’t feel as you do, Lawrence,” he said at last. “I’m inclined to\\ngive Hastings a free hand, though I should prefer to wait a bit. We\\ndon’t want any unnecessary scandal.”\\n\\n“No, no,” I cried eagerly, “you need have no fear of that. Poirot is\\ndiscretion itself.”\\n\\n“Very well, then, have it your own way. I leave it in your hands.\\nThough, if it is as we suspect, it seems a clear enough case. God\\nforgive me if I am wronging him!”\\n\\nI looked at my watch. It was six o’clock. I determined to lose no time.\\n\\nFive minutes’ delay, however, I allowed myself. I spent it in\\nransacking the library until I discovered a medical book which gave a\\ndescription of strychnine poisoning.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV.\\nPOIROT INVESTIGATES\\n\\n\\nThe house which the Belgians occupied in the village was quite close to\\nthe park gates. One could save time by taking a narrow path through the\\nlong grass, which cut off the detours of the winding drive. So I,\\naccordingly, went that way. I had nearly reached the lodge, when my\\nattention was arrested by the running figure of a man approaching me.\\nIt was Mr. Inglethorp. Where had he been? How did he intend to explain\\nhis absence?\\n\\nHe accosted me eagerly.\\n\\n“My God! This is terrible! My poor wife! I have only just heard.”\\n\\n“Where have you been?” I asked.\\n\\n“Denby kept me late last night. It was one o’clock before we’d\\nfinished. Then I found that I’d forgotten the latch-key after all. I\\ndidn’t want to arouse the household, so Denby gave me a bed.”\\n\\n“How did you hear the news?” I asked.\\n\\n“Wilkins knocked Denby up to tell him. My poor Emily! She was so\\nself-sacrificing—such a noble character. She over-taxed her strength.”\\n\\nA wave of revulsion swept over me. What a consummate hypocrite the man\\nwas!\\n\\n“I must hurry on,” I said, thankful that he did not ask me whither I\\nwas bound.\\n\\nIn a few minutes I was knocking at the door of Leastways Cottage.\\n\\nGetting no answer, I repeated my summons impatiently. A window above me\\nwas cautiously opened, and Poirot himself looked out.\\n\\nHe gave an exclamation of surprise at seeing me. In a few brief words,\\nI explained the tragedy that had occurred, and that I wanted his help.\\n\\n“Wait, my friend, I will let you in, and you shall recount to me the\\naffair whilst I dress.”\\n\\nIn a few moments he had unbarred the door, and I followed him up to his\\nroom. There he installed me in a chair, and I related the whole story,\\nkeeping back nothing, and omitting no circumstance, however\\ninsignificant, whilst he himself made a careful and deliberate toilet.\\n\\nI told him of my awakening, of Mrs. Inglethorp’s dying words, of her\\nhusband’s absence, of the quarrel the day before, of the scrap of\\nconversation between Mary and her mother-in-law that I had overheard,\\nof the former quarrel between Mrs. Inglethorp and Evelyn Howard, and of\\nthe latter’s innuendoes.\\n\\nI was hardly as clear as I could wish. I repeated myself several times,\\nand occasionally had to go back to some detail that I had forgotten.\\nPoirot smiled kindly on me.\\n\\n“The mind is confused? Is it not so? Take time, _mon ami_. You are\\nagitated; you are excited—it is but natural. Presently, when we are\\ncalmer, we will arrange the facts, neatly, each in his proper place. We\\nwill examine—and reject. Those of importance we will put on one side;\\nthose of no importance, pouf!”—he screwed up his cherub-like face, and\\npuffed comically enough—“blow them away!”\\n\\n“That’s all very well,” I objected, “but how are you going to decide\\nwhat is important, and what isn’t? That always seems the difficulty to\\nme.”\\n\\nPoirot shook his head energetically. He was now arranging his moustache\\nwith exquisite care.\\n\\n“Not so. _Voyons!_ One fact leads to another—so we continue. Does the\\nnext fit in with that? _A merveille!_ Good! We can proceed. This next\\nlittle fact—no! Ah, that is curious! There is something missing—a link\\nin the chain that is not there. We examine. We search. And that little\\ncurious fact, that possibly paltry little detail that will not tally,\\nwe put it here!” He made an extravagant gesture with his hand. “It is\\nsignificant! It is tremendous!”\\n\\n“Y—es——”\\n\\n“Ah!” Poirot shook his forefinger so fiercely at me that I quailed\\nbefore it. “Beware! Peril to the detective who says: ‘It is so small—it\\ndoes not matter. It will not agree. I will forget it.’ That way lies\\nconfusion! Everything matters.”\\n\\n“I know. You always told me that. That’s why I have gone into all the\\ndetails of this thing whether they seemed to me relevant or not.”\\n\\n“And I am pleased with you. You have a good memory, and you have given\\nme the facts faithfully. Of the order in which you present them, I say\\nnothing—truly, it is deplorable! But I make allowances—you are upset.\\nTo that I attribute the circumstance that you have omitted one fact of\\nparamount importance.”\\n\\n“What is that?” I asked.\\n\\n“You have not told me if Mrs. Inglethorp ate well last night.”\\n\\nI stared at him. Surely the war had affected the little man’s brain. He\\nwas carefully engaged in brushing his coat before putting it on, and\\nseemed wholly engrossed in the task.\\n\\n“I don’t remember,” I said. “And, anyway, I don’t see——”\\n\\n“You do not see? But it is of the first importance.”\\n\\n“I can’t see why,” I said, rather nettled. “As far as I can remember,\\nshe didn’t eat much. She was obviously upset, and it had taken her\\nappetite away. That was only natural.”\\n\\n“Yes,” said Poirot thoughtfully, “it was only natural.”\\n\\nHe opened a drawer, and took out a small despatch-case, then turned to\\nme.\\n\\n“Now I am ready. We will proceed to the château, and study matters on\\nthe spot. Excuse me, _mon ami_, you dressed in haste, and your tie is\\non one side. Permit me.” With a deft gesture, he rearranged it.\\n\\n“_Ça y est!_ Now, shall we start?”\\n\\nWe hurried up the village, and turned in at the lodge gates. Poirot\\nstopped for a moment, and gazed sorrowfully over the beautiful expanse\\nof park, still glittering with morning dew.\\n\\n“So beautiful, so beautiful, and yet, the poor family, plunged in\\nsorrow, prostrated with grief.”\\n\\nHe looked at me keenly as he spoke, and I was aware that I reddened\\nunder his prolonged gaze.\\n\\nWas the family prostrated by grief? Was the sorrow at Mrs. Inglethorp’s\\ndeath so great? I realized that there was an emotional lack in the\\natmosphere. The dead woman had not the gift of commanding love. Her\\ndeath was a shock and a distress, but she would not be passionately\\nregretted.\\n\\nPoirot seemed to follow my thoughts. He nodded his head gravely.\\n\\n“No, you are right,” he said, “it is not as though there was a blood\\ntie. She has been kind and generous to these Cavendishes, but she was\\nnot their own mother. Blood tells—always remember that—blood tells.”\\n\\n“Poirot,” I said, “I wish you would tell me why you wanted to know if\\nMrs. Inglethorp ate well last night? I have been turning it over in my\\nmind, but I can’t see how it has anything to do with the matter?”\\n\\nHe was silent for a minute or two as we walked along, but finally he\\nsaid:\\n\\n“I do not mind telling you—though, as you know, it is not my habit to\\nexplain until the end is reached. The present contention is that Mrs.\\nInglethorp died of strychnine poisoning, presumably administered in her\\ncoffee.”\\n\\n“Yes?”\\n\\n“Well, what time was the coffee served?”\\n\\n“About eight o’clock.”\\n\\n“Therefore she drank it between then and half-past eight—certainly not\\nmuch later. Well, strychnine is a fairly rapid poison. Its effects\\nwould be felt very soon, probably in about an hour. Yet, in Mrs.\\nInglethorp’s case, the symptoms do not manifest themselves until five\\no’clock the next morning: nine hours! But a heavy meal, taken at about\\nthe same time as the poison, might retard its effects, though hardly to\\nthat extent. Still, it is a possibility to be taken into account. But,\\naccording to you, she ate very little for supper, and yet the symptoms\\ndo not develop until early the next morning! Now that is a curious\\ncircumstance, my friend. Something may arise at the autopsy to explain\\nit. In the meantime, remember it.”\\n\\nAs we neared the house, John came out and met us. His face looked weary\\nand haggard.\\n\\n“This is a very dreadful business, Monsieur Poirot,” he said. “Hastings\\nhas explained to you that we are anxious for no publicity?”\\n\\n“I comprehend perfectly.”\\n\\n“You see, it is only suspicion so far. We have nothing to go upon.”\\n\\n“Precisely. It is a matter of precaution only.”\\n\\nJohn turned to me, taking out his cigarette-case, and lighting a\\ncigarette as he did so.\\n\\n“You know that fellow Inglethorp is back?”\\n\\n“Yes. I met him.”\\n\\nJohn flung the match into an adjacent flower bed, a proceeding which\\nwas too much for Poirot’s feelings. He retrieved it, and buried it\\nneatly.\\n\\n“It’s jolly difficult to know how to treat him.”\\n\\n“That difficulty will not exist long,” pronounced Poirot quietly.\\n\\nJohn looked puzzled, not quite understanding the portent of this\\ncryptic saying. He handed the two keys which Dr. Bauerstein had given\\nhim to me.\\n\\n“Show Monsieur Poirot everything he wants to see.”\\n\\n“The rooms are locked?” asked Poirot.\\n\\n“Dr. Bauerstein considered it advisable.”\\n\\nPoirot nodded thoughtfully.\\n\\n“Then he is very sure. Well, that simplifies matters for us.”\\n\\nWe went up together to the room of the tragedy. For convenience I\\nappend a plan of the room and the principal articles of furniture in\\nit.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nPoirot locked the door on the inside, and proceeded to a minute\\ninspection of the room. He darted from one object to the other with the\\nagility of a grasshopper. I remained by the door, fearing to obliterate\\nany clues. Poirot, however, did not seem grateful to me for my\\nforbearance.\\n\\n“What have you, my friend,” he cried, “that you remain there like—how\\ndo you say it?—ah, yes, the stuck pig?”\\n\\nI explained that I was afraid of obliterating any foot-marks.\\n\\n“Foot-marks? But what an idea! There has already been practically an\\narmy in the room! What foot-marks are we likely to find? No, come here\\nand aid me in my search. I will put down my little case until I need\\nit.”\\n\\nHe did so, on the round table by the window, but it was an ill-advised\\nproceeding; for, the top of it being loose, it tilted up, and\\nprecipitated the despatch-case on the floor.\\n\\n“_Eh voilà une table!_” cried Poirot. “Ah, my friend, one may live in a\\nbig house and yet have no comfort.”\\n\\nAfter which piece of moralizing, he resumed his search.\\n\\nA small purple despatch-case, with a key in the lock, on the\\nwriting-table, engaged his attention for some time. He took out the key\\nfrom the lock, and passed it to me to inspect. I saw nothing peculiar,\\nhowever. It was an ordinary key of the Yale type, with a bit of twisted\\nwire through the handle.\\n\\nNext, he examined the framework of the door we had broken in, assuring\\nhimself that the bolt had really been shot. Then he went to the door\\nopposite leading into Cynthia’s room. That door was also bolted, as I\\nhad stated. However, he went to the length of unbolting it, and opening\\nand shutting it several times; this he did with the utmost precaution\\nagainst making any noise. Suddenly something in the bolt itself seemed\\nto rivet his attention. He examined it carefully, and then, nimbly\\nwhipping out a pair of small forceps from his case, he drew out some\\nminute particle which he carefully sealed up in a tiny envelope.\\n\\nOn the chest of drawers there was a tray with a spirit lamp and a small\\nsaucepan on it. A small quantity of a dark fluid remained in the\\nsaucepan, and an empty cup and saucer that had been drunk out of stood\\nnear it.\\n\\nI wondered how I could have been so unobservant as to overlook this.\\nHere was a clue worth having. Poirot delicately dipped his finger into\\nliquid, and tasted it gingerly. He made a grimace.\\n\\n“Cocoa—with—I think—rum in it.”\\n\\nHe passed on to the debris on the floor, where the table by the bed had\\nbeen overturned. A reading-lamp, some books, matches, a bunch of keys,\\nand the crushed fragments of a coffee-cup lay scattered about.\\n\\n“Ah, this is curious,” said Poirot.\\n\\n“I must confess that I see nothing particularly curious about it.”\\n\\n“You do not? Observe the lamp—the chimney is broken in two places; they\\nlie there as they fell. But see, the coffee-cup is absolutely smashed\\nto powder.”\\n\\n“Well,” I said wearily, “I suppose someone must have stepped on it.”\\n\\n“Exactly,” said Poirot, in an odd voice. “Someone stepped on it.”\\n\\nHe rose from his knees, and walked slowly across to the mantelpiece,\\nwhere he stood abstractedly fingering the ornaments, and straightening\\nthem—a trick of his when he was agitated.\\n\\n“_Mon ami_,” he said, turning to me, “somebody stepped on that cup,\\ngrinding it to powder, and the reason they did so was either because it\\ncontained strychnine or—which is far more serious—because it did not\\ncontain strychnine!”\\n\\nI made no reply. I was bewildered, but I knew that it was no good\\nasking him to explain. In a moment or two he roused himself, and went\\non with his investigations. He picked up the bunch of keys from the\\nfloor, and twirling them round in his fingers finally selected one,\\nvery bright and shining, which he tried in the lock of the purple\\ndespatch-case. It fitted, and he opened the box, but after a moment’s\\nhesitation, closed and relocked it, and slipped the bunch of keys, as\\nwell as the key that had originally stood in the lock, into his own\\npocket.\\n\\n“I have no authority to go through these papers. But it should be\\ndone—at once!”\\n\\nHe then made a very careful examination of the drawers of the\\nwash-stand. Crossing the room to the left-hand window, a round stain,\\nhardly visible on the dark brown carpet, seemed to interest him\\nparticularly. He went down on his knees, examining it minutely—even\\ngoing so far as to smell it.\\n\\nFinally, he poured a few drops of the cocoa into a test tube, sealing\\nit up carefully. His next proceeding was to take out a little notebook.\\n\\n“We have found in this room,” he said, writing busily, “six points of\\ninterest. Shall I enumerate them, or will you?”\\n\\n“Oh, you,” I replied hastily.\\n\\n“Very well, then. One, a coffee-cup that has been ground into powder;\\ntwo, a despatch-case with a key in the lock; three, a stain on the\\nfloor.”\\n\\n“That may have been done some time ago,” I interrupted.\\n\\n“No, for it is still perceptibly damp and smells of coffee. Four, a\\nfragment of some dark green fabric—only a thread or two, but\\nrecognizable.”\\n\\n“Ah!” I cried. “That was what you sealed up in the envelope.”\\n\\n“Yes. It may turn out to be a piece of one of Mrs. Inglethorp’s own\\ndresses, and quite unimportant. We shall see. Five, _this_!” With a\\ndramatic gesture, he pointed to a large splash of candle grease on the\\nfloor by the writing-table. “It must have been done since yesterday,\\notherwise a good housemaid would have at once removed it with\\nblotting-paper and a hot iron. One of my best hats once—but that is not\\nto the point.”\\n\\n“It was very likely done last night. We were very agitated. Or perhaps\\nMrs. Inglethorp herself dropped her candle.”\\n\\n“You brought only one candle into the room?”\\n\\n“Yes. Lawrence Cavendish was carrying it. But he was very upset. He\\nseemed to see something over here”—I indicated the mantelpiece—“that\\nabsolutely paralysed him.”\\n\\n“That is interesting,” said Poirot quickly. “Yes, it is suggestive”—his\\neye sweeping the whole length of the wall—“but it was not his candle\\nthat made this great patch, for you perceive that this is white grease;\\nwhereas Monsieur Lawrence’s candle, which is still on the\\ndressing-table, is pink. On the other hand, Mrs. Inglethorp had no\\ncandlestick in the room, only a reading-lamp.”\\n\\n“Then,” I said, “what do you deduce?”\\n\\nTo which my friend only made a rather irritating reply, urging me to\\nuse my own natural faculties.\\n\\n“And the sixth point?” I asked. “I suppose it is the sample of cocoa.”\\n\\n“No,” said Poirot thoughtfully. “I might have included that in the six,\\nbut I did not. No, the sixth point I will keep to myself for the\\npresent.”\\n\\nHe looked quickly round the room. “There is nothing more to be done\\nhere, I think, unless”—he stared earnestly and long at the dead ashes\\nin the grate. “The fire burns—and it destroys. But by chance—there\\nmight be—let us see!”\\n\\nDeftly, on hands and knees, he began to sort the ashes from the grate\\ninto the fender, handling them with the greatest caution. Suddenly, he\\ngave a faint exclamation.\\n\\n“The forceps, Hastings!”\\n\\nI quickly handed them to him, and with skill he extracted a small piece\\nof half charred paper.\\n\\n“There, _mon ami!_” he cried. “What do you think of that?”\\n\\nI scrutinized the fragment. This is an exact reproduction of it:—\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nI was puzzled. It was unusually thick, quite unlike ordinary notepaper.\\nSuddenly an idea struck me.\\n\\n“Poirot!” I cried. “This is a fragment of a will!”\\n\\n“Exactly.”\\n\\nI looked up at him sharply.\\n\\n“You are not surprised?”\\n\\n“No,” he said gravely, “I expected it.”\\n\\nI relinquished the piece of paper, and watched him put it away in his\\ncase, with the same methodical care that he bestowed on everything. My\\nbrain was in a whirl. What was this complication of a will? Who had\\ndestroyed it? The person who had left the candle grease on the floor?\\nObviously. But how had anyone gained admission? All the doors had been\\nbolted on the inside.\\n\\n“Now, my friend,” said Poirot briskly, “we will go. I should like to\\nask a few questions of the parlourmaid—Dorcas, her name is, is it not?”\\n\\nWe passed through Alfred Inglethorp’s room, and Poirot delayed long\\nenough to make a brief but fairly comprehensive examination of it. We\\nwent out through that door, locking both it and that of Mrs.\\nInglethorp’s room as before.\\n\\nI took him down to the boudoir which he had expressed a wish to see,\\nand went myself in search of Dorcas.\\n\\nWhen I returned with her, however, the boudoir was empty.\\n\\n“Poirot,” I cried, “where are you?”\\n\\n“I am here, my friend.”\\n\\nHe had stepped outside the French window, and was standing, apparently\\nlost in admiration, before the various shaped flower beds.\\n\\n“Admirable!” he murmured. “Admirable! What symmetry! Observe that\\ncrescent; and those diamonds—their neatness rejoices the eye. The\\nspacing of the plants, also, is perfect. It has been recently done; is\\nit not so?”\\n\\n“Yes, I believe they were at it yesterday afternoon. But come in—Dorcas\\nis here.”\\n\\n“_Eh bien, eh bien!_ Do not grudge me a moment’s satisfaction of the\\neye.”\\n\\n“Yes, but this affair is more important.”\\n\\n“And how do you know that these fine begonias are not of equal\\nimportance?”\\n\\nI shrugged my shoulders. There was really no arguing with him if he\\nchose to take that line.\\n\\n“You do not agree? But such things have been. Well, we will come in and\\ninterview the brave Dorcas.”\\n\\nDorcas was standing in the boudoir, her hands folded in front of her,\\nand her grey hair rose in stiff waves under her white cap. She was the\\nvery model and picture of a good old-fashioned servant.\\n\\nIn her attitude towards Poirot, she was inclined to be suspicious, but\\nhe soon broke down her defences. He drew forward a chair.\\n\\n“Pray be seated, mademoiselle.”\\n\\n“Thank you, sir.”\\n\\n“You have been with your mistress many years, is it not so?”\\n\\n“Ten years, sir.”\\n\\n“That is a long time, and very faithful service. You were much attached\\nto her, were you not?”\\n\\n“She was a very good mistress to me, sir.”\\n\\n“Then you will not object to answering a few questions. I put them to\\nyou with Mr. Cavendish’s full approval.”\\n\\n“Oh, certainly, sir.”\\n\\n“Then I will begin by asking you about the events of yesterday\\nafternoon. Your mistress had a quarrel?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir. But I don’t know that I ought——” Dorcas hesitated.\\n\\nPoirot looked at her keenly.\\n\\n“My good Dorcas, it is necessary that I should know every detail of\\nthat quarrel as fully as possible. Do not think that you are betraying\\nyour mistress’s secrets. Your mistress lies dead, and it is necessary\\nthat we should know all—if we are to avenge her. Nothing can bring her\\nback to life, but we do hope, if there has been foul play, to bring the\\nmurderer to justice.”\\n\\n“Amen to that,” said Dorcas fiercely. “And, naming no names, there’s\\n_one_ in this house that none of us could ever abide! And an ill day it\\nwas when first _he_ darkened the threshold.”\\n\\nPoirot waited for her indignation to subside, and then, resuming his\\nbusiness-like tone, he asked:\\n\\n“Now, as to this quarrel? What is the first you heard of it?”\\n\\n“Well, sir, I happened to be going along the hall outside yesterday——”\\n\\n“What time was that?”\\n\\n“I couldn’t say exactly, sir, but it wasn’t tea-time by a long way.\\nPerhaps four o’clock—or it may have been a bit later. Well, sir, as I\\nsaid, I happened to be passing along, when I heard voices very loud and\\nangry in here. I didn’t exactly mean to listen, but—well, there it is.\\nI stopped. The door was shut, but the mistress was speaking very sharp\\nand clear, and I heard what she said quite plainly. ‘You have lied to\\nme, and deceived me,’ she said. I didn’t hear what Mr. Inglethorp\\nreplied. He spoke a good bit lower than she did—but she answered: ‘How\\ndare you? I have kept you and clothed you and fed you! You owe\\neverything to me! And this is how you repay me! By bringing disgrace\\nupon our name!’ Again I didn’t hear what he said, but she went on:\\n‘Nothing that you can say will make any difference. I see my duty\\nclearly. My mind is made up. You need not think that any fear of\\npublicity, or scandal between husband and wife will deter me.’ Then I\\nthought I heard them coming out, so I went off quickly.”\\n\\n“You are sure it was Mr. Inglethorp’s voice you heard?”\\n\\n“Oh, yes, sir, whose else’s could it be?”\\n\\n“Well, what happened next?”\\n\\n“Later, I came back to the hall; but it was all quiet. At five o’clock,\\nMrs. Inglethorp rang the bell and told me to bring her a cup of\\ntea—nothing to eat—to the boudoir. She was looking dreadful—so white\\nand upset. ‘Dorcas,’ she says, ‘I’ve had a great shock.’ ‘I’m sorry for\\nthat, m’m,’ I says. ‘You’ll feel better after a nice hot cup of tea,\\nm’m.’ She had something in her hand. I don’t know if it was a letter,\\nor just a piece of paper, but it had writing on it, and she kept\\nstaring at it, almost as if she couldn’t believe what was written\\nthere. She whispered to herself, as though she had forgotten I was\\nthere: ‘These few words—and everything’s changed.’ And then she says to\\nme: ‘Never trust a man, Dorcas, they’re not worth it!’ I hurried off,\\nand got her a good strong cup of tea, and she thanked me, and said\\nshe’d feel better when she’d drunk it. ‘I don’t know what to do,’ she\\nsays. ‘Scandal between husband and wife is a dreadful thing, Dorcas.\\nI’d rather hush it up if I could.’ Mrs. Cavendish came in just then, so\\nshe didn’t say any more.”\\n\\n“She still had the letter, or whatever it was, in her hand?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes, sir.”\\n\\n“What would she be likely to do with it afterwards?”\\n\\n“Well, I don’t know, sir, I expect she would lock it up in that purple\\ncase of hers.”\\n\\n“Is that where she usually kept important papers?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir. She brought it down with her every morning, and took it up\\nevery night.”\\n\\n“When did she lose the key of it?”\\n\\n“She missed it yesterday at lunch-time, sir, and told me to look\\ncarefully for it. She was very much put out about it.”\\n\\n“But she had a duplicate key?”\\n\\n“Oh, yes, sir.”\\n\\nDorcas was looking very curiously at him and, to tell the truth, so was\\nI. What was all this about a lost key? Poirot smiled.\\n\\n“Never mind, Dorcas, it is my business to know things. Is this the key\\nthat was lost?” He drew from his pocket the key that he had found in\\nthe lock of the despatch-case upstairs.\\n\\nDorcas’s eyes looked as though they would pop out of her head.\\n\\n“That’s it, sir, right enough. But where did you find it? I looked\\neverywhere for it.”\\n\\n“Ah, but you see it was not in the same place yesterday as it was\\nto-day. Now, to pass to another subject, had your mistress a dark green\\ndress in her wardrobe?”\\n\\nDorcas was rather startled by the unexpected question.\\n\\n“No, sir.”\\n\\n“Are you quite sure?”\\n\\n“Oh, yes, sir.”\\n\\n“Has anyone else in the house got a green dress?”\\n\\nDorcas reflected.\\n\\n“Miss Cynthia has a green evening dress.”\\n\\n“Light or dark green?”\\n\\n“A light green, sir; a sort of chiffon, they call it.”\\n\\n“Ah, that is not what I want. And nobody else has anything green?”\\n\\n“No, sir—not that I know of.”\\n\\nPoirot’s face did not betray a trace of whether he was disappointed or\\notherwise. He merely remarked:\\n\\n“Good, we will leave that and pass on. Have you any reason to believe\\nthat your mistress was likely to take a sleeping powder last night?”\\n\\n“Not _last_ night, sir, I know she didn’t.”\\n\\n“Why do you know so positively?”\\n\\n“Because the box was empty. She took the last one two days ago, and she\\ndidn’t have any more made up.”\\n\\n“You are quite sure of that?”\\n\\n“Positive, sir.”\\n\\n“Then that is cleared up! By the way, your mistress didn’t ask you to\\nsign any paper yesterday?”\\n\\n“To sign a paper? No, sir.”\\n\\n“When Mr. Hastings and Mr. Lawrence came in yesterday evening, they\\nfound your mistress busy writing letters. I suppose you can give me no\\nidea to whom these letters were addressed?”\\n\\n“I’m afraid I couldn’t, sir. I was out in the evening. Perhaps Annie\\ncould tell you, though she’s a careless girl. Never cleared the\\ncoffee-cups away last night. That’s what happens when I’m not here to\\nlook after things.”\\n\\nPoirot lifted his hand.\\n\\n“Since they have been left, Dorcas, leave them a little longer, I pray\\nyou. I should like to examine them.”\\n\\n“Very well, sir.”\\n\\n“What time did you go out last evening?”\\n\\n“About six o’clock, sir.”\\n\\n“Thank you, Dorcas, that is all I have to ask you.” He rose and\\nstrolled to the window. “I have been admiring these flower beds. How\\nmany gardeners are employed here, by the way?”\\n\\n“Only three now, sir. Five, we had, before the war, when it was kept as\\na gentleman’s place should be. I wish you could have seen it then, sir.\\nA fair sight it was. But now there’s only old Manning, and young\\nWilliam, and a new-fashioned woman gardener in breeches and such-like.\\nAh, these are dreadful times!”\\n\\n“The good times will come again, Dorcas. At least, we hope so. Now,\\nwill you send Annie to me here?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.”\\n\\n“How did you know that Mrs. Inglethorp took sleeping powders?” I asked,\\nin lively curiosity, as Dorcas left the room. “And about the lost key\\nand the duplicate?”\\n\\n“One thing at a time. As to the sleeping powders, I knew by this.” He\\nsuddenly produced a small cardboard box, such as chemists use for\\npowders.\\n\\n“Where did you find it?”\\n\\n“In the wash-stand drawer in Mrs. Inglethorp’s bedroom. It was Number\\nSix of my catalogue.”\\n\\n“But I suppose, as the last powder was taken two days ago, it is not of\\nmuch importance?”\\n\\n“Probably not, but do you notice anything that strikes you as peculiar\\nabout this box?”\\n\\nI examined it closely.\\n\\n“No, I can’t say that I do.”\\n\\n“Look at the label.”\\n\\nI read the label carefully: “‘One powder to be taken at bedtime, if\\nrequired. Mrs. Inglethorp.’ No, I see nothing unusual.”\\n\\n“Not the fact that there is no chemist’s name?”\\n\\n“Ah!” I exclaimed. “To be sure, that is odd!”\\n\\n“Have you ever known a chemist to send out a box like that, without his\\nprinted name?”\\n\\n“No, I can’t say that I have.”\\n\\nI was becoming quite excited, but Poirot damped my ardour by remarking:\\n\\n“Yet the explanation is quite simple. So do not intrigue yourself, my\\nfriend.”\\n\\nAn audible creaking proclaimed the approach of Annie, so I had no time\\nto reply.\\n\\nAnnie was a fine, strapping girl, and was evidently labouring under\\nintense excitement, mingled with a certain ghoulish enjoyment of the\\ntragedy.\\n\\nPoirot came to the point at once, with a business-like briskness.\\n\\n“I sent for you, Annie, because I thought you might be able to tell me\\nsomething about the letters Mrs. Inglethorp wrote last night. How many\\nwere there? And can you tell me any of the names and addresses?”\\n\\nAnnie considered.\\n\\n“There were four letters, sir. One was to Miss Howard, and one was to\\nMr. Wells, the lawyer, and the other two I don’t think I remember,\\nsir—oh, yes, one was to Ross’s, the caterers in Tadminster. The other\\none, I don’t remember.”\\n\\n“Think,” urged Poirot.\\n\\nAnnie racked her brains in vain.\\n\\n“I’m sorry, sir, but it’s clean gone. I don’t think I can have noticed\\nit.”\\n\\n“It does not matter,” said Poirot, not betraying any sign of\\ndisappointment. “Now I want to ask you about something else. There is a\\nsaucepan in Mrs. Inglethorp’s room with some cocoa in it. Did she have\\nthat every night?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir, it was put in her room every evening, and she warmed it up\\nin the night—whenever she fancied it.”\\n\\n“What was it? Plain cocoa?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir, made with milk, with a teaspoonful of sugar, and two\\nteaspoonfuls of rum in it.”\\n\\n“Who took it to her room?”\\n\\n“I did, sir.”\\n\\n“Always?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir.”\\n\\n“At what time?”\\n\\n“When I went to draw the curtains, as a rule, sir.”\\n\\n“Did you bring it straight up from the kitchen then?”\\n\\n“No, sir, you see there’s not much room on the gas stove, so cook used\\nto make it early, before putting the vegetables on for supper. Then I\\nused to bring it up, and put it on the table by the swing door, and\\ntake it into her room later.”\\n\\n“The swing door is in the left wing, is it not?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir.”\\n\\n“And the table, is it on this side of the door, or on the\\nfarther—servants’ side?”\\n\\n“It’s this side, sir.”\\n\\n“What time did you bring it up last night?”\\n\\n“About quarter-past seven, I should say, sir.”\\n\\n“And when did you take it into Mrs. Inglethorp’s room?”\\n\\n“When I went to shut up, sir. About eight o’clock. Mrs. Inglethorp came\\nup to bed before I’d finished.”\\n\\n“Then, between seven-fifteen and eight o’clock, the cocoa was standing\\non the table in the left wing?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir.” Annie had been growing redder and redder in the face, and\\nnow she blurted out unexpectedly:\\n\\n“And if there _was_ salt in it, sir, it wasn’t me. I never took the\\nsalt near it.”\\n\\n“What makes you think there was salt in it?” asked Poirot.\\n\\n“Seeing it on the tray, sir.”\\n\\n“You saw some salt on the tray?”\\n\\n“Yes. Coarse kitchen salt, it looked. I never noticed it when I took\\nthe tray up, but when I came to take it into the mistress’s room I saw\\nit at once, and I suppose I ought to have taken it down again, and\\nasked cook to make some fresh. But I was in a hurry, because Dorcas was\\nout, and I thought maybe the cocoa itself was all right, and the salt\\nhad only gone on the tray. So I dusted it off with my apron, and took\\nit in.”\\n\\nI had the utmost difficulty in controlling my excitement. Unknown to\\nherself, Annie had provided us with an important piece of evidence. How\\nshe would have gaped if she had realized that her “coarse kitchen salt”\\nwas strychnine, one of the most deadly poisons known to mankind. I\\nmarvelled at Poirot’s calm. His self-control was astonishing. I awaited\\nhis next question with impatience, but it disappointed me.\\n\\n“When you went into Mrs. Inglethorp’s room, was the door leading into\\nMiss Cynthia’s room bolted?”\\n\\n“Oh! Yes, sir; it always was. It had never been opened.”\\n\\n“And the door into Mr. Inglethorp’s room? Did you notice if that was\\nbolted too?”\\n\\nAnnie hesitated.\\n\\n“I couldn’t rightly say, sir; it was shut but I couldn’t say whether it\\nwas bolted or not.”\\n\\n“When you finally left the room, did Mrs. Inglethorp bolt the door\\nafter you?”\\n\\n“No, sir, not then, but I expect she did later. She usually did lock it\\nat night. The door into the passage, that is.”\\n\\n“Did you notice any candle grease on the floor when you did the room\\nyesterday?”\\n\\n“Candle grease? Oh, no, sir. Mrs. Inglethorp didn’t have a candle, only\\na reading-lamp.”\\n\\n“Then, if there had been a large patch of candle grease on the floor,\\nyou think you would have been sure to have seen it?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir, and I would have taken it out with a piece of blotting-paper\\nand a hot iron.”\\n\\nThen Poirot repeated the question he had put to Dorcas:\\n\\n“Did your mistress ever have a green dress?”\\n\\n“No, sir.”\\n\\n“Nor a mantle, nor a cape, nor a—how do you call it?—a sports coat?”\\n\\n“Not green, sir.”\\n\\n“Nor anyone else in the house?”\\n\\nAnnie reflected.\\n\\n“No, sir.”\\n\\n“You are sure of that?”\\n\\n“Quite sure.”\\n\\n“_Bien!_ That is all I want to know. Thank you very much.”\\n\\nWith a nervous giggle, Annie took herself creakingly out of the room.\\nMy pent-up excitement burst forth.\\n\\n“Poirot,” I cried, “I congratulate you! This is a great discovery.”\\n\\n“What is a great discovery?”\\n\\n“Why, that it was the cocoa and not the coffee that was poisoned. That\\nexplains everything! Of course it did not take effect until the early\\nmorning, since the cocoa was only drunk in the middle of the night.”\\n\\n“So you think that the cocoa—mark well what I say, Hastings, the\\n_cocoa_—contained strychnine?”\\n\\n“Of course! That salt on the tray, what else could it have been?”\\n\\n“It might have been salt,” replied Poirot placidly.\\n\\nI shrugged my shoulders. If he was going to take the matter that way,\\nit was no good arguing with him. The idea crossed my mind, not for the\\nfirst time, that poor old Poirot was growing old. Privately I thought\\nit lucky that he had associated with him someone of a more receptive\\ntype of mind.\\n\\nPoirot was surveying me with quietly twinkling eyes.\\n\\n“You are not pleased with me, _mon ami?_”\\n\\n“My dear Poirot,” I said coldly, “it is not for me to dictate to you.\\nYou have a right to your own opinion, just as I have to mine.”\\n\\n“A most admirable sentiment,” remarked Poirot, rising briskly to his\\nfeet. “Now I have finished with this room. By the way, whose is the\\nsmaller desk in the corner?”\\n\\n“Mr. Inglethorp’s.”\\n\\n“Ah!” He tried the roll top tentatively. “Locked. But perhaps one of\\nMrs. Inglethorp’s keys would open it.” He tried several, twisting and\\nturning them with a practiced hand, and finally uttering an ejaculation\\nof satisfaction. “_Voilà!_ It is not the key, but it will open it at a\\npinch.” He slid back the roll top, and ran a rapid eye over the neatly\\nfiled papers. To my surprise, he did not examine them, merely remarking\\napprovingly as he relocked the desk: “Decidedly, he is a man of method,\\nthis Mr. Inglethorp!”\\n\\nA “man of method” was, in Poirot’s estimation, the highest praise that\\ncould be bestowed on any individual.\\n\\nI felt that my friend was not what he had been as he rambled on\\ndisconnectedly:\\n\\n“There were no stamps in his desk, but there might have been, eh, _mon\\nami?_ There might have been? Yes”—his eyes wandered round the\\nroom—“this boudoir has nothing more to tell us. It did not yield much.\\nOnly this.”\\n\\nHe pulled a crumpled envelope out of his pocket, and tossed it over to\\nme. It was rather a curious document. A plain, dirty looking old\\nenvelope with a few words scrawled across it, apparently at random. The\\nfollowing is a facsimile of it.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V.\\n“IT ISN’T STRYCHNINE, IS IT?”\\n\\n\\n“Where did you find this?” I asked Poirot, in lively curiosity.\\n\\n“In the waste-paper basket. You recognise the handwriting?”\\n\\n“Yes, it is Mrs. Inglethorp’s. But what does it mean?”\\n\\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n“I cannot say—but it is suggestive.”\\n\\nA wild idea flashed across me. Was it possible that Mrs. Inglethorp’s\\nmind was deranged? Had she some fantastic idea of demoniacal\\npossession? And, if that were so, was it not also possible that she\\nmight have taken her own life?\\n\\nI was about to expound these theories to Poirot, when his own words\\ndistracted me.\\n\\n“Come,” he said, “now to examine the coffee-cups!”\\n\\n“My dear Poirot! What on earth is the good of that, now that we know\\nabout the cocoa?”\\n\\n“Oh, _là là!_ That miserable cocoa!” cried Poirot flippantly.\\n\\nHe laughed with apparent enjoyment, raising his arms to heaven in mock\\ndespair, in what I could not but consider the worst possible taste.\\n\\n“And, anyway,” I said, with increasing coldness, “as Mrs. Inglethorp\\ntook her coffee upstairs with her, I do not see what you expect to\\nfind, unless you consider it likely that we shall discover a packet of\\nstrychnine on the coffee tray!”\\n\\nPoirot was sobered at once.\\n\\n“Come, come, my friend,” he said, slipping his arms through mine. “_Ne\\nvous fâchez pas!_ Allow me to interest myself in my coffee-cups, and I\\nwill respect your cocoa. There! Is it a bargain?”\\n\\nHe was so quaintly humorous that I was forced to laugh; and we went\\ntogether to the drawing-room, where the coffee-cups and tray remained\\nundisturbed as we had left them.\\n\\nPoirot made me recapitulate the scene of the night before, listening\\nvery carefully, and verifying the position of the various cups.\\n\\n“So Mrs. Cavendish stood by the tray—and poured out. Yes. Then she came\\nacross to the window where you sat with Mademoiselle Cynthia. Yes. Here\\nare the three cups. And the cup on the mantelpiece, half drunk, that\\nwould be Mr. Lawrence Cavendish’s. And the one on the tray?”\\n\\n“John Cavendish’s. I saw him put it down there.”\\n\\n“Good. One, two, three, four, five—but where, then, is the cup of Mr.\\nInglethorp?”\\n\\n“He does not take coffee.”\\n\\n“Then all are accounted for. One moment, my friend.”\\n\\nWith infinite care, he took a drop or two from the grounds in each cup,\\nsealing them up in separate test tubes, tasting each in turn as he did\\nso. His physiognomy underwent a curious change. An expression gathered\\nthere that I can only describe as half puzzled, and half relieved.\\n\\n“_Bien!_” he said at last. “It is evident! I had an idea—but clearly I\\nwas mistaken. Yes, altogether I was mistaken. Yet it is strange. But no\\nmatter!”\\n\\nAnd, with a characteristic shrug, he dismissed whatever it was that was\\nworrying him from his mind. I could have told him from the beginning\\nthat this obsession of his over the coffee was bound to end in a blind\\nalley, but I restrained my tongue. After all, though he was old, Poirot\\nhad been a great man in his day.\\n\\n“Breakfast is ready,” said John Cavendish, coming in from the hall.\\n“You will breakfast with us, Monsieur Poirot?”\\n\\nPoirot acquiesced. I observed John. Already he was almost restored to\\nhis normal self. The shock of the events of the last night had upset\\nhim temporarily, but his equable poise soon swung back to the normal.\\nHe was a man of very little imagination, in sharp contrast with his\\nbrother, who had, perhaps, too much.\\n\\nEver since the early hours of the morning, John had been hard at work,\\nsending telegrams—one of the first had gone to Evelyn Howard—writing\\nnotices for the papers, and generally occupying himself with the\\nmelancholy duties that a death entails.\\n\\n“May I ask how things are proceeding?” he said. “Do your investigations\\npoint to my mother having died a natural death—or—or must we prepare\\nourselves for the worst?”\\n\\n“I think, Mr. Cavendish,” said Poirot gravely, “that you would do well\\nnot to buoy yourself up with any false hopes. Can you tell me the views\\nof the other members of the family?”\\n\\n“My brother Lawrence is convinced that we are making a fuss over\\nnothing. He says that everything points to its being a simple case of\\nheart failure.”\\n\\n“He does, does he? That is very interesting—very interesting,” murmured\\nPoirot softly. “And Mrs. Cavendish?”\\n\\nA faint cloud passed over John’s face.\\n\\n“I have not the least idea what my wife’s views on the subject are.”\\n\\nThe answer brought a momentary stiffness in its train. John broke the\\nrather awkward silence by saying with a slight effort:\\n\\n“I told you, didn’t I, that Mr. Inglethorp has returned?”\\n\\nPoirot bent his head.\\n\\n“It’s an awkward position for all of us. Of course one has to treat him\\nas usual—but, hang it all, one’s gorge does rise at sitting down to eat\\nwith a possible murderer!”\\n\\nPoirot nodded sympathetically.\\n\\n“I quite understand. It is a very difficult situation for you, Mr.\\nCavendish. I would like to ask you one question. Mr. Inglethorp’s\\nreason for not returning last night was, I believe, that he had\\nforgotten the latch-key. Is not that so?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“I suppose you are quite sure that the latch-key _was_ forgotten—that\\nhe did not take it after all?”\\n\\n“I have no idea. I never thought of looking. We always keep it in the\\nhall drawer. I’ll go and see if it’s there now.”\\n\\nPoirot held up his hand with a faint smile.\\n\\n“No, no, Mr. Cavendish, it is too late now. I am certain that you would\\nfind it. If Mr. Inglethorp did take it, he has had ample time to\\nreplace it by now.”\\n\\n“But do you think——”\\n\\n“I think nothing. If anyone had chanced to look this morning before his\\nreturn, and seen it there, it would have been a valuable point in his\\nfavour. That is all.”\\n\\nJohn looked perplexed.\\n\\n“Do not worry,” said Poirot smoothly. “I assure you that you need not\\nlet it trouble you. Since you are so kind, let us go and have some\\nbreakfast.”\\n\\nEveryone was assembled in the dining-room. Under the circumstances, we\\nwere naturally not a cheerful party. The reaction after a shock is\\nalways trying, and I think we were all suffering from it. Decorum and\\ngood breeding naturally enjoined that our demeanour should be much as\\nusual, yet I could not help wondering if this self-control were really\\na matter of great difficulty. There were no red eyes, no signs of\\nsecretly indulged grief. I felt that I was right in my opinion that\\nDorcas was the person most affected by the personal side of the\\ntragedy.\\n\\nI pass over Alfred Inglethorp, who acted the bereaved widower in a\\nmanner that I felt to be disgusting in its hypocrisy. Did he know that\\nwe suspected him, I wondered. Surely he could not be unaware of the\\nfact, conceal it as we would. Did he feel some secret stirring of fear,\\nor was he confident that his crime would go unpunished? Surely the\\nsuspicion in the atmosphere must warn him that he was already a marked\\nman.\\n\\nBut did everyone suspect him? What about Mrs. Cavendish? I watched her\\nas she sat at the head of the table, graceful, composed, enigmatic. In\\nher soft grey frock, with white ruffles at the wrists falling over her\\nslender hands, she looked very beautiful. When she chose, however, her\\nface could be sphinx-like in its inscrutability. She was very silent,\\nhardly opening her lips, and yet in some queer way I felt that the\\ngreat strength of her personality was dominating us all.\\n\\nAnd little Cynthia? Did she suspect? She looked very tired and ill, I\\nthought. The heaviness and languor of her manner were very marked. I\\nasked her if she were feeling ill, and she answered frankly:\\n\\n“Yes, I’ve got the most beastly headache.”\\n\\n“Have another cup of coffee, mademoiselle?” said Poirot solicitously.\\n“It will revive you. It is unparalleled for the _mal de tête_.” He\\njumped up and took her cup.\\n\\n“No sugar,” said Cynthia, watching him, as he picked up the\\nsugar-tongs.\\n\\n“No sugar? You abandon it in the war-time, eh?”\\n\\n“No, I never take it in coffee.”\\n\\n“_Sacré!_” murmured Poirot to himself, as he brought back the\\nreplenished cup.\\n\\nOnly I heard him, and glancing up curiously at the little man I saw\\nthat his face was working with suppressed excitement, and his eyes were\\nas green as a cat’s. He had heard or seen something that had affected\\nhim strongly—but what was it? I do not usually label myself as dense,\\nbut I must confess that nothing out of the ordinary had attracted _my_\\nattention.\\n\\nIn another moment, the door opened and Dorcas appeared.\\n\\n“Mr. Wells to see you, sir,” she said to John.\\n\\nI remembered the name as being that of the lawyer to whom Mrs.\\nInglethorp had written the night before.\\n\\nJohn rose immediately.\\n\\n“Show him into my study.” Then he turned to us. “My mother’s lawyer,”\\nhe explained. And in a lower voice: “He is also Coroner—you understand.\\nPerhaps you would like to come with me?”\\n\\nWe acquiesced and followed him out of the room. John strode on ahead\\nand I took the opportunity of whispering to Poirot:\\n\\n“There will be an inquest then?”\\n\\nPoirot nodded absently. He seemed absorbed in thought; so much so that\\nmy curiosity was aroused.\\n\\n“What is it? You are not attending to what I say.”\\n\\n“It is true, my friend. I am much worried.”\\n\\n“Why?”\\n\\n“Because Mademoiselle Cynthia does not take sugar in her coffee.”\\n\\n“What? You cannot be serious?”\\n\\n“But I am most serious. Ah, there is something there that I do not\\nunderstand. My instinct was right.”\\n\\n“What instinct?”\\n\\n“The instinct that led me to insist on examining those coffee-cups.\\n_Chut!_ no more now!”\\n\\nWe followed John into his study, and he closed the door behind us.\\n\\nMr. Wells was a pleasant man of middle-age, with keen eyes, and the\\ntypical lawyer’s mouth. John introduced us both, and explained the\\nreason of our presence.\\n\\n“You will understand, Wells,” he added, “that this is all strictly\\nprivate. We are still hoping that there will turn out to be no need for\\ninvestigation of any kind.”\\n\\n“Quite so, quite so,” said Mr. Wells soothingly. “I wish we could have\\nspared you the pain and publicity of an inquest, but of course it’s\\nquite unavoidable in the absence of a doctor’s certificate.”\\n\\n“Yes, I suppose so.”\\n\\n“Clever man, Bauerstein. Great authority on toxicology, I believe.”\\n\\n“Indeed,” said John with a certain stiffness in his manner. Then he\\nadded rather hesitatingly: “Shall we have to appear as witnesses—all of\\nus, I mean?”\\n\\n“You, of course—and ah—er—Mr.—er—Inglethorp.”\\n\\nA slight pause ensued before the lawyer went on in his soothing manner:\\n\\n“Any other evidence will be simply confirmatory, a mere matter of\\nform.”\\n\\n“I see.”\\n\\nA faint expression of relief swept over John’s face. It puzzled me, for\\nI saw no occasion for it.\\n\\n“If you know of nothing to the contrary,” pursued Mr. Wells, “I had\\nthought of Friday. That will give us plenty of time for the doctor’s\\nreport. The post-mortem is to take place to-night, I believe?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“Then that arrangement will suit you?”\\n\\n“Perfectly.”\\n\\n“I need not tell you, my dear Cavendish, how distressed I am at this\\nmost tragic affair.”\\n\\n“Can you give us no help in solving it, monsieur?” interposed Poirot,\\nspeaking for the first time since we had entered the room.\\n\\n“I?”\\n\\n“Yes, we heard that Mrs. Inglethorp wrote to you last night. You should\\nhave received the letter this morning.”\\n\\n“I did, but it contains no information. It is merely a note asking me\\nto call upon her this morning, as she wanted my advice on a matter of\\ngreat importance.”\\n\\n“She gave you no hint as to what that matter might be?”\\n\\n“Unfortunately, no.”\\n\\n“That is a pity,” said John.\\n\\n“A great pity,” agreed Poirot gravely.\\n\\nThere was silence. Poirot remained lost in thought for a few minutes.\\nFinally he turned to the lawyer again.\\n\\n“Mr. Wells, there is one thing I should like to ask you—that is, if it\\nis not against professional etiquette. In the event of Mrs.\\nInglethorp’s death, who would inherit her money?”\\n\\nThe lawyer hesitated a moment, and then replied:\\n\\n“The knowledge will be public property very soon, so if Mr. Cavendish\\ndoes not object——”\\n\\n“Not at all,” interpolated John.\\n\\n“I do not see any reason why I should not answer your question. By her\\nlast will, dated August of last year, after various unimportant\\nlegacies to servants, etc., she gave her entire fortune to her stepson,\\nMr. John Cavendish.”\\n\\n“Was not that—pardon the question, Mr. Cavendish—rather unfair to her\\nother stepson, Mr. Lawrence Cavendish?”\\n\\n“No, I do not think so. You see, under the terms of their father’s\\nwill, while John inherited the property, Lawrence, at his stepmother’s\\ndeath, would come into a considerable sum of money. Mrs. Inglethorp\\nleft her money to her elder stepson, knowing that he would have to keep\\nup Styles. It was, to my mind, a very fair and equitable distribution.”\\n\\nPoirot nodded thoughtfully.\\n\\n“I see. But I am right in saying, am I not, that by your English law\\nthat will was automatically revoked when Mrs. Inglethorp remarried?”\\n\\nMr. Wells bowed his head.\\n\\n“As I was about to proceed, Monsieur Poirot, that document is now null\\nand void.”\\n\\n“_Hein!_” said Poirot. He reflected for a moment, and then asked: “Was\\nMrs. Inglethorp herself aware of that fact?”\\n\\n“I do not know. She may have been.”\\n\\n“She was,” said John unexpectedly. “We were discussing the matter of\\nwills being revoked by marriage only yesterday.”\\n\\n“Ah! One more question, Mr. Wells. You say ‘her last will.’ Had Mrs.\\nInglethorp, then, made several former wills?”\\n\\n“On an average, she made a new will at least once a year,” said Mr.\\nWells imperturbably. “She was given to changing her mind as to her\\ntestamentary dispositions, now benefiting one, now another member of\\nher family.”\\n\\n“Suppose,” suggested Poirot, “that, unknown to you, she had made a new\\nwill in favour of someone who was not, in any sense of the word, a\\nmember of the family—we will say Miss Howard, for instance—would you be\\nsurprised?”\\n\\n“Not in the least.”\\n\\n“Ah!” Poirot seemed to have exhausted his questions.\\n\\nI drew close to him, while John and the lawyer were debating the\\nquestion of going through Mrs. Inglethorp’s papers.\\n\\n“Do you think Mrs. Inglethorp made a will leaving all her money to Miss\\nHoward?” I asked in a low voice, with some curiosity.\\n\\nPoirot smiled.\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“Then why did you ask?”\\n\\n“Hush!”\\n\\nJohn Cavendish had turned to Poirot.\\n\\n“Will you come with us, Monsieur Poirot? We are going through my\\nmother’s papers. Mr. Inglethorp is quite willing to leave it entirely\\nto Mr. Wells and myself.”\\n\\n“Which simplifies matters very much,” murmured the lawyer. “As\\ntechnically, of course, he was entitled——” He did not finish the\\nsentence.\\n\\n“We will look through the desk in the boudoir first,” explained John,\\n“and go up to her bedroom afterwards. She kept her most important\\npapers in a purple despatch-case, which we must look through\\ncarefully.”\\n\\n“Yes,” said the lawyer, “it is quite possible that there may be a later\\nwill than the one in my possession.”\\n\\n“There _is_ a later will.” It was Poirot who spoke.\\n\\n“What?” John and the lawyer looked at him startled.\\n\\n“Or, rather,” pursued my friend imperturbably, “there _was_ one.”\\n\\n“What do you mean—there was one? Where is it now?”\\n\\n“Burnt!”\\n\\n“Burnt?”\\n\\n“Yes. See here.” He took out the charred fragment we had found in the\\ngrate in Mrs. Inglethorp’s room, and handed it to the lawyer with a\\nbrief explanation of when and where he had found it.\\n\\n“But possibly this is an old will?”\\n\\n“I do not think so. In fact I am almost certain that it was made no\\nearlier than yesterday afternoon.”\\n\\n“What?” “Impossible!” broke simultaneously from both men.\\n\\nPoirot turned to John.\\n\\n“If you will allow me to send for your gardener, I will prove it to\\nyou.”\\n\\n“Oh, of course—but I don’t see——”\\n\\nPoirot raised his hand.\\n\\n“Do as I ask you. Afterwards you shall question as much as you please.”\\n\\n“Very well.” He rang the bell.\\n\\nDorcas answered it in due course.\\n\\n“Dorcas, will you tell Manning to come round and speak to me here.”\\n\\n“Yes, sir.”\\n\\nDorcas withdrew.\\n\\nWe waited in a tense silence. Poirot alone seemed perfectly at his\\nease, and dusted a forgotten corner of the bookcase.\\n\\nThe clumping of hobnailed boots on the gravel outside proclaimed the\\napproach of Manning. John looked questioningly at Poirot. The latter\\nnodded.\\n\\n“Come inside, Manning,” said John, “I want to speak to you.”\\n\\nManning came slowly and hesitatingly through the French window, and\\nstood as near it as he could. He held his cap in his hands, twisting it\\nvery carefully round and round. His back was much bent, though he was\\nprobably not as old as he looked, but his eyes were sharp and\\nintelligent, and belied his slow and rather cautious speech.\\n\\n“Manning,” said John, “this gentleman will put some questions to you\\nwhich I want you to answer.”\\n\\n“Yessir,” mumbled Manning.\\n\\nPoirot stepped forward briskly. Manning’s eye swept over him with a\\nfaint contempt.\\n\\n“You were planting a bed of begonias round by the south side of the\\nhouse yesterday afternoon, were you not, Manning?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir, me and Willum.”\\n\\n“And Mrs. Inglethorp came to the window and called you, did she not?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir, she did.”\\n\\n“Tell me in your own words exactly what happened after that.”\\n\\n“Well, sir, nothing much. She just told Willum to go on his bicycle\\ndown to the village, and bring back a form of will, or such-like—I\\ndon’t know what exactly—she wrote it down for him.”\\n\\n“Well?”\\n\\n“Well, he did, sir.”\\n\\n“And what happened next?”\\n\\n“We went on with the begonias, sir.”\\n\\n“Did not Mrs. Inglethorp call you again?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir, both me and Willum, she called.”\\n\\n“And then?”\\n\\n“She made us come right in, and sign our names at the bottom of a long\\npaper—under where she’d signed.”\\n\\n“Did you see anything of what was written above her signature?” asked\\nPoirot sharply.\\n\\n“No, sir, there was a bit of blotting paper over that part.”\\n\\n“And you signed where she told you?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir, first me and then Willum.”\\n\\n“What did she do with it afterwards?”\\n\\n“Well, sir, she slipped it into a long envelope, and put it inside a\\nsort of purple box that was standing on the desk.”\\n\\n“What time was it when she first called you?”\\n\\n“About four, I should say, sir.”\\n\\n“Not earlier? Couldn’t it have been about half-past three?”\\n\\n“No, I shouldn’t say so, sir. It would be more likely to be a bit after\\nfour—not before it.”\\n\\n“Thank you, Manning, that will do,” said Poirot pleasantly.\\n\\nThe gardener glanced at his master, who nodded, whereupon Manning\\nlifted a finger to his forehead with a low mumble, and backed\\ncautiously out of the window.\\n\\nWe all looked at each other.\\n\\n“Good heavens!” murmured John. “What an extraordinary coincidence.”\\n\\n“How—a coincidence?”\\n\\n“That my mother should have made a will on the very day of her death!”\\n\\nMr. Wells cleared his throat and remarked drily:\\n\\n“Are you so sure it is a coincidence, Cavendish?”\\n\\n“What do you mean?”\\n\\n“Your mother, you tell me, had a violent quarrel with—someone yesterday\\nafternoon——”\\n\\n“What do you mean?” cried John again. There was a tremor in his voice,\\nand he had gone very pale.\\n\\n“In consequence of that quarrel, your mother very suddenly and\\nhurriedly makes a new will. The contents of that will we shall never\\nknow. She told no one of its provisions. This morning, no doubt, she\\nwould have consulted me on the subject—but she had no chance. The will\\ndisappears, and she takes its secret with her to her grave. Cavendish,\\nI much fear there is no coincidence there. Monsieur Poirot, I am sure\\nyou agree with me that the facts are very suggestive.”\\n\\n“Suggestive, or not,” interrupted John, “we are most grateful to\\nMonsieur Poirot for elucidating the matter. But for him, we should\\nnever have known of this will. I suppose, I may not ask you, monsieur,\\nwhat first led you to suspect the fact?”\\n\\nPoirot smiled and answered:\\n\\n“A scribbled over old envelope, and a freshly planted bed of begonias.”\\n\\nJohn, I think, would have pressed his questions further, but at that\\nmoment the loud purr of a motor was audible, and we all turned to the\\nwindow as it swept past.\\n\\n“Evie!” cried John. “Excuse me, Wells.” He went hurriedly out into the\\nhall.\\n\\nPoirot looked inquiringly at me.\\n\\n“Miss Howard,” I explained.\\n\\n“Ah, I am glad she has come. There is a woman with a head and a heart\\ntoo, Hastings. Though the good God gave her no beauty!”\\n\\nI followed John’s example, and went out into the hall, where Miss\\nHoward was endeavouring to extricate herself from the voluminous mass\\nof veils that enveloped her head. As her eyes fell on me, a sudden pang\\nof guilt shot through me. This was the woman who had warned me so\\nearnestly, and to whose warning I had, alas, paid no heed! How soon,\\nand how contemptuously, I had dismissed it from my mind. Now that she\\nhad been proved justified in so tragic a manner, I felt ashamed. She\\nhad known Alfred Inglethorp only too well. I wondered whether, if she\\nhad remained at Styles, the tragedy would have taken place, or would\\nthe man have feared her watchful eyes?\\n\\nI was relieved when she shook me by the hand, with her well remembered\\npainful grip. The eyes that met mine were sad, but not reproachful;\\nthat she had been crying bitterly, I could tell by the redness of her\\neyelids, but her manner was unchanged from its old gruffness.\\n\\n“Started the moment I got the wire. Just come off night duty. Hired\\ncar. Quickest way to get here.”\\n\\n“Have you had anything to eat this morning, Evie?” asked John.\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“I thought not. Come along, breakfast’s not cleared away yet, and\\nthey’ll make you some fresh tea.” He turned to me. “Look after her,\\nHastings, will you? Wells is waiting for me. Oh, here’s Monsieur\\nPoirot. He’s helping us, you know, Evie.”\\n\\nMiss Howard shook hands with Poirot, but glanced suspiciously over her\\nshoulder at John.\\n\\n“What do you mean—helping us?”\\n\\n“Helping us to investigate.”\\n\\n“Nothing to investigate. Have they taken him to prison yet?”\\n\\n“Taken who to prison?”\\n\\n“Who? Alfred Inglethorp, of course!”\\n\\n“My dear Evie, do be careful. Lawrence is of the opinion that my mother\\ndied from heart seizure.”\\n\\n“More fool, Lawrence!” retorted Miss Howard. “Of course Alfred\\nInglethorp murdered poor Emily—as I always told you he would.”\\n\\n“My dear Evie, don’t shout so. Whatever we may think or suspect, it is\\nbetter to say as little as possible for the present. The inquest isn’t\\nuntil Friday.”\\n\\n“Not until fiddlesticks!” The snort Miss Howard gave was truly\\nmagnificent. “You’re all off your heads. The man will be out of the\\ncountry by then. If he’s any sense, he won’t stay here tamely and wait\\nto be hanged.”\\n\\nJohn Cavendish looked at her helplessly.\\n\\n“I know what it is,” she accused him, “you’ve been listening to the\\ndoctors. Never should. What do they know? Nothing at all—or just enough\\nto make them dangerous. I ought to know—my own father was a doctor.\\nThat little Wilkins is about the greatest fool that even I have ever\\nseen. Heart seizure! Sort of thing he would say. Anyone with any sense\\ncould see at once that her husband had poisoned her. I always said he’d\\nmurder her in her bed, poor soul. Now he’s done it. And all you can do\\nis to murmur silly things about ‘heart seizure’ and ‘inquest on\\nFriday.’ You ought to be ashamed of yourself, John Cavendish.”\\n\\n“What do you want me to do?” asked John, unable to help a faint smile.\\n“Dash it all, Evie, I can’t haul him down to the local police station\\nby the scruff of his neck.”\\n\\n“Well, you might do something. Find out how he did it. He’s a crafty\\nbeggar. Dare say he soaked fly papers. Ask cook if she’s missed any.”\\n\\nIt occurred to me very forcibly at that moment that to harbour Miss\\nHoward and Alfred Inglethorp under the same roof, and keep the peace\\nbetween them, was likely to prove a Herculean task, and I did not envy\\nJohn. I could see by the expression of his face that he fully\\nappreciated the difficulty of the position. For the moment, he sought\\nrefuge in retreat, and left the room precipitately.\\n\\nDorcas brought in fresh tea. As she left the room, Poirot came over\\nfrom the window where he had been standing, and sat down facing Miss\\nHoward.\\n\\n“Mademoiselle,” he said gravely, “I want to ask you something.”\\n\\n“Ask away,” said the lady, eyeing him with some disfavour.\\n\\n“I want to be able to count upon your help.”\\n\\n“I’ll help you to hang Alfred with pleasure,” she replied gruffly.\\n“Hanging’s too good for him. Ought to be drawn and quartered, like in\\ngood old times.”\\n\\n“We are at one then,” said Poirot, “for I, too, want to hang the\\ncriminal.”\\n\\n“Alfred Inglethorp?”\\n\\n“Him, or another.”\\n\\n“No question of another. Poor Emily was never murdered until _he_ came\\nalong. I don’t say she wasn’t surrounded by sharks—she was. But it was\\nonly her purse they were after. Her life was safe enough. But along\\ncomes Mr. Alfred Inglethorp—and within two months—hey presto!”\\n\\n“Believe me, Miss Howard,” said Poirot very earnestly, “if Mr.\\nInglethorp is the man, he shall not escape me. On my honour, I will\\nhang him as high as Haman!”\\n\\n“That’s better,” said Miss Howard more enthusiastically.\\n\\n“But I must ask you to trust me. Now your help may be very valuable to\\nme. I will tell you why. Because, in all this house of mourning, yours\\nare the only eyes that have wept.”\\n\\nMiss Howard blinked, and a new note crept into the gruffness of her\\nvoice.\\n\\n“If you mean that I was fond of her—yes, I was. You know, Emily was a\\nselfish old woman in her way. She was very generous, but she always\\nwanted a return. She never let people forget what she had done for\\nthem—and, that way she missed love. Don’t think she ever realized it,\\nthough, or felt the lack of it. Hope not, anyway. I was on a different\\nfooting. I took my stand from the first. ‘So many pounds a year I’m\\nworth to you. Well and good. But not a penny piece besides—not a pair\\nof gloves, nor a theatre ticket.’ She didn’t understand—was very\\noffended sometimes. Said I was foolishly proud. It wasn’t that—but I\\ncouldn’t explain. Anyway, I kept my self-respect. And so, out of the\\nwhole bunch, I was the only one who could allow myself to be fond of\\nher. I watched over her. I guarded her from the lot of them, and then a\\nglib-tongued scoundrel comes along, and pooh! all my years of devotion\\ngo for nothing.”\\n\\nPoirot nodded sympathetically.\\n\\n“I understand, mademoiselle, I understand all you feel. It is most\\nnatural. You think that we are lukewarm—that we lack fire and\\nenergy—but trust me, it is not so.”\\n\\nJohn stuck his head in at this juncture, and invited us both to come up\\nto Mrs. Inglethorp’s room, as he and Mr. Wells had finished looking\\nthrough the desk in the boudoir.\\n\\nAs we went up the stairs, John looked back to the dining-room door, and\\nlowered his voice confidentially:\\n\\n“Look here, what’s going to happen when these two meet?”\\n\\nI shook my head helplessly.\\n\\n“I’ve told Mary to keep them apart if she can.”\\n\\n“Will she be able to do so?”\\n\\n“The Lord only knows. There’s one thing, Inglethorp himself won’t be\\ntoo keen on meeting her.”\\n\\n“You’ve got the keys still, haven’t you, Poirot?” I asked, as we\\nreached the door of the locked room.\\n\\nTaking the keys from Poirot, John unlocked it, and we all passed in.\\nThe lawyer went straight to the desk, and John followed him.\\n\\n“My mother kept most of her important papers in this despatch-case, I\\nbelieve,” he said.\\n\\nPoirot drew out the small bunch of keys.\\n\\n“Permit me. I locked it, out of precaution, this morning.”\\n\\n“But it’s not locked now.”\\n\\n“Impossible!”\\n\\n“See.” And John lifted the lid as he spoke.\\n\\n“_Milles tonnerres!_” cried Poirot, dumbfounded. “And I—who have both\\nthe keys in my pocket!” He flung himself upon the case. Suddenly he\\nstiffened. “_Eh voilà une affaire!_ This lock has been forced.”\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\nPoirot laid down the case again.\\n\\n“But who forced it? Why should they? When? But the door was locked?”\\nThese exclamations burst from us disjointedly.\\n\\nPoirot answered them categorically—almost mechanically.\\n\\n“Who? That is the question. Why? Ah, if I only knew. When? Since I was\\nhere an hour ago. As to the door being locked, it is a very ordinary\\nlock. Probably any other of the doorkeys in this passage would fit it.”\\n\\nWe stared at one another blankly. Poirot had walked over to the\\nmantelpiece. He was outwardly calm, but I noticed his hands, which from\\nlong force of habit were mechanically straightening the spill vases on\\nthe mantelpiece, were shaking violently.\\n\\n“See here, it was like this,” he said at last. “There was something in\\nthat case—some piece of evidence, slight in itself perhaps, but still\\nenough of a clue to connect the murderer with the crime. It was vital\\nto him that it should be destroyed before it was discovered and its\\nsignificance appreciated. Therefore, he took the risk, the great risk,\\nof coming in here. Finding the case locked, he was obliged to force it,\\nthus betraying his presence. For him to take that risk, it must have\\nbeen something of great importance.”\\n\\n“But what was it?”\\n\\n“Ah!” cried Poirot, with a gesture of anger. “That, I do not know! A\\ndocument of some kind, without doubt, possibly the scrap of paper\\nDorcas saw in her hand yesterday afternoon. And I—” his anger burst\\nforth freely—“miserable animal that I am! I guessed nothing! I have\\nbehaved like an imbecile! I should never have left that case here. I\\nshould have carried it away with me. Ah, triple pig! And now it is\\ngone. It is destroyed—but is it destroyed? Is there not yet a chance—we\\nmust leave no stone unturned—”\\n\\nHe rushed like a madman from the room, and I followed him as soon as I\\nhad sufficiently recovered my wits. But, by the time I had reached the\\ntop of the stairs, he was out of sight.\\n\\nMary Cavendish was standing where the staircase branched, staring down\\ninto the hall in the direction in which he had disappeared.\\n\\n“What has happened to your extraordinary little friend, Mr. Hastings?\\nHe has just rushed past me like a mad bull.”\\n\\n“He’s rather upset about something,” I remarked feebly. I really did\\nnot know how much Poirot would wish me to disclose. As I saw a faint\\nsmile gather on Mrs. Cavendish’s expressive mouth, I endeavoured to try\\nand turn the conversation by saying: “They haven’t met yet, have they?”\\n\\n“Who?”\\n\\n“Mr. Inglethorp and Miss Howard.”\\n\\nShe looked at me in rather a disconcerting manner.\\n\\n“Do you think it would be such a disaster if they did meet?”\\n\\n“Well, don’t you?” I said, rather taken aback.\\n\\n“No.” She was smiling in her quiet way. “I should like to see a good\\nflare up. It would clear the air. At present we are all thinking so\\nmuch, and saying so little.”\\n\\n“John doesn’t think so,” I remarked. “He’s anxious to keep them apart.”\\n\\n“Oh, John!”\\n\\nSomething in her tone fired me, and I blurted out:\\n\\n“Old John’s an awfully good sort.”\\n\\nShe studied me curiously for a minute or two, and then said, to my\\ngreat surprise:\\n\\n“You are loyal to your friend. I like you for that.”\\n\\n“Aren’t you my friend too?”\\n\\n“I am a very bad friend.”\\n\\n“Why do you say that?”\\n\\n“Because it is true. I am charming to my friends one day, and forget\\nall about them the next.”\\n\\nI don’t know what impelled me, but I was nettled, and I said foolishly\\nand not in the best of taste:\\n\\n“Yet you seem to be invariably charming to Dr. Bauerstein!”\\n\\nInstantly I regretted my words. Her face stiffened. I had the\\nimpression of a steel curtain coming down and blotting out the real\\nwoman. Without a word, she turned and went swiftly up the stairs,\\nwhilst I stood like an idiot gaping after her.\\n\\nI was recalled to other matters by a frightful row going on below. I\\ncould hear Poirot shouting and expounding. I was vexed to think that my\\ndiplomacy had been in vain. The little man appeared to be taking the\\nwhole house into his confidence, a proceeding of which I, for one,\\ndoubted the wisdom. Once again I could not help regretting that my\\nfriend was so prone to lose his head in moments of excitement. I\\nstepped briskly down the stairs. The sight of me calmed Poirot almost\\nimmediately. I drew him aside.\\n\\n“My dear fellow,” I said, “is this wise? Surely you don’t want the\\nwhole house to know of this occurrence? You are actually playing into\\nthe criminal’s hands.”\\n\\n“You think so, Hastings?”\\n\\n“I am sure of it.”\\n\\n“Well, well, my friend, I will be guided by you.”\\n\\n“Good. Although, unfortunately, it is a little too late now.”\\n\\n“Sure.”\\n\\nHe looked so crestfallen and abashed that I felt quite sorry, though I\\nstill thought my rebuke a just and wise one.\\n\\n“Well,” he said at last, “let us go, _mon ami_.”\\n\\n“You have finished here?”\\n\\n“For the moment, yes. You will walk back with me to the village?”\\n\\n“Willingly.”\\n\\nHe picked up his little suit-case, and we went out through the open\\nwindow in the drawing-room. Cynthia Murdoch was just coming in, and\\nPoirot stood aside to let her pass.\\n\\n“Excuse me, mademoiselle, one minute.”\\n\\n“Yes?” she turned inquiringly.\\n\\n“Did you ever make up Mrs. Inglethorp’s medicines?”\\n\\nA slight flush rose in her face, as she answered rather constrainedly:\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“Only her powders?”\\n\\nThe flush deepened as Cynthia replied:\\n\\n“Oh, yes, I did make up some sleeping powders for her once.”\\n\\n“These?”\\n\\nPoirot produced the empty box which had contained powders.\\n\\nShe nodded.\\n\\n“Can you tell me what they were? Sulphonal? Veronal?”\\n\\n“No, they were bromide powders.”\\n\\n“Ah! Thank you, mademoiselle; good morning.”\\n\\nAs we walked briskly away from the house, I glanced at him more than\\nonce. I had often before noticed that, if anything excited him, his\\neyes turned green like a cat’s. They were shining like emeralds now.\\n\\n“My friend,” he broke out at last, “I have a little idea, a very\\nstrange, and probably utterly impossible idea. And yet—it fits in.”\\n\\nI shrugged my shoulders. I privately thought that Poirot was rather too\\nmuch given to these fantastic ideas. In this case, surely, the truth\\nwas only too plain and apparent.\\n\\n“So that is the explanation of the blank label on the box,” I remarked.\\n“Very simple, as you said. I really wonder that I did not think of it\\nmyself.”\\n\\nPoirot did not appear to be listening to me.\\n\\n“They have made one more discovery, _là-bas_,” he observed, jerking his\\nthumb over his shoulder in the direction of Styles. “Mr. Wells told me\\nas we were going upstairs.”\\n\\n“What was it?”\\n\\n“Locked up in the desk in the boudoir, they found a will of Mrs.\\nInglethorp’s, dated before her marriage, leaving her fortune to Alfred\\nInglethorp. It must have been made just at the time they were engaged.\\nIt came quite as a surprise to Wells—and to John Cavendish also. It was\\nwritten on one of those printed will forms, and witnessed by two of the\\nservants—not Dorcas.”\\n\\n“Did Mr. Inglethorp know of it?”\\n\\n“He says not.”\\n\\n“One might take that with a grain of salt,” I remarked sceptically.\\n“All these wills are very confusing. Tell me, how did those scribbled\\nwords on the envelope help you to discover that a will was made\\nyesterday afternoon?”\\n\\nPoirot smiled.\\n\\n“_Mon ami_, have you ever, when writing a letter, been arrested by the\\nfact that you did not know how to spell a certain word?”\\n\\n“Yes, often. I suppose everyone has.”\\n\\n“Exactly. And have you not, in such a case, tried the word once or\\ntwice on the edge of the blotting-paper, or a spare scrap of paper, to\\nsee if it looked right? Well, that is what Mrs. Inglethorp did. You\\nwill notice that the word ‘possessed’ is spelt first with one ‘s’ and\\nsubsequently with two—correctly. To make sure, she had further tried it\\nin a sentence, thus: ‘I am possessed.’ Now, what did that tell me? It\\ntold me that Mrs. Inglethorp had been writing the word ‘possessed’ that\\nafternoon, and, having the fragment of paper found in the grate fresh\\nin my mind, the possibility of a will—(a document almost certain to\\ncontain that word)—occurred to me at once. This possibility was\\nconfirmed by a further circumstance. In the general confusion, the\\nboudoir had not been swept that morning, and near the desk were several\\ntraces of brown mould and earth. The weather had been perfectly fine\\nfor some days, and no ordinary boots would have left such a heavy\\ndeposit.\\n\\n“I strolled to the window, and saw at once that the begonia beds had\\nbeen newly planted. The mould in the beds was exactly similar to that\\non the floor of the boudoir, and also I learnt from you that they _had_\\nbeen planted yesterday afternoon. I was now sure that one, or possibly\\nboth of the gardeners—for there were two sets of footprints in the\\nbed—had entered the boudoir, for if Mrs. Inglethorp had merely wished\\nto speak to them she would in all probability have stood at the window,\\nand they would not have come into the room at all. I was now quite\\nconvinced that she had made a fresh will, and had called the two\\ngardeners in to witness her signature. Events proved that I was right\\nin my supposition.”\\n\\n“That was very ingenious,” I could not help admitting. “I must confess\\nthat the conclusions I drew from those few scribbled words were quite\\nerroneous.”\\n\\nHe smiled.\\n\\n“You gave too much rein to your imagination. Imagination is a good\\nservant, and a bad master. The simplest explanation is always the most\\nlikely.”\\n\\n“Another point—how did you know that the key of the despatch-case had\\nbeen lost?”\\n\\n“I did not know it. It was a guess that turned out to be correct. You\\nobserved that it had a piece of twisted wire through the handle. That\\nsuggested to me at once that it had possibly been wrenched off a flimsy\\nkey-ring. Now, if it had been lost and recovered, Mrs. Inglethorp would\\nat once have replaced it on her bunch; but on her bunch I found what\\nwas obviously the duplicate key, very new and bright, which led me to\\nthe hypothesis that somebody else had inserted the original key in the\\nlock of the despatch-case.”\\n\\n“Yes,” I said, “Alfred Inglethorp, without doubt.”\\n\\nPoirot looked at me curiously.\\n\\n“You are very sure of his guilt?”\\n\\n“Well, naturally. Every fresh circumstance seems to establish it more\\nclearly.”\\n\\n“On the contrary,” said Poirot quietly, “there are several points in\\nhis favour.”\\n\\n“Oh, come now!”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“I see only one.”\\n\\n“And that?”\\n\\n“That he was not in the house last night.”\\n\\n“‘Bad shot!’ as you English say! You have chosen the one point that to\\nmy mind tells against him.”\\n\\n“How is that?”\\n\\n“Because if Mr. Inglethorp knew that his wife would be poisoned last\\nnight, he would certainly have arranged to be away from the house. His\\nexcuse was an obviously trumped up one. That leaves us two\\npossibilities: either he knew what was going to happen or he had a\\nreason of his own for his absence.”\\n\\n“And that reason?” I asked sceptically.\\n\\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n“How should I know? Discreditable, without doubt. This Mr. Inglethorp,\\nI should say, is somewhat of a scoundrel—but that does not of necessity\\nmake him a murderer.”\\n\\nI shook my head, unconvinced.\\n\\n“We do not agree, eh?” said Poirot. “Well, let us leave it. Time will\\nshow which of us is right. Now let us turn to other aspects of the\\ncase. What do you make of the fact that all the doors of the bedroom\\nwere bolted on the inside?”\\n\\n“Well——” I considered. “One must look at it logically.”\\n\\n“True.”\\n\\n“I should put it this way. The doors _were_ bolted—our own eyes have\\ntold us that—yet the presence of the candle grease on the floor, and\\nthe destruction of the will, prove that during the night someone\\nentered the room. You agree so far?”\\n\\n“Perfectly. Put with admirable clearness. Proceed.”\\n\\n“Well,” I said, encouraged, “as the person who entered did not do so by\\nthe window, nor by miraculous means, it follows that the door must have\\nbeen opened from inside by Mrs. Inglethorp herself. That strengthens\\nthe conviction that the person in question was her husband. She would\\nnaturally open the door to her own husband.”\\n\\nPoirot shook his head.\\n\\n“Why should she? She had bolted the door leading into his room—a most\\nunusual proceeding on her part—she had had a most violent quarrel with\\nhim that very afternoon. No, he was the last person she would admit.”\\n\\n“But you agree with me that the door must have been opened by Mrs.\\nInglethorp herself?”\\n\\n“There is another possibility. She may have forgotten to bolt the door\\ninto the passage when she went to bed, and have got up later, towards\\nmorning, and bolted it then.”\\n\\n“Poirot, is that seriously your opinion?”\\n\\n“No, I do not say it is so, but it might be. Now, to turn to another\\nfeature, what do you make of the scrap of conversation you overheard\\nbetween Mrs. Cavendish and her mother-in-law?”\\n\\n“I had forgotten that,” I said thoughtfully. “That is as enigmatical as\\never. It seems incredible that a woman like Mrs. Cavendish, proud and\\nreticent to the last degree, should interfere so violently in what was\\ncertainly not her affair.”\\n\\n“Precisely. It was an astonishing thing for a woman of her breeding to\\ndo.”\\n\\n“It is certainly curious,” I agreed. “Still, it is unimportant, and\\nneed not be taken into account.”\\n\\nA groan burst from Poirot.\\n\\n“What have I always told you? Everything must be taken into account. If\\nthe fact will not fit the theory—let the theory go.”\\n\\n“Well, we shall see,” I said, nettled.\\n\\n“Yes, we shall see.”\\n\\nWe had reached Leastways Cottage, and Poirot ushered me upstairs to his\\nown room. He offered me one of the tiny Russian cigarettes he himself\\noccasionally smoked. I was amused to notice that he stowed away the\\nused matches most carefully in a little china pot. My momentary\\nannoyance vanished.\\n\\nPoirot had placed our two chairs in front of the open window which\\ncommanded a view of the village street. The fresh air blew in warm and\\npleasant. It was going to be a hot day.\\n\\nSuddenly my attention was arrested by a weedy looking young man rushing\\ndown the street at a great pace. It was the expression on his face that\\nwas extraordinary—a curious mingling of terror and agitation.\\n\\n“Look, Poirot!” I said.\\n\\nHe leant forward.\\n\\n“_Tiens!_” he said. “It is Mr. Mace, from the chemist’s shop. He is\\ncoming here.”\\n\\nThe young man came to a halt before Leastways Cottage, and, after\\nhesitating a moment, pounded vigorously at the door.\\n\\n“A little minute,” cried Poirot from the window. “I come.”\\n\\nMotioning to me to follow him, he ran swiftly down the stairs and\\nopened the door. Mr. Mace began at once.\\n\\n“Oh, Mr. Poirot, I’m sorry for the inconvenience, but I heard that\\nyou’d just come back from the Hall?”\\n\\n“Yes, we have.”\\n\\nThe young man moistened his dry lips. His face was working curiously.\\n\\n“It’s all over the village about old Mrs. Inglethorp dying so suddenly.\\nThey do say—” he lowered his voice cautiously—“that it’s poison?”\\n\\nPoirot’s face remained quite impassive.\\n\\n“Only the doctors can tell us that, Mr. Mace.”\\n\\n“Yes, exactly—of course——” The young man hesitated, and then his\\nagitation was too much for him. He clutched Poirot by the arm, and sank\\nhis voice to a whisper: “Just tell me this, Mr. Poirot, it isn’t—it\\nisn’t strychnine, is it?”\\n\\nI hardly heard what Poirot replied. Something evidently of a\\nnon-committal nature. The young man departed, and as he closed the door\\nPoirot’s eyes met mine.\\n\\n“Yes,” he said, nodding gravely. “He will have evidence to give at the\\ninquest.”\\n\\nWe went slowly upstairs again. I was opening my lips, when Poirot\\nstopped me with a gesture of his hand.\\n\\n“Not now, not now, _mon ami_. I have need of reflection. My mind is in\\nsome disorder—which is not well.”\\n\\nFor about ten minutes he sat in dead silence, perfectly still, except\\nfor several expressive motions of his eyebrows, and all the time his\\neyes grew steadily greener. At last he heaved a deep sigh.\\n\\n“It is well. The bad moment has passed. Now all is arranged and\\nclassified. One must never permit confusion. The case is not clear\\nyet—no. For it is of the most complicated! It puzzles _me_. _Me_,\\nHercule Poirot! There are two facts of significance.”\\n\\n“And what are they?”\\n\\n“The first is the state of the weather yesterday. That is very\\nimportant.”\\n\\n“But it was a glorious day!” I interrupted. “Poirot, you’re pulling my\\nleg!”\\n\\n“Not at all. The thermometer registered 80 degrees in the shade. Do not\\nforget that, my friend. It is the key to the whole riddle!”\\n\\n“And the second point?” I asked.\\n\\n“The important fact that Monsieur Inglethorp wears very peculiar\\nclothes, has a black beard, and uses glasses.”\\n\\n“Poirot, I cannot believe you are serious.”\\n\\n“I am absolutely serious, my friend.”\\n\\n“But this is childish!”\\n\\n“No, it is very momentous.”\\n\\n“And supposing the Coroner’s jury returns a verdict of Wilful Murder\\nagainst Alfred Inglethorp. What becomes of your theories, then?”\\n\\n“They would not be shaken because twelve stupid men had happened to\\nmake a mistake! But that will not occur. For one thing, a country jury\\nis not anxious to take responsibility upon itself, and Mr. Inglethorp\\nstands practically in the position of local squire. Also,” he added\\nplacidly, “_I_ should not allow it!”\\n\\n“_You_ would not allow it?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\nI looked at the extraordinary little man, divided between annoyance and\\namusement. He was so tremendously sure of himself. As though he read my\\nthoughts, he nodded gently.\\n\\n“Oh, yes, _mon ami_, I would do what I say.” He got up and laid his\\nhand on my shoulder. His physiognomy underwent a complete change. Tears\\ncame into his eyes. “In all this, you see, I think of that poor Mrs.\\nInglethorp who is dead. She was not extravagantly loved—no. But she was\\nvery good to us Belgians—I owe her a debt.”\\n\\nI endeavoured to interrupt, but Poirot swept on.\\n\\n“Let me tell you this, Hastings. She would never forgive me if I let\\nAlfred Inglethorp, her husband, be arrested _now_—when a word from me\\ncould save him!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI.\\nTHE INQUEST\\n\\n\\nIn the interval before the inquest, Poirot was unfailing in his\\nactivity. Twice he was closeted with Mr. Wells. He also took long walks\\ninto the country. I rather resented his not taking me into his\\nconfidence, the more so as I could not in the least guess what he was\\ndriving at.\\n\\nIt occurred to me that he might have been making inquiries at Raikes’s\\nfarm; so, finding him out when I called at Leastways Cottage on\\nWednesday evening, I walked over there by the fields, hoping to meet\\nhim. But there was no sign of him, and I hesitated to go right up to\\nthe farm itself. As I walked away, I met an aged rustic, who leered at\\nme cunningly.\\n\\n“You’m from the Hall, bain’t you?” he asked.\\n\\n“Yes. I’m looking for a friend of mine whom I thought might have walked\\nthis way.”\\n\\n“A little chap? As waves his hands when he talks? One of them Belgies\\nfrom the village?”\\n\\n“Yes,” I said eagerly. “He has been here, then?”\\n\\n“Oh, ay, he’s been here, right enough. More’n once too. Friend of\\nyours, is he? Ah, you gentlemen from the Hall—you’m a pretty lot!” And\\nhe leered more jocosely than ever.\\n\\n“Why, do the gentlemen from the Hall come here often?” I asked, as\\ncarelessly as I could.\\n\\nHe winked at me knowingly.\\n\\n“_One_ does, mister. Naming no names, mind. And a very liberal\\ngentleman too! Oh, thank you, sir, I’m sure.”\\n\\nI walked on sharply. Evelyn Howard had been right then, and I\\nexperienced a sharp twinge of disgust, as I thought of Alfred\\nInglethorp’s liberality with another woman’s money. Had that piquant\\ngipsy face been at the bottom of the crime, or was it the baser\\nmainspring of money? Probably a judicious mixture of both.\\n\\nOn one point, Poirot seemed to have a curious obsession. He once or\\ntwice observed to me that he thought Dorcas must have made an error in\\nfixing the time of the quarrel. He suggested to her repeatedly that it\\nwas four-thirty, and not four o’clock when she had heard the voices.\\n\\nBut Dorcas was unshaken. Quite an hour, or even more, had elapsed\\nbetween the time when she had heard the voices and five o’clock, when\\nshe had taken tea to her mistress.\\n\\nThe inquest was held on Friday at the Stylites Arms in the village.\\nPoirot and I sat together, not being required to give evidence.\\n\\nThe preliminaries were gone through. The jury viewed the body, and John\\nCavendish gave evidence of identification.\\n\\nFurther questioned, he described his awakening in the early hours of\\nthe morning, and the circumstances of his mother’s death.\\n\\nThe medical evidence was next taken. There was a breathless hush, and\\nevery eye was fixed on the famous London specialist, who was known to\\nbe one of the greatest authorities of the day on the subject of\\ntoxicology.\\n\\nIn a few brief words, he summed up the result of the post-mortem. Shorn\\nof its medical phraseology and technicalities, it amounted to the fact\\nthat Mrs. Inglethorp had met her death as the result of strychnine\\npoisoning. Judging from the quantity recovered, she must have taken not\\nless than three-quarters of a grain of strychnine, but probably one\\ngrain or slightly over.\\n\\n“Is it possible that she could have swallowed the poison by accident?”\\nasked the Coroner.\\n\\n“I should consider it very unlikely. Strychnine is not used for\\ndomestic purposes, as some poisons are, and there are restrictions\\nplaced on its sale.”\\n\\n“Does anything in your examination lead you to determine how the poison\\nwas administered?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“You arrived at Styles before Dr. Wilkins, I believe?”\\n\\n“That is so. The motor met me just outside the lodge gates, and I\\nhurried there as fast as I could.”\\n\\n“Will you relate to us exactly what happened next?”\\n\\n“I entered Mrs. Inglethorp’s room. She was at that moment in a typical\\ntetanic convulsion. She turned towards me, and gasped out:\\n‘Alfred—Alfred——’”\\n\\n“Could the strychnine have been administered in Mrs. Inglethorp’s\\nafter-dinner coffee which was taken to her by her husband?”\\n\\n“Possibly, but strychnine is a fairly rapid drug in its action. The\\nsymptoms appear from one to two hours after it has been swallowed. It\\nis retarded under certain conditions, none of which, however, appear to\\nhave been present in this case. I presume Mrs. Inglethorp took the\\ncoffee after dinner about eight o’clock, whereas the symptoms did not\\nmanifest themselves until the early hours of the morning, which, on the\\nface of it, points to the drug having been taken much later in the\\nevening.”\\n\\n“Mrs. Inglethorp was in the habit of drinking a cup of cocoa in the\\nmiddle of the night. Could the strychnine have been administered in\\nthat?”\\n\\n“No, I myself took a sample of the cocoa remaining in the saucepan and\\nhad it analysed. There was no strychnine present.”\\n\\nI heard Poirot chuckle softly beside me.\\n\\n“How did you know?” I whispered.\\n\\n“Listen.”\\n\\n“I should say”—the doctor was continuing—“that I would have been\\nconsiderably surprised at any other result.”\\n\\n“Why?”\\n\\n“Simply because strychnine has an unusually bitter taste. It can be\\ndetected in a solution of one in seventy thousand, and can only be\\ndisguised by some strongly flavoured substance. Cocoa would be quite\\npowerless to mask it.”\\n\\nOne of the jury wanted to know if the same objection applied to coffee.\\n\\n“No. Coffee has a bitter taste of its own which would probably cover\\nthe taste of strychnine.”\\n\\n“Then you consider it more likely that the drug was administered in the\\ncoffee, but that for some unknown reason its action was delayed.”\\n\\n“Yes, but, the cup being completely smashed, there is no possibility of\\nanalyzing its contents.”\\n\\nThis concluded Dr. Bauerstein’s evidence. Dr. Wilkins corroborated it\\non all points. Sounded as to the possibility of suicide, he repudiated\\nit utterly. The deceased, he said, suffered from a weak heart, but\\notherwise enjoyed perfect health, and was of a cheerful and\\nwell-balanced disposition. She would be one of the last people to take\\nher own life.\\n\\nLawrence Cavendish was next called. His evidence was quite unimportant,\\nbeing a mere repetition of that of his brother. Just as he was about to\\nstep down, he paused, and said rather hesitatingly:\\n\\n“I should like to make a suggestion if I may?”\\n\\nHe glanced deprecatingly at the Coroner, who replied briskly:\\n\\n“Certainly, Mr. Cavendish, we are here to arrive at the truth of this\\nmatter, and welcome anything that may lead to further elucidation.”\\n\\n“It is just an idea of mine,” explained Lawrence. “Of course I may be\\nquite wrong, but it still seems to me that my mother’s death might be\\naccounted for by natural means.”\\n\\n“How do you make that out, Mr. Cavendish?”\\n\\n“My mother, at the time of her death, and for some time before it, was\\ntaking a tonic containing strychnine.”\\n\\n“Ah!” said the Coroner.\\n\\nThe jury looked up, interested.\\n\\n“I believe,” continued Lawrence, “that there have been cases where the\\ncumulative effect of a drug, administered for some time, has ended by\\ncausing death. Also, is it not possible that she may have taken an\\noverdose of her medicine by accident?”\\n\\n“This is the first we have heard of the deceased taking strychnine at\\nthe time of her death. We are much obliged to you, Mr. Cavendish.”\\n\\nDr. Wilkins was recalled and ridiculed the idea.\\n\\n“What Mr. Cavendish suggests is quite impossible. Any doctor would tell\\nyou the same. Strychnine is, in a certain sense, a cumulative poison,\\nbut it would be quite impossible for it to result in sudden death in\\nthis way. There would have to be a long period of chronic symptoms\\nwhich would at once have attracted my attention. The whole thing is\\nabsurd.”\\n\\n“And the second suggestion? That Mrs. Inglethorp may have inadvertently\\ntaken an overdose?”\\n\\n“Three, or even four doses, would not have resulted in death. Mrs.\\nInglethorp always had an extra large amount of medicine made up at a\\ntime, as she dealt with Coot’s, the Cash Chemists in Tadminster. She\\nwould have had to take very nearly the whole bottle to account for the\\namount of strychnine found at the post-mortem.”\\n\\n“Then you consider that we may dismiss the tonic as not being in any\\nway instrumental in causing her death?”\\n\\n“Certainly. The supposition is ridiculous.”\\n\\nThe same juryman who had interrupted before here suggested that the\\nchemist who made up the medicine might have committed an error.\\n\\n“That, of course, is always possible,” replied the doctor.\\n\\nBut Dorcas, who was the next witness called, dispelled even that\\npossibility. The medicine had not been newly made up. On the contrary,\\nMrs. Inglethorp had taken the last dose on the day of her death.\\n\\nSo the question of the tonic was finally abandoned, and the Coroner\\nproceeded with his task. Having elicited from Dorcas how she had been\\nawakened by the violent ringing of her mistress’s bell, and had\\nsubsequently roused the household, he passed to the subject of the\\nquarrel on the preceding afternoon.\\n\\nDorcas’s evidence on this point was substantially what Poirot and I had\\nalready heard, so I will not repeat it here.\\n\\nThe next witness was Mary Cavendish. She stood very upright, and spoke\\nin a low, clear, and perfectly composed voice. In answer to the\\nCoroner’s question, she told how, her alarm clock having aroused her at\\nfour-thirty as usual, she was dressing, when she was startled by the\\nsound of something heavy falling.\\n\\n“That would have been the table by the bed?” commented the Coroner.\\n\\n“I opened my door,” continued Mary, “and listened. In a few minutes a\\nbell rang violently. Dorcas came running down and woke my husband, and\\nwe all went to my mother-in-law’s room, but it was locked——”\\n\\nThe Coroner interrupted her.\\n\\n“I really do not think we need trouble you further on that point. We\\nknow all that can be known of the subsequent happenings. But I should\\nbe obliged if you would tell us all you overheard of the quarrel the\\nday before.”\\n\\n“I?”\\n\\nThere was a faint insolence in her voice. She raised her hand and\\nadjusted the ruffle of lace at her neck, turning her head a little as\\nshe did so. And quite spontaneously the thought flashed across my mind:\\n“She is gaining time!”\\n\\n“Yes. I understand,” continued the Coroner deliberately, “that you were\\nsitting reading on the bench just outside the long window of the\\nboudoir. That is so, is it not?”\\n\\nThis was news to me and glancing sideways at Poirot, I fancied that it\\nwas news to him as well.\\n\\nThere was the faintest pause, the mere hesitation of a moment, before\\nshe answered:\\n\\n“Yes, that is so.”\\n\\n“And the boudoir window was open, was it not?”\\n\\nSurely her face grew a little paler as she answered:\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“Then you cannot have failed to hear the voices inside, especially as\\nthey were raised in anger. In fact, they would be more audible where\\nyou were than in the hall.”\\n\\n“Possibly.”\\n\\n“Will you repeat to us what you overheard of the quarrel?”\\n\\n“I really do not remember hearing anything.”\\n\\n“Do you mean to say you did not hear voices?”\\n\\n“Oh, yes, I heard the voices, but I did not hear what they said.” A\\nfaint spot of colour came into her cheek. “I am not in the habit of\\nlistening to private conversations.”\\n\\nThe Coroner persisted.\\n\\n“And you remember nothing at all? _Nothing_, Mrs. Cavendish? Not one\\nstray word or phrase to make you realize that it _was_ a private\\nconversation?”\\n\\nShe paused, and seemed to reflect, still outwardly as calm as ever.\\n\\n“Yes; I remember. Mrs. Inglethorp said something—I do not remember\\nexactly what—about causing scandal between husband and wife.”\\n\\n“Ah!” the Coroner leant back satisfied. “That corresponds with what\\nDorcas heard. But excuse me, Mrs. Cavendish, although you realized it\\nwas a private conversation, you did not move away? You remained where\\nyou were?”\\n\\nI caught the momentary gleam of her tawny eyes as she raised them. I\\nfelt certain that at that moment she would willingly have torn the\\nlittle lawyer, with his insinuations, into pieces, but she replied\\nquietly enough:\\n\\n“No. I was very comfortable where I was. I fixed my mind on my book.”\\n\\n“And that is all you can tell us?”\\n\\n“That is all.”\\n\\nThe examination was over, though I doubted if the Coroner was entirely\\nsatisfied with it. I think he suspected that Mary Cavendish could tell\\nmore if she chose.\\n\\nAmy Hill, shop assistant, was next called, and deposed to having sold a\\nwill form on the afternoon of the 17th to William Earl, under-gardener\\nat Styles.\\n\\nWilliam Earl and Manning succeeded her, and testified to witnessing a\\ndocument. Manning fixed the time at about four-thirty, William was of\\nthe opinion that it was rather earlier.\\n\\nCynthia Murdoch came next. She had, however, little to tell. She had\\nknown nothing of the tragedy, until awakened by Mrs. Cavendish.\\n\\n“You did not hear the table fall?”\\n\\n“No. I was fast asleep.”\\n\\nThe Coroner smiled.\\n\\n“A good conscience makes a sound sleeper,” he observed. “Thank you,\\nMiss Murdoch, that is all.”\\n\\n“Miss Howard.”\\n\\nMiss Howard produced the letter written to her by Mrs. Inglethorp on\\nthe evening of the 17th. Poirot and I had, of course already seen it.\\nIt added nothing to our knowledge of the tragedy. The following is a\\nfacsimile:\\n\\nSTYLES COURT\\nESSEX\\nhand written note:\\n\\n     July 17th\\n     My dear Evelyn\\n     Can we not bury\\n     the hachet? I have\\n     found it hard to forgive\\n     the things you said\\n     against my dear husband\\n     but I am an old woman\\n     & very fond of you\\n     Yours affectionately,\\n    Emily Inglethorpe\\n\\n\\nIt was handed to the jury who scrutinized it attentively.\\n\\n“I fear it does not help us much,” said the Coroner, with a sigh.\\n“There is no mention of any of the events of that afternoon.”\\n\\n“Plain as a pikestaff to me,” said Miss Howard shortly. “It shows\\nclearly enough that my poor old friend had just found out she’d been\\nmade a fool of!”\\n\\n“It says nothing of the kind in the letter,” the Coroner pointed out.\\n\\n“No, because Emily never could bear to put herself in the wrong. But\\n_I_ know her. She wanted me back. But she wasn’t going to own that I’d\\nbeen right. She went round about. Most people do. Don’t believe in it\\nmyself.”\\n\\nMr. Wells smiled faintly. So, I noticed, did several of the jury. Miss\\nHoward was obviously quite a public character.\\n\\n“Anyway, all this tomfoolery is a great waste of time,” continued the\\nlady, glancing up and down the jury disparagingly. “Talk—talk—talk!\\nWhen all the time we know perfectly well——”\\n\\nThe Coroner interrupted her in an agony of apprehension:\\n\\n“Thank you, Miss Howard, that is all.”\\n\\nI fancy he breathed a sigh of relief when she complied.\\n\\nThen came the sensation of the day. The Coroner called Albert Mace,\\nchemist’s assistant.\\n\\nIt was our agitated young man of the pale face. In answer to the\\nCoroner’s questions, he explained that he was a qualified pharmacist,\\nbut had only recently come to this particular shop, as the assistant\\nformerly there had just been called up for the army.\\n\\nThese preliminaries completed, the Coroner proceeded to business.\\n\\n“Mr. Mace, have you lately sold strychnine to any unauthorized person?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir.”\\n\\n“When was this?”\\n\\n“Last Monday night.”\\n\\n“Monday? Not Tuesday?”\\n\\n“No, sir, Monday, the 16th.”\\n\\n“Will you tell us to whom you sold it?”\\n\\nYou could have heard a pin drop.\\n\\n“Yes, sir. It was to Mr. Inglethorp.”\\n\\nEvery eye turned simultaneously to where Alfred Inglethorp was sitting,\\nimpassive and wooden. He started slightly, as the damning words fell\\nfrom the young man’s lips. I half thought he was going to rise from his\\nchair, but he remained seated, although a remarkably well acted\\nexpression of astonishment rose on his face.\\n\\n“You are sure of what you say?” asked the Coroner sternly.\\n\\n“Quite sure, sir.”\\n\\n“Are you in the habit of selling strychnine indiscriminately over the\\ncounter?”\\n\\nThe wretched young man wilted visibly under the Coroner’s frown.\\n\\n“Oh, no, sir—of course not. But, seeing it was Mr. Inglethorp of the\\nHall, I thought there was no harm in it. He said it was to poison a\\ndog.”\\n\\nInwardly I sympathized. It was only human nature to endeavour to please\\n“The Hall”—especially when it might result in custom being transferred\\nfrom Coot’s to the local establishment.\\n\\n“Is it not customary for anyone purchasing poison to sign a book?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir, Mr. Inglethorp did so.”\\n\\n“Have you got the book here?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir.”\\n\\nIt was produced; and, with a few words of stern censure, the Coroner\\ndismissed the wretched Mr. Mace.\\n\\nThen, amidst a breathless silence, Alfred Inglethorp was called. Did he\\nrealize, I wondered, how closely the halter was being drawn around his\\nneck?\\n\\nThe Coroner went straight to the point.\\n\\n“On Monday evening last, did you purchase strychnine for the purpose of\\npoisoning a dog?”\\n\\nInglethorp replied with perfect calmness:\\n\\n“No, I did not. There is no dog at Styles, except an outdoor sheepdog,\\nwhich is in perfect health.”\\n\\n“You deny absolutely having purchased strychnine from Albert Mace on\\nMonday last?”\\n\\n“I do.”\\n\\n“Do you also deny _this_?”\\n\\nThe Coroner handed him the register in which his signature was\\ninscribed.\\n\\n“Certainly I do. The hand-writing is quite different from mine. I will\\nshow you.”\\n\\nHe took an old envelope out of his pocket, and wrote his name on it,\\nhanding it to the jury. It was certainly utterly dissimilar.\\n\\n“Then what is your explanation of Mr. Mace’s statement?”\\n\\nAlfred Inglethorp replied imperturbably:\\n\\n“Mr. Mace must have been mistaken.”\\n\\nThe Coroner hesitated for a moment, and then said:\\n\\n“Mr. Inglethorp, as a mere matter of form, would you mind telling us\\nwhere you were on the evening of Monday, July 16th?”\\n\\n“Really—I cannot remember.”\\n\\n“That is absurd, Mr. Inglethorp,” said the Coroner sharply. “Think\\nagain.”\\n\\nInglethorp shook his head.\\n\\n“I cannot tell you. I have an idea that I was out walking.”\\n\\n“In what direction?”\\n\\n“I really can’t remember.”\\n\\nThe Coroner’s face grew graver.\\n\\n“Were you in company with anyone?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“Did you meet anyone on your walk?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“That is a pity,” said the Coroner dryly. “I am to take it then that\\nyou decline to say where you were at the time that Mr. Mace positively\\nrecognized you as entering the shop to purchase strychnine?”\\n\\n“If you like to take it that way, yes.”\\n\\n“Be careful, Mr. Inglethorp.”\\n\\nPoirot was fidgeting nervously.\\n\\n“_Sacré!_” he murmured. “Does this imbecile of a man _want_ to be\\narrested?”\\n\\nInglethorp was indeed creating a bad impression. His futile denials\\nwould not have convinced a child. The Coroner, however, passed briskly\\nto the next point, and Poirot drew a deep breath of relief.\\n\\n“You had a discussion with your wife on Tuesday afternoon?”\\n\\n“Pardon me,” interrupted Alfred Inglethorp, “you have been misinformed.\\nI had no quarrel with my dear wife. The whole story is absolutely\\nuntrue. I was absent from the house the entire afternoon.”\\n\\n“Have you anyone who can testify to that?”\\n\\n“You have my word,” said Inglethorp haughtily.\\n\\nThe Coroner did not trouble to reply.\\n\\n“There are two witnesses who will swear to having heard your\\ndisagreement with Mrs. Inglethorp.”\\n\\n“Those witnesses were mistaken.”\\n\\nI was puzzled. The man spoke with such quiet assurance that I was\\nstaggered. I looked at Poirot. There was an expression of exultation on\\nhis face which I could not understand. Was he at last convinced of\\nAlfred Inglethorp’s guilt?\\n\\n“Mr. Inglethorp,” said the Coroner, “you have heard your wife’s dying\\nwords repeated here. Can you explain them in any way?”\\n\\n“Certainly I can.”\\n\\n“You can?”\\n\\n“It seems to me very simple. The room was dimly lighted. Dr. Bauerstein\\nis much of my height and build, and, like me, wears a beard. In the dim\\nlight, and suffering as she was, my poor wife mistook him for me.”\\n\\n“Ah!” murmured Poirot to himself. “But it is an idea, that!”\\n\\n“You think it is true?” I whispered.\\n\\n“I do not say that. But it is truly an ingenious supposition.”\\n\\n“You read my wife’s last words as an accusation”—Inglethorp was\\ncontinuing—“they were, on the contrary, an appeal to me.”\\n\\nThe Coroner reflected a moment, then he said:\\n\\n“I believe, Mr. Inglethorp, that you yourself poured out the coffee,\\nand took it to your wife that evening?”\\n\\n“I poured it out, yes. But I did not take it to her. I meant to do so,\\nbut I was told that a friend was at the hall door, so I laid down the\\ncoffee on the hall table. When I came through the hall again a few\\nminutes later, it was gone.”\\n\\nThis statement might, or might not, be true, but it did not seem to me\\nto improve matters much for Inglethorp. In any case, he had had ample\\ntime to introduce the poison.\\n\\nAt that point, Poirot nudged me gently, indicating two men who were\\nsitting together near the door. One was a little, sharp, dark,\\nferret-faced man, the other was tall and fair.\\n\\nI questioned Poirot mutely. He put his lips to my ear.\\n\\n“Do you know who that little man is?”\\n\\nI shook my head.\\n\\n“That is Detective Inspector James Japp of Scotland Yard—Jimmy Japp.\\nThe other man is from Scotland Yard too. Things are moving quickly, my\\nfriend.”\\n\\nI stared at the two men intently. There was certainly nothing of the\\npoliceman about them. I should never have suspected them of being\\nofficial personages.\\n\\nI was still staring, when I was startled and recalled by the verdict\\nbeing given:\\n\\n“Wilful Murder against some person or persons unknown.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII.\\nPOIROT PAYS HIS DEBTS\\n\\n\\nAs we came out of the Stylites Arms, Poirot drew me aside by a gentle\\npressure of the arm. I understood his object. He was waiting for the\\nScotland Yard men.\\n\\nIn a few moments, they emerged, and Poirot at once stepped forward, and\\naccosted the shorter of the two.\\n\\n“I fear you do not remember me, Inspector Japp.”\\n\\n“Why, if it isn’t Mr. Poirot!” cried the Inspector. He turned to the\\nother man. “You’ve heard me speak of Mr. Poirot? It was in 1904 he and\\nI worked together—the Abercrombie forgery case—you remember, he was run\\ndown in Brussels. Ah, those were great days, moosier. Then, do you\\nremember ‘Baron’ Altara? There was a pretty rogue for you! He eluded\\nthe clutches of half the police in Europe. But we nailed him in\\nAntwerp—thanks to Mr. Poirot here.”\\n\\nAs these friendly reminiscences were being indulged in, I drew nearer,\\nand was introduced to Detective-Inspector Japp, who, in his turn,\\nintroduced us both to his companion, Superintendent Summerhaye.\\n\\n“I need hardly ask what you are doing here, gentlemen,” remarked\\nPoirot.\\n\\nJapp closed one eye knowingly.\\n\\n“No, indeed. Pretty clear case I should say.”\\n\\nBut Poirot answered gravely:\\n\\n“There I differ from you.”\\n\\n“Oh, come!” said Summerhaye, opening his lips for the first time.\\n“Surely the whole thing is clear as daylight. The man’s caught\\nred-handed. How he could be such a fool beats me!”\\n\\nBut Japp was looking attentively at Poirot.\\n\\n“Hold your fire, Summerhaye,” he remarked jocularly. “Me and Moosier\\nhere have met before—and there’s no man’s judgment I’d sooner take than\\nhis. If I’m not greatly mistaken, he’s got something up his sleeve.\\nIsn’t that so, moosier?”\\n\\nPoirot smiled.\\n\\n“I have drawn certain conclusions—yes.”\\n\\nSummerhaye was still looking rather sceptical, but Japp continued his\\nscrutiny of Poirot.\\n\\n“It’s this way,” he said, “so far, we’ve only seen the case from the\\noutside. That’s where the Yard’s at a disadvantage in a case of this\\nkind, where the murder’s only out, so to speak, after the inquest. A\\nlot depends on being on the spot first thing, and that’s where Mr.\\nPoirot’s had the start of us. We shouldn’t have been here as soon as\\nthis even, if it hadn’t been for the fact that there was a smart doctor\\non the spot, who gave us the tip through the Coroner. But you’ve been\\non the spot from the first, and you may have picked up some little\\nhints. From the evidence at the inquest, Mr. Inglethorp murdered his\\nwife as sure as I stand here, and if anyone but you hinted the contrary\\nI’d laugh in his face. I must say I was surprised the jury didn’t bring\\nit in Wilful Murder against him right off. I think they would have, if\\nit hadn’t been for the Coroner—he seemed to be holding them back.”\\n\\n“Perhaps, though, you have a warrant for his arrest in your pocket\\nnow,” suggested Poirot.\\n\\nA kind of wooden shutter of officialdom came down from Japp’s\\nexpressive countenance.\\n\\n“Perhaps I have, and perhaps I haven’t,” he remarked dryly.\\n\\nPoirot looked at him thoughtfully.\\n\\n“I am very anxious, Messieurs, that he should not be arrested.”\\n\\n“I dare say,” observed Summerhaye sarcastically.\\n\\nJapp was regarding Poirot with comical perplexity.\\n\\n“Can’t you go a little further, Mr. Poirot? A wink’s as good as a\\nnod—from you. You’ve been on the spot—and the Yard doesn’t want to make\\nany mistakes, you know.”\\n\\nPoirot nodded gravely.\\n\\n“That is exactly what I thought. Well, I will tell you this. Use your\\nwarrant: Arrest Mr. Inglethorp. But it will bring you no kudos—the case\\nagainst him will be dismissed at once! _Comme ça!_” And he snapped his\\nfingers expressively.\\n\\nJapp’s face grew grave, though Summerhaye gave an incredulous snort.\\n\\nAs for me, I was literally dumb with astonishment. I could only\\nconclude that Poirot was mad.\\n\\nJapp had taken out a handkerchief, and was gently dabbing his brow.\\n\\n“I daren’t do it, Mr. Poirot. _I_’d take your word, but there’s others\\nover me who’ll be asking what the devil I mean by it. Can’t you give me\\na little more to go on?”\\n\\nPoirot reflected a moment.\\n\\n“It can be done,” he said at last. “I admit I do not wish it. It forces\\nmy hand. I would have preferred to work in the dark just for the\\npresent, but what you say is very just—the word of a Belgian policeman,\\nwhose day is past, is not enough! And Alfred Inglethorp must not be\\narrested. That I have sworn, as my friend Hastings here knows. See,\\nthen, my good Japp, you go at once to Styles?”\\n\\n“Well, in about half an hour. We’re seeing the Coroner and the doctor\\nfirst.”\\n\\n“Good. Call for me in passing—the last house in the village. I will go\\nwith you. At Styles, Mr. Inglethorp will give you, or if he refuses—as\\nis probable—I will give you such proofs that shall satisfy you that the\\ncase against him could not possibly be sustained. Is that a bargain?”\\n\\n“That’s a bargain,” said Japp heartily. “And, on behalf of the Yard,\\nI’m much obliged to you, though I’m bound to confess I can’t at present\\nsee the faintest possible loop-hole in the evidence, but you always\\nwere a marvel! So long, then, moosier.”\\n\\nThe two detectives strode away, Summerhaye with an incredulous grin on\\nhis face.\\n\\n“Well, my friend,” cried Poirot, before I could get in a word, “what do\\nyou think? _Mon Dieu!_ I had some warm moments in that court; I did not\\nfigure to myself that the man would be so pig-headed as to refuse to\\nsay anything at all. Decidedly, it was the policy of an imbecile.”\\n\\n“H’m! There are other explanations besides that of imbecility,” I\\nremarked. “For, if the case against him is true, how could he defend\\nhimself except by silence?”\\n\\n“Why, in a thousand ingenious ways,” cried Poirot. “See; say that it is\\nI who have committed this murder, I can think of seven most plausible\\nstories! Far more convincing than Mr. Inglethorp’s stony denials!”\\n\\nI could not help laughing.\\n\\n“My dear Poirot, I am sure you are capable of thinking of seventy! But,\\nseriously, in spite of what I heard you say to the detectives, you\\nsurely cannot still believe in the possibility of Alfred Inglethorp’s\\ninnocence?”\\n\\n“Why not now as much as before? Nothing has changed.”\\n\\n“But the evidence is so conclusive.”\\n\\n“Yes, too conclusive.”\\n\\nWe turned in at the gate of Leastways Cottage, and proceeded up the now\\nfamiliar stairs.\\n\\n“Yes, yes, too conclusive,” continued Poirot, almost to himself. “Real\\nevidence is usually vague and unsatisfactory. It has to be\\nexamined—sifted. But here the whole thing is cut and dried. No, my\\nfriend, this evidence has been very cleverly manufactured—so cleverly\\nthat it has defeated its own ends.”\\n\\n“How do you make that out?”\\n\\n“Because, so long as the evidence against him was vague and intangible,\\nit was very hard to disprove. But, in his anxiety, the criminal has\\ndrawn the net so closely that one cut will set Inglethorp free.”\\n\\nI was silent. And in a minute or two, Poirot continued:\\n\\n“Let us look at the matter like this. Here is a man, let us say, who\\nsets out to poison his wife. He has lived by his wits as the saying\\ngoes. Presumably, therefore, he has some wits. He is not altogether a\\nfool. Well, how does he set about it? He goes boldly to the village\\nchemist’s and purchases strychnine under his own name, with a trumped\\nup story about a dog which is bound to be proved absurd. He does not\\nemploy the poison that night. No, he waits until he has had a violent\\nquarrel with her, of which the whole household is cognisant, and which\\nnaturally directs their suspicions upon him. He prepares no defence—no\\nshadow of an alibi, yet he knows the chemist’s assistant must\\nnecessarily come forward with the facts. Bah! Do not ask me to believe\\nthat any man could be so idiotic! Only a lunatic, who wished to commit\\nsuicide by causing himself to be hanged, would act so!”\\n\\n“Still—I do not see——” I began.\\n\\n“Neither do I see. I tell you, _mon ami_, it puzzles me. _Me_—Hercule\\nPoirot!”\\n\\n“But if you believe him innocent, how do you explain his buying the\\nstrychnine?”\\n\\n“Very simply. He did _not_ buy it.”\\n\\n“But Mace recognized him!”\\n\\n“I beg your pardon, he saw a man with a black beard like Mr.\\nInglethorp’s, and wearing glasses like Mr. Inglethorp, and dressed in\\nMr. Inglethorp’s rather noticeable clothes. He could not recognize a\\nman whom he had probably only seen in the distance, since, you\\nremember, he himself had only been in the village a fortnight, and Mrs.\\nInglethorp dealt principally with Coot’s in Tadminster.”\\n\\n“Then you think——”\\n\\n“_Mon ami_, do you remember the two points I laid stress upon? Leave\\nthe first one for the moment, what was the second?”\\n\\n“The important fact that Alfred Inglethorp wears peculiar clothes, has\\na black beard, and uses glasses,” I quoted.\\n\\n“Exactly. Now suppose anyone wished to pass himself off as John or\\nLawrence Cavendish. Would it be easy?”\\n\\n“No,” I said thoughtfully. “Of course an actor——”\\n\\nBut Poirot cut me short ruthlessly.\\n\\n“And why would it not be easy? I will tell you, my friend: Because they\\nare both clean-shaven men. To make up successfully as one of these two\\nin broad daylight, it would need an actor of genius, and a certain\\ninitial facial resemblance. But in the case of Alfred Inglethorp, all\\nthat is changed. His clothes, his beard, the glasses which hide his\\neyes—those are the salient points about his personal appearance. Now,\\nwhat is the first instinct of the criminal? To divert suspicion from\\nhimself, is it not so? And how can he best do that? By throwing it on\\nsomeone else. In this instance, there was a man ready to his hand.\\nEverybody was predisposed to believe in Mr. Inglethorp’s guilt. It was\\na foregone conclusion that he would be suspected; but, to make it a\\nsure thing there must be tangible proof—such as the actual buying of\\nthe poison, and that, with a man of the peculiar appearance of Mr.\\nInglethorp, was not difficult. Remember, this young Mace had never\\nactually spoken to Mr. Inglethorp. How should he doubt that the man in\\nhis clothes, with his beard and his glasses, was not Alfred\\nInglethorp?”\\n\\n“It may be so,” I said, fascinated by Poirot’s eloquence. “But, if that\\nwas the case, why does he not say where he was at six o’clock on Monday\\nevening?”\\n\\n“Ah, why indeed?” said Poirot, calming down. “If he were arrested, he\\nprobably would speak, but I do not want it to come to that. I must make\\nhim see the gravity of his position. There is, of course, something\\ndiscreditable behind his silence. If he did not murder his wife, he is,\\nnevertheless, a scoundrel, and has something of his own to conceal,\\nquite apart from the murder.”\\n\\n“What can it be?” I mused, won over to Poirot’s views for the moment,\\nalthough still retaining a faint conviction that the obvious deduction\\nwas the correct one.\\n\\n“Can you not guess?” asked Poirot, smiling.\\n\\n“No, can you?”\\n\\n“Oh, yes, I had a little idea sometime ago—and it has turned out to be\\ncorrect.”\\n\\n“You never told me,” I said reproachfully.\\n\\nPoirot spread out his hands apologetically.\\n\\n“Pardon me, _mon ami_, you were not precisely _sympathique_.” He turned\\nto me earnestly. “Tell me—you see now that he must not be arrested?”\\n\\n“Perhaps,” I said doubtfully, for I was really quite indifferent to the\\nfate of Alfred Inglethorp, and thought that a good fright would do him\\nno harm.\\n\\nPoirot, who was watching me intently, gave a sigh.\\n\\n“Come, my friend,” he said, changing the subject, “apart from Mr.\\nInglethorp, how did the evidence at the inquest strike you?”\\n\\n“Oh, pretty much what I expected.”\\n\\n“Did nothing strike you as peculiar about it?”\\n\\nMy thoughts flew to Mary Cavendish, and I hedged:\\n\\n“In what way?”\\n\\n“Well, Mr. Lawrence Cavendish’s evidence for instance?”\\n\\nI was relieved.\\n\\n“Oh, Lawrence! No, I don’t think so. He’s always a nervous chap.”\\n\\n“His suggestion that his mother might have been poisoned accidentally\\nby means of the tonic she was taking, that did not strike you as\\nstrange— _hein?_”\\n\\n“No, I can’t say it did. The doctors ridiculed it of course. But it was\\nquite a natural suggestion for a layman to make.”\\n\\n“But Monsieur Lawrence is not a layman. You told me yourself that he\\nhad started by studying medicine, and that he had taken his degree.”\\n\\n“Yes, that’s true. I never thought of that.” I was rather startled. “It\\n_is_ odd.”\\n\\nPoirot nodded.\\n\\n“From the first, his behaviour has been peculiar. Of all the household,\\nhe alone would be likely to recognize the symptoms of strychnine\\npoisoning, and yet we find him the only member of the family to uphold\\nstrenuously the theory of death from natural causes. If it had been\\nMonsieur John, I could have understood it. He has no technical\\nknowledge, and is by nature unimaginative. But Monsieur Lawrence—no!\\nAnd now, to-day, he puts forward a suggestion that he himself must have\\nknown was ridiculous. There is food for thought in this, _mon ami!_”\\n\\n“It’s very confusing,” I agreed.\\n\\n“Then there is Mrs. Cavendish,” continued Poirot. “That’s another who\\nis not telling all she knows! What do you make of her attitude?”\\n\\n“I don’t know what to make of it. It seems inconceivable that she\\nshould be shielding Alfred Inglethorp. Yet that is what it looks like.”\\n\\nPoirot nodded reflectively.\\n\\n“Yes, it is queer. One thing is certain, she overheard a good deal more\\nof that ‘private conversation’ than she was willing to admit.”\\n\\n“And yet she is the last person one would accuse of stooping to\\neavesdrop!”\\n\\n“Exactly. One thing her evidence _has_ shown me. I made a mistake.\\nDorcas was quite right. The quarrel did take place earlier in the\\nafternoon, about four o’clock, as she said.”\\n\\nI looked at him curiously. I had never understood his insistence on\\nthat point.\\n\\n“Yes, a good deal that was peculiar came out to-day,” continued Poirot.\\n“Dr. Bauerstein, now, what was _he_ doing up and dressed at that hour\\nin the morning? It is astonishing to me that no one commented on the\\nfact.”\\n\\n“He has insomnia, I believe,” I said doubtfully.\\n\\n“Which is a very good, or a very bad explanation,” remarked Poirot. “It\\ncovers everything, and explains nothing. I shall keep my eye on our\\nclever Dr. Bauerstein.”\\n\\n“Any more faults to find with the evidence?” I inquired satirically.\\n\\n“_Mon ami_,” replied Poirot gravely, “when you find that people are not\\ntelling you the truth—look out! Now, unless I am much mistaken, at the\\ninquest to-day only one—at most, two persons were speaking the truth\\nwithout reservation or subterfuge.”\\n\\n“Oh, come now, Poirot! I won’t cite Lawrence, or Mrs. Cavendish. But\\nthere’s John—and Miss Howard, surely they were speaking the truth?”\\n\\n“Both of them, my friend? One, I grant you, but both——!”\\n\\nHis words gave me an unpleasant shock. Miss Howard’s evidence,\\nunimportant as it was, had been given in such a downright\\nstraightforward manner that it had never occurred to me to doubt her\\nsincerity. Still, I had a great respect for Poirot’s sagacity—except on\\nthe occasions when he was what I described to myself as “foolishly\\npig-headed.”\\n\\n“Do you really think so?” I asked. “Miss Howard had always seemed to me\\nso essentially honest—almost uncomfortably so.”\\n\\nPoirot gave me a curious look, which I could not quite fathom. He\\nseemed to speak, and then checked himself.\\n\\n“Miss Murdoch too,” I continued, “there’s nothing untruthful about\\n_her_.”\\n\\n“No. But it was strange that she never heard a sound, sleeping next\\ndoor; whereas Mrs. Cavendish, in the other wing of the building,\\ndistinctly heard the table fall.”\\n\\n“Well, she’s young. And she sleeps soundly.”\\n\\n“Ah, yes, indeed! She must be a famous sleeper, that one!”\\n\\nI did not quite like the tone of his voice, but at that moment a smart\\nknock reached our ears, and looking out of the window we perceived the\\ntwo detectives waiting for us below.\\n\\nPoirot seized his hat, gave a ferocious twist to his moustache, and,\\ncarefully brushing an imaginary speck of dust from his sleeve, motioned\\nme to precede him down the stairs; there we joined the detectives and\\nset out for Styles.\\n\\nI think the appearance of the two Scotland Yard men was rather a\\nshock—especially to John, though of course after the verdict, he had\\nrealized that it was only a matter of time. Still, the presence of the\\ndetectives brought the truth home to him more than anything else could\\nhave done.\\n\\nPoirot had conferred with Japp in a low tone on the way up, and it was\\nthe latter functionary who requested that the household, with the\\nexception of the servants, should be assembled together in the\\ndrawing-room. I realized the significance of this. It was up to Poirot\\nto make his boast good.\\n\\nPersonally, I was not sanguine. Poirot might have excellent reasons for\\nhis belief in Inglethorp’s innocence, but a man of the type of\\nSummerhaye would require tangible proofs, and these I doubted if Poirot\\ncould supply.\\n\\nBefore very long we had all trooped into the drawing-room, the door of\\nwhich Japp closed. Poirot politely set chairs for everyone. The\\nScotland Yard men were the cynosure of all eyes. I think that for the\\nfirst time we realized that the thing was not a bad dream, but a\\ntangible reality. We had read of such things—now we ourselves were\\nactors in the drama. To-morrow the daily papers, all over England,\\nwould blazon out the news in staring headlines:\\n\\n“MYSTERIOUS TRAGEDY IN ESSEX”\\n\\n    “WEALTHY LADY POISONED”\\n\\n\\nThere would be pictures of Styles, snap-shots of “The family leaving\\nthe Inquest”—the village photographer had not been idle! All the things\\nthat one had read a hundred times—things that happen to other people,\\nnot to oneself. And now, in this house, a murder had been committed. In\\nfront of us were “the detectives in charge of the case.” The well-known\\nglib phraseology passed rapidly through my mind in the interval before\\nPoirot opened the proceedings.\\n\\nI think everyone was a little surprised that it should be he and not\\none of the official detectives who took the initiative.\\n\\n“_Mesdames_ and _messieurs_,” said Poirot, bowing as though he were a\\ncelebrity about to deliver a lecture, “I have asked you to come here\\nall together, for a certain object. That object, it concerns Mr. Alfred\\nInglethorp.”\\n\\nInglethorp was sitting a little by himself—I think, unconsciously,\\neveryone had drawn his chair slightly away from him—and he gave a faint\\nstart as Poirot pronounced his name.\\n\\n“Mr. Inglethorp,” said Poirot, addressing him directly, “a very dark\\nshadow is resting on this house—the shadow of murder.”\\n\\nInglethorp shook his head sadly.\\n\\n“My poor wife,” he murmured. “Poor Emily! It is terrible.”\\n\\n“I do not think, monsieur,” said Poirot pointedly, “that you quite\\nrealize how terrible it may be—for you.” And as Inglethorp did not\\nappear to understand, he added: “Mr. Inglethorp, you are standing in\\nvery grave danger.”\\n\\nThe two detectives fidgeted. I saw the official caution “Anything you\\nsay will be used in evidence against you,” actually hovering on\\nSummerhaye’s lips. Poirot went on.\\n\\n“Do you understand now, monsieur?”\\n\\n“No. What do you mean?”\\n\\n“I mean,” said Poirot deliberately, “that you are suspected of\\npoisoning your wife.”\\n\\nA little gasp ran round the circle at this plain speaking.\\n\\n“Good heavens!” cried Inglethorp, starting up. “What a monstrous idea!\\n_I_—poison my dearest Emily!”\\n\\n“I do not think”—Poirot watched him narrowly—“that you quite realize\\nthe unfavourable nature of your evidence at the inquest. Mr.\\nInglethorp, knowing what I have now told you, do you still refuse to\\nsay where you were at six o’clock on Monday afternoon?”\\n\\nWith a groan, Alfred Inglethorp sank down again and buried his face in\\nhis hands. Poirot approached and stood over him.\\n\\n“Speak!” he cried menacingly.\\n\\nWith an effort, Inglethorp raised his face from his hands. Then, slowly\\nand deliberately, he shook his head.\\n\\n“You will not speak?”\\n\\n“No. I do not believe that anyone could be so monstrous as to accuse me\\nof what you say.”\\n\\nPoirot nodded thoughtfully, like a man whose mind is made up.\\n\\n“_Soit!_” he said. “Then I must speak for you.”\\n\\nAlfred Inglethorp sprang up again.\\n\\n“You? How can you speak? You do not know——” he broke off abruptly.\\n\\nPoirot turned to face us. “_Mesdames_ and _messieurs_! I speak! Listen!\\nI, Hercule Poirot, affirm that the man who entered the chemist’s shop,\\nand purchased strychnine at six o’clock on Monday last was not Mr.\\nInglethorp, for at six o’clock on that day Mr. Inglethorp was escorting\\nMrs. Raikes back to her home from a neighbouring farm. I can produce no\\nless than five witnesses to swear to having seen them together, either\\nat six or just after and, as you may know, the Abbey Farm, Mrs.\\nRaikes’s home, is at least two and a half miles distant from the\\nvillage. There is absolutely no question as to the alibi!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII.\\nFRESH SUSPICIONS\\n\\n\\nThere was a moment’s stupefied silence. Japp, who was the least\\nsurprised of any of us, was the first to speak.\\n\\n“My word,” he cried, “you’re the goods! And no mistake, Mr. Poirot!\\nThese witnesses of yours are all right, I suppose?”\\n\\n“_Voilà!_ I have prepared a list of them—names and addresses. You must\\nsee them, of course. But you will find it all right.”\\n\\n“I’m sure of that.” Japp lowered his voice. “I’m much obliged to you. A\\npretty mare’s nest arresting him would have been.” He turned to\\nInglethorp. “But, if you’ll excuse me, sir, why couldn’t you say all\\nthis at the inquest?”\\n\\n“I will tell you why,” interrupted Poirot. “There was a certain\\nrumour——”\\n\\n“A most malicious and utterly untrue one,” interrupted Alfred\\nInglethorp in an agitated voice.\\n\\n“And Mr. Inglethorp was anxious to have no scandal revived just at\\npresent. Am I right?”\\n\\n“Quite right.” Inglethorp nodded. “With my poor Emily not yet buried,\\ncan you wonder I was anxious that no more lying rumours should be\\nstarted.”\\n\\n“Between you and me, sir,” remarked Japp, “I’d sooner have any amount\\nof rumours than be arrested for murder. And I venture to think your\\npoor lady would have felt the same. And, if it hadn’t been for Mr.\\nPoirot here, arrested you would have been, as sure as eggs is eggs!”\\n\\n“I was foolish, no doubt,” murmured Inglethorp. “But you do not know,\\ninspector, how I have been persecuted and maligned.” And he shot a\\nbaleful glance at Evelyn Howard.\\n\\n“Now, sir,” said Japp, turning briskly to John, “I should like to see\\nthe lady’s bedroom, please, and after that I’ll have a little chat with\\nthe servants. Don’t you bother about anything. Mr. Poirot, here, will\\nshow me the way.”\\n\\nAs they all went out of the room, Poirot turned and made me a sign to\\nfollow him upstairs. There he caught me by the arm, and drew me aside.\\n\\n“Quick, go to the other wing. Stand there—just this side of the baize\\ndoor. Do not move till I come.” Then, turning rapidly, he rejoined the\\ntwo detectives.\\n\\nI followed his instructions, taking up my position by the baize door,\\nand wondering what on earth lay behind the request. Why was I to stand\\nin this particular spot on guard? I looked thoughtfully down the\\ncorridor in front of me. An idea struck me. With the exception of\\nCynthia Murdoch’s, everyone’s room was in this left wing. Had that\\nanything to do with it? Was I to report who came or went? I stood\\nfaithfully at my post. The minutes passed. Nobody came. Nothing\\nhappened.\\n\\nIt must have been quite twenty minutes before Poirot rejoined me.\\n\\n“You have not stirred?”\\n\\n“No, I’ve stuck here like a rock. Nothing’s happened.”\\n\\n“Ah!” Was he pleased, or disappointed? “You’ve seen nothing at all?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“But you have probably heard something? A big bump—eh, _mon ami?_”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“Is it possible? Ah, but I am vexed with myself! I am not usually\\nclumsy. I made but a slight gesture”—I know Poirot’s gestures—“with the\\nleft hand, and over went the table by the bed!”\\n\\nHe looked so childishly vexed and crest-fallen that I hastened to\\nconsole him.\\n\\n“Never mind, old chap. What does it matter? Your triumph downstairs\\nexcited you. I can tell you, that was a surprise to us all. There must\\nbe more in this affair of Inglethorp’s with Mrs. Raikes than we\\nthought, to make him hold his tongue so persistently. What are you\\ngoing to do now? Where are the Scotland Yard fellows?”\\n\\n“Gone down to interview the servants. I showed them all our exhibits. I\\nam disappointed in Japp. He has no method!”\\n\\n“Hullo!” I said, looking out of the window. “Here’s Dr. Bauerstein. I\\nbelieve you’re right about that man, Poirot. I don’t like him.”\\n\\n“He is clever,” observed Poirot meditatively.\\n\\n“Oh, clever as the devil! I must say I was overjoyed to see him in the\\nplight he was in on Tuesday. You never saw such a spectacle!” And I\\ndescribed the doctor’s adventure. “He looked a regular scarecrow!\\nPlastered with mud from head to foot.”\\n\\n“You saw him, then?”\\n\\n“Yes. Of course, he didn’t want to come in—it was just after dinner—but\\nMr. Inglethorp insisted.”\\n\\n“What?” Poirot caught me violently by the shoulders. “Was Dr.\\nBauerstein here on Tuesday evening? Here? And you never told me? Why\\ndid you not tell me? Why? Why?”\\n\\nHe appeared to be in an absolute frenzy.\\n\\n“My dear Poirot,” I expostulated, “I never thought it would interest\\nyou. I didn’t know it was of any importance.”\\n\\n“Importance? It is of the first importance! So Dr. Bauerstein was here\\non Tuesday night—the night of the murder. Hastings, do you not see?\\nThat alters everything—everything!”\\n\\nI had never seen him so upset. Loosening his hold of me, he\\nmechanically straightened a pair of candlesticks, still murmuring to\\nhimself: “Yes, that alters everything—everything.”\\n\\nSuddenly he seemed to come to a decision.\\n\\n“_Allons!_” he said. “We must act at once. Where is Mr. Cavendish?”\\n\\nJohn was in the smoking-room. Poirot went straight to him.\\n\\n“Mr. Cavendish, I have some important business in Tadminster. A new\\nclue. May I take your motor?”\\n\\n“Why, of course. Do you mean at once?”\\n\\n“If you please.”\\n\\nJohn rang the bell, and ordered round the car. In another ten minutes,\\nwe were racing down the park and along the high road to Tadminster.\\n\\n“Now, Poirot,” I remarked resignedly, “perhaps you will tell me what\\nall this is about?”\\n\\n“Well, _mon ami_, a good deal you can guess for yourself. Of course you\\nrealize that, now Mr. Inglethorp is out of it, the whole position is\\ngreatly changed. We are face to face with an entirely new problem. We\\nknow now that there is one person who did not buy the poison. We have\\ncleared away the manufactured clues. Now for the real ones. I have\\nascertained that anyone in the household, with the exception of Mrs.\\nCavendish, who was playing tennis with you, could have personated Mr.\\nInglethorp on Monday evening. In the same way, we have his statement\\nthat he put the coffee down in the hall. No one took much notice of\\nthat at the inquest—but now it has a very different significance. We\\nmust find out who did take that coffee to Mrs. Inglethorp eventually,\\nor who passed through the hall whilst it was standing there. From your\\naccount, there are only two people whom we can positively say did not\\ngo near the coffee—Mrs. Cavendish, and Mademoiselle Cynthia.”\\n\\n“Yes, that is so.” I felt an inexpressible lightening of the heart.\\nMary Cavendish could certainly not rest under suspicion.\\n\\n“In clearing Alfred Inglethorp,” continued Poirot, “I have been obliged\\nto show my hand sooner than I intended. As long as I might be thought\\nto be pursuing him, the criminal would be off his guard. Now, he will\\nbe doubly careful. Yes—doubly careful.” He turned to me abruptly. “Tell\\nme, Hastings, you yourself—have you no suspicions of anybody?”\\n\\nI hesitated. To tell the truth, an idea, wild and extravagant in\\nitself, had once or twice that morning flashed through my brain. I had\\nrejected it as absurd, nevertheless it persisted.\\n\\n“You couldn’t call it a suspicion,” I murmured. “It’s so utterly\\nfoolish.”\\n\\n“Come now,” urged Poirot encouragingly. “Do not fear. Speak your mind.\\nYou should always pay attention to your instincts.”\\n\\n“Well then,” I blurted out, “it’s absurd—but I suspect Miss Howard of\\nnot telling all she knows!”\\n\\n“Miss Howard?”\\n\\n“Yes—you’ll laugh at me——”\\n\\n“Not at all. Why should I?”\\n\\n“I can’t help feeling,” I continued blunderingly; “that we’ve rather\\nleft her out of the possible suspects, simply on the strength of her\\nhaving been away from the place. But, after all, she was only fifteen\\nmiles away. A car would do it in half an hour. Can we say positively\\nthat she was away from Styles on the night of the murder?”\\n\\n“Yes, my friend,” said Poirot unexpectedly, “we can. One of my first\\nactions was to ring up the hospital where she was working.”\\n\\n“Well?”\\n\\n“Well, I learnt that Miss Howard had been on afternoon duty on Tuesday,\\nand that—a convoy coming in unexpectedly—she had kindly offered to\\nremain on night duty, which offer was gratefully accepted. That\\ndisposes of that.”\\n\\n“Oh!” I said, rather nonplussed. “Really,” I continued, “it’s her\\nextraordinary vehemence against Inglethorp that started me off\\nsuspecting her. I can’t help feeling she’d do anything against him. And\\nI had an idea she might know something about the destroying of the\\nwill. She might have burnt the new one, mistaking it for the earlier\\none in his favour. She is so terribly bitter against him.”\\n\\n“You consider her vehemence unnatural?”\\n\\n“Y—es. She is so very violent. I wondered really whether she is quite\\nsane on that point.”\\n\\nPoirot shook his head energetically.\\n\\n“No, no, you are on a wrong tack there. There is nothing weak-minded or\\ndegenerate about Miss Howard. She is an excellent specimen of\\nwell-balanced English beef and brawn. She is sanity itself.”\\n\\n“Yet her hatred of Inglethorp seems almost a mania. My idea was—a very\\nridiculous one, no doubt—that she had intended to poison him—and that,\\nin some way, Mrs. Inglethorp got hold of it by mistake. But I don’t at\\nall see how it could have been done. The whole thing is absurd and\\nridiculous to the last degree.”\\n\\n“Still you are right in one thing. It is always wise to suspect\\neverybody until you can prove logically, and to your own satisfaction,\\nthat they are innocent. Now, what reasons are there against Miss\\nHoward’s having deliberately poisoned Mrs. Inglethorp?”\\n\\n“Why, she was devoted to her!” I exclaimed.\\n\\n“Tcha! Tcha!” cried Poirot irritably. “You argue like a child. If Miss\\nHoward were capable of poisoning the old lady, she would be quite\\nequally capable of simulating devotion. No, we must look elsewhere. You\\nare perfectly correct in your assumption that her vehemence against\\nAlfred Inglethorp is too violent to be natural; but you are quite wrong\\nin the deduction you draw from it. I have drawn my own deductions,\\nwhich I believe to be correct, but I will not speak of them at\\npresent.” He paused a minute, then went on. “Now, to my way of\\nthinking, there is one insuperable objection to Miss Howard’s being the\\nmurderess.”\\n\\n“And that is?”\\n\\n“That in no possible way could Mrs. Inglethorp’s death benefit Miss\\nHoward. Now there is no murder without a motive.”\\n\\nI reflected.\\n\\n“Could not Mrs. Inglethorp have made a will in her favour?”\\n\\nPoirot shook his head.\\n\\n“But you yourself suggested that possibility to Mr. Wells?”\\n\\nPoirot smiled.\\n\\n“That was for a reason. I did not want to mention the name of the\\nperson who was actually in my mind. Miss Howard occupied very much the\\nsame position, so I used her name instead.”\\n\\n“Still, Mrs. Inglethorp might have done so. Why, that will, made on the\\nafternoon of her death may——”\\n\\nBut Poirot’s shake of the head was so energetic that I stopped.\\n\\n“No, my friend. I have certain little ideas of my own about that will.\\nBut I can tell you this much—it was not in Miss Howard’s favour.”\\n\\nI accepted his assurance, though I did not really see how he could be\\nso positive about the matter.\\n\\n“Well,” I said, with a sigh, “we will acquit Miss Howard, then. It is\\npartly your fault that I ever came to suspect her. It was what you said\\nabout her evidence at the inquest that set me off.”\\n\\nPoirot looked puzzled.\\n\\n“What did I say about her evidence at the inquest?”\\n\\n“Don’t you remember? When I cited her and John Cavendish as being above\\nsuspicion?”\\n\\n“Oh—ah—yes.” He seemed a little confused, but recovered himself. “By\\nthe way, Hastings, there is something I want you to do for me.”\\n\\n“Certainly. What is it?”\\n\\n“Next time you happen to be alone with Lawrence Cavendish, I want you\\nto say this to him. ‘I have a message for you, from Poirot. He says:\\n“Find the extra coffee-cup, and you can rest in peace!”’ Nothing more.\\nNothing less.”\\n\\n“‘Find the extra coffee-cup, and you can rest in peace.’ Is that\\nright?” I asked, much mystified.\\n\\n“Excellent.”\\n\\n“But what does it mean?”\\n\\n“Ah, that I will leave you to find out. You have access to the facts.\\nJust say that to him, and see what he says.”\\n\\n“Very well—but it’s all extremely mysterious.”\\n\\nWe were running into Tadminster now, and Poirot directed the car to the\\n“Analytical Chemist.”\\n\\nPoirot hopped down briskly, and went inside. In a few minutes he was\\nback again.\\n\\n“There,” he said. “That is all my business.”\\n\\n“What were you doing there?” I asked, in lively curiosity.\\n\\n“I left something to be analysed.”\\n\\n“Yes, but what?”\\n\\n“The sample of cocoa I took from the saucepan in the bedroom.”\\n\\n“But that has already been tested!” I cried, stupefied. “Dr. Bauerstein\\nhad it tested, and you yourself laughed at the possibility of there\\nbeing strychnine in it.”\\n\\n“I know Dr. Bauerstein had it tested,” replied Poirot quietly.\\n\\n“Well, then?”\\n\\n“Well, I have a fancy for having it analysed again, that is all.”\\n\\nAnd not another word on the subject could I drag out of him.\\n\\nThis proceeding of Poirot’s, in respect of the cocoa, puzzled me\\nintensely. I could see neither rhyme nor reason in it. However, my\\nconfidence in him, which at one time had rather waned, was fully\\nrestored since his belief in Alfred Inglethorp’s innocence had been so\\ntriumphantly vindicated.\\n\\nThe funeral of Mrs. Inglethorp took place the following day, and on\\nMonday, as I came down to a late breakfast, John drew me aside, and\\ninformed me that Mr. Inglethorp was leaving that morning, to take up\\nhis quarters at the Stylites Arms until he should have completed his\\nplans.\\n\\n“And really it’s a great relief to think he’s going, Hastings,”\\ncontinued my honest friend. “It was bad enough before, when we thought\\nhe’d done it, but I’m hanged if it isn’t worse now, when we all feel\\nguilty for having been so down on the fellow. The fact is, we’ve\\ntreated him abominably. Of course, things did look black against him. I\\ndon’t see how anyone could blame us for jumping to the conclusions we\\ndid. Still, there it is, we were in the wrong, and now there’s a\\nbeastly feeling that one ought to make amends; which is difficult, when\\none doesn’t like the fellow a bit better than one did before. The whole\\nthing’s damned awkward! And I’m thankful he’s had the tact to take\\nhimself off. It’s a good thing Styles wasn’t the mater’s to leave to\\nhim. Couldn’t bear to think of the fellow lording it here. He’s welcome\\nto her money.”\\n\\n“You’ll be able to keep up the place all right?” I asked.\\n\\n“Oh, yes. There are the death duties, of course, but half my father’s\\nmoney goes with the place, and Lawrence will stay with us for the\\npresent, so there is his share as well. We shall be pinched at first,\\nof course, because, as I once told you, I am in a bit of a hole\\nfinancially myself. Still, the Johnnies will wait now.”\\n\\nIn the general relief at Inglethorp’s approaching departure, we had the\\nmost genial breakfast we had experienced since the tragedy. Cynthia,\\nwhose young spirits were naturally buoyant, was looking quite her\\npretty self again, and we all, with the exception of Lawrence, who\\nseemed unalterably gloomy and nervous, were quietly cheerful, at the\\nopening of a new and hopeful future.\\n\\nThe papers, of course, had been full of the tragedy. Glaring headlines,\\nsandwiched biographies of every member of the household, subtle\\ninnuendoes, the usual familiar tag about the police having a clue.\\nNothing was spared us. It was a slack time. The war was momentarily\\ninactive, and the newspapers seized with avidity on this crime in\\nfashionable life: “The Mysterious Affair at Styles” was the topic of\\nthe moment.\\n\\nNaturally it was very annoying for the Cavendishes. The house was\\nconstantly besieged by reporters, who were consistently denied\\nadmission, but who continued to haunt the village and the grounds,\\nwhere they lay in wait with cameras, for any unwary members of the\\nhousehold. We all lived in a blast of publicity. The Scotland Yard men\\ncame and went, examining, questioning, lynx-eyed and reserved of\\ntongue. Towards what end they were working, we did not know. Had they\\nany clue, or would the whole thing remain in the category of\\nundiscovered crimes?\\n\\nAfter breakfast, Dorcas came up to me rather mysteriously, and asked if\\nshe might have a few words with me.\\n\\n“Certainly. What is it, Dorcas?”\\n\\n“Well, it’s just this, sir. You’ll be seeing the Belgian gentleman\\nto-day perhaps?” I nodded. “Well, sir, you know how he asked me so\\nparticular if the mistress, or anyone else, had a green dress?”\\n\\n“Yes, yes. You have found one?” My interest was aroused.\\n\\n“No, not that, sir. But since then I’ve remembered what the young\\ngentlemen”—John and Lawrence were still the “young gentlemen” to\\nDorcas—“call the ‘dressing-up box.’ It’s up in the front attic, sir. A\\ngreat chest, full of old clothes and fancy dresses, and what not. And\\nit came to me sudden like that there might be a green dress amongst\\nthem. So, if you’d tell the Belgian gentleman——”\\n\\n“I will tell him, Dorcas,” I promised.\\n\\n“Thank you very much, sir. A very nice gentleman he is, sir. And quite\\na different class from them two detectives from London, what goes\\nprying about, and asking questions. I don’t hold with foreigners as a\\nrule, but from what the newspapers say I make out as how these brave\\nBelges isn’t the ordinary run of foreigners, and certainly he’s a most\\npolite spoken gentleman.”\\n\\nDear old Dorcas! As she stood there, with her honest face upturned to\\nmine, I thought what a fine specimen she was of the old-fashioned\\nservant that is so fast dying out.\\n\\nI thought I might as well go down to the village at once, and look up\\nPoirot; but I met him half-way, coming up to the house, and at once\\ngave him Dorcas’s message.\\n\\n“Ah, the brave Dorcas! We will look at the chest, although—but no\\nmatter—we will examine it all the same.”\\n\\nWe entered the house by one of the windows. There was no one in the\\nhall, and we went straight up to the attic.\\n\\nSure enough, there was the chest, a fine old piece, all studded with\\nbrass nails, and full to overflowing with every imaginable type of\\ngarment.\\n\\nPoirot bundled everything out on the floor with scant ceremony. There\\nwere one or two green fabrics of varying shades; but Poirot shook his\\nhead over them all. He seemed somewhat apathetic in the search, as\\nthough he expected no great results from it. Suddenly he gave an\\nexclamation.\\n\\n“What is it?”\\n\\n“Look!”\\n\\nThe chest was nearly empty, and there, reposing right at the bottom,\\nwas a magnificent black beard.\\n\\n“_Ohó!_” said Poirot. “_Ohó!_” He turned it over in his hands,\\nexamining it closely. “New,” he remarked. “Yes, quite new.”\\n\\nAfter a moment’s hesitation, he replaced it in the chest, heaped all\\nthe other things on top of it as before, and made his way briskly\\ndownstairs. He went straight to the pantry, where we found Dorcas\\nbusily polishing her silver.\\n\\nPoirot wished her good morning with Gallic politeness, and went on:\\n\\n“We have been looking through that chest, Dorcas. I am much obliged to\\nyou for mentioning it. There is, indeed, a fine collection there. Are\\nthey often used, may I ask?”\\n\\n“Well, sir, not very often nowadays, though from time to time we do\\nhave what the young gentlemen call ‘a dress-up night.’ And very funny\\nit is sometimes, sir. Mr. Lawrence, he’s wonderful. Most comic! I shall\\nnever forget the night he came down as the Char of Persia, I think he\\ncalled it—a sort of Eastern King it was. He had the big paper knife in\\nhis hand, and ‘Mind, Dorcas,’ he says, ‘you’ll have to be very\\nrespectful. This is my specially sharpened scimitar, and it’s off with\\nyour head if I’m at all displeased with you!’ Miss Cynthia, she was\\nwhat they call an Apache, or some such name—a Frenchified sort of\\ncut-throat, I take it to be. A real sight she looked. You’d never have\\nbelieved a pretty young lady like that could have made herself into\\nsuch a ruffian. Nobody would have known her.”\\n\\n“These evenings must have been great fun,” said Poirot genially. “I\\nsuppose Mr. Lawrence wore that fine black beard in the chest upstairs,\\nwhen he was Shah of Persia?”\\n\\n“He did have a beard, sir,” replied Dorcas, smiling. “And well I know\\nit, for he borrowed two skeins of my black wool to make it with! And\\nI’m sure it looked wonderfully natural at a distance. I didn’t know as\\nthere was a beard up there at all. It must have been got quite lately,\\nI think. There was a red wig, I know, but nothing else in the way of\\nhair. Burnt corks they use mostly—though ‘tis messy getting it off\\nagain. Miss Cynthia was a nigger once, and, oh, the trouble she had.”\\n\\n“So Dorcas knows nothing about that black beard,” said Poirot\\nthoughtfully, as we walked out into the hall again.\\n\\n“Do you think it is _the_ one?” I whispered eagerly.\\n\\nPoirot nodded.\\n\\n“I do. You notice it had been trimmed?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“Yes. It was cut exactly the shape of Mr. Inglethorp’s, and I found one\\nor two snipped hairs. Hastings, this affair is very deep.”\\n\\n“Who put it in the chest, I wonder?”\\n\\n“Someone with a good deal of intelligence,” remarked Poirot dryly. “You\\nrealize that he chose the one place in the house to hide it where its\\npresence would not be remarked? Yes, he is intelligent. But we must be\\nmore intelligent. We must be so intelligent that he does not suspect us\\nof being intelligent at all.”\\n\\nI acquiesced.\\n\\n“There, _mon ami_, you will be of great assistance to me.”\\n\\nI was pleased with the compliment. There had been times when I hardly\\nthought that Poirot appreciated me at my true worth.\\n\\n“Yes,” he continued, staring at me thoughtfully, “you will be\\ninvaluable.”\\n\\nThis was naturally gratifying, but Poirot’s next words were not so\\nwelcome.\\n\\n“I must have an ally in the house,” he observed reflectively.\\n\\n“You have me,” I protested.\\n\\n“True, but you are not sufficient.”\\n\\nI was hurt, and showed it. Poirot hurried to explain himself.\\n\\n“You do not quite take my meaning. You are known to be working with me.\\nI want somebody who is not associated with us in any way.”\\n\\n“Oh, I see. How about John?”\\n\\n“No, I think not.”\\n\\n“The dear fellow isn’t perhaps very bright,” I said thoughtfully.\\n\\n“Here comes Miss Howard,” said Poirot suddenly. “She is the very\\nperson. But I am in her black books, since I cleared Mr. Inglethorp.\\nStill, we can but try.”\\n\\nWith a nod that was barely civil, Miss Howard assented to Poirot’s\\nrequest for a few minutes’ conversation.\\n\\nWe went into the little morning-room, and Poirot closed the door.\\n\\n“Well, Monsieur Poirot,” said Miss Howard impatiently, “what is it? Out\\nwith it. I’m busy.”\\n\\n“Do you remember, mademoiselle, that I once asked you to help me?”\\n\\n“Yes, I do.” The lady nodded. “And I told you I’d help you with\\npleasure—to hang Alfred Inglethorp.”\\n\\n“Ah!” Poirot studied her seriously. “Miss Howard, I will ask you one\\nquestion. I beg of you to reply to it truthfully.”\\n\\n“Never tell lies,” replied Miss Howard.\\n\\n“It is this. Do you still believe that Mrs. Inglethorp was poisoned by\\nher husband?”\\n\\n“What do you mean?” she asked sharply. “You needn’t think your pretty\\nexplanations influence me in the slightest. I’ll admit that it wasn’t\\nhe who bought strychnine at the chemist’s shop. What of that? I dare\\nsay he soaked fly paper, as I told you at the beginning.”\\n\\n“That is arsenic—not strychnine,” said Poirot mildly.\\n\\n“What does that matter? Arsenic would put poor Emily out of the way\\njust as well as strychnine. If I’m convinced he did it, it doesn’t\\nmatter a jot to me _how_ he did it.”\\n\\n“Exactly. _If_ you are convinced he did it,” said Poirot quietly. “I\\nwill put my question in another form. Did you ever in your heart of\\nhearts believe that Mrs. Inglethorp was poisoned by her husband?”\\n\\n“Good heavens!” cried Miss Howard. “Haven’t I always told you the man\\nis a villain? Haven’t I always told you he would murder her in her bed?\\nHaven’t I always hated him like poison?”\\n\\n“Exactly,” said Poirot. “That bears out my little idea entirely.”\\n\\n“What little idea?”\\n\\n“Miss Howard, do you remember a conversation that took place on the day\\nof my friend’s arrival here? He repeated it to me, and there is a\\nsentence of yours that has impressed me very much. Do you remember\\naffirming that if a crime had been committed, and anyone you loved had\\nbeen murdered, you felt certain that you would know by instinct who the\\ncriminal was, even if you were quite unable to prove it?”\\n\\n“Yes, I remember saying that. I believe it too. I suppose you think it\\nnonsense?”\\n\\n“Not at all.”\\n\\n“And yet you will pay no attention to my instinct against Alfred\\nInglethorp.”\\n\\n“No,” said Poirot curtly. “Because your instinct is not against Mr.\\nInglethorp.”\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“No. You wish to believe he committed the crime. You believe him\\ncapable of committing it. But your instinct tells you he did not commit\\nit. It tells you more—shall I go on?”\\n\\nShe was staring at him, fascinated, and made a slight affirmative\\nmovement of the hand.\\n\\n“Shall I tell you why you have been so vehement against Mr. Inglethorp?\\nIt is because you have been trying to believe what you wish to believe.\\nIt is because you are trying to drown and stifle your instinct, which\\ntells you another name——”\\n\\n“No, no, no!” cried Miss Howard wildly, flinging up her hands. “Don’t\\nsay it! Oh, don’t say it! It isn’t true! It can’t be true. I don’t know\\nwhat put such a wild—such a dreadful—idea into my head!”\\n\\n“I am right, am I not?” asked Poirot.\\n\\n“Yes, yes; you must be a wizard to have guessed. But it can’t be\\nso—it’s too monstrous, too impossible. It _must_ be Alfred Inglethorp.”\\n\\nPoirot shook his head gravely.\\n\\n“Don’t ask me about it,” continued Miss Howard, “because I shan’t tell\\nyou. I won’t admit it, even to myself. I must be mad to think of such a\\nthing.”\\n\\nPoirot nodded, as if satisfied.\\n\\n“I will ask you nothing. It is enough for me that it is as I thought.\\nAnd I—I, too, have an instinct. We are working together towards a\\ncommon end.”\\n\\n“Don’t ask me to help you, because I won’t. I wouldn’t lift a finger\\nto—to——” She faltered.\\n\\n“You will help me in spite of yourself. I ask you nothing—but you will\\nbe my ally. You will not be able to help yourself. You will do the only\\nthing that I want of you.”\\n\\n“And that is?”\\n\\n“You will watch!”\\n\\nEvelyn Howard bowed her head.\\n\\n“Yes, I can’t help doing that. I am always watching—always hoping I\\nshall be proved wrong.”\\n\\n“If we are wrong, well and good,” said Poirot. “No one will be more\\npleased than I shall. But, if we are right? If we are right, Miss\\nHoward, on whose side are you then?”\\n\\n“I don’t know, I don’t know——”\\n\\n“Come now.”\\n\\n“It could be hushed up.”\\n\\n“There must be no hushing up.”\\n\\n“But Emily herself——” She broke off.\\n\\n“Miss Howard,” said Poirot gravely, “this is unworthy of you.”\\n\\nSuddenly she took her face from her hands.\\n\\n“Yes,” she said quietly, “that was not Evelyn Howard who spoke!” She\\nflung her head up proudly. “_This_ is Evelyn Howard! And she is on the\\nside of Justice! Let the cost be what it may.” And with these words,\\nshe walked firmly out of the room.\\n\\n“There,” said Poirot, looking after her, “goes a very valuable ally.\\nThat woman, Hastings, has got brains as well as a heart.”\\n\\nI did not reply.\\n\\n“Instinct is a marvellous thing,” mused Poirot. “It can neither be\\nexplained nor ignored.”\\n\\n“You and Miss Howard seem to know what you are talking about,” I\\nobserved coldly. “Perhaps you don’t realize that _I_ am still in the\\ndark.”\\n\\n“Really? Is that so, _mon ami?_”\\n\\n“Yes. Enlighten me, will you?”\\n\\nPoirot studied me attentively for a moment or two. Then, to my intense\\nsurprise, he shook his head decidedly.\\n\\n“No, my friend.”\\n\\n“Oh, look here, why not?”\\n\\n“Two is enough for a secret.”\\n\\n“Well, I think it is very unfair to keep back facts from me.”\\n\\n“I am not keeping back facts. Every fact that I know is in your\\npossession. You can draw your own deductions from them. This time it is\\na question of ideas.”\\n\\n“Still, it would be interesting to know.”\\n\\nPoirot looked at me very earnestly, and again shook his head.\\n\\n“You see,” he said sadly, “_you_ have no instincts.”\\n\\n“It was intelligence you were requiring just now,” I pointed out.\\n\\n“The two often go together,” said Poirot enigmatically.\\n\\nThe remark seemed so utterly irrelevant that I did not even take the\\ntrouble to answer it. But I decided that if I made any interesting and\\nimportant discoveries—as no doubt I should—I would keep them to myself,\\nand surprise Poirot with the ultimate result.\\n\\nThere are times when it is one’s duty to assert oneself.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX.\\nDR. BAUERSTEIN\\n\\n\\nI had had no opportunity as yet of passing on Poirot’s message to\\nLawrence. But now, as I strolled out on the lawn, still nursing a\\ngrudge against my friend’s high-handedness, I saw Lawrence on the\\ncroquet lawn, aimlessly knocking a couple of very ancient balls about,\\nwith a still more ancient mallet.\\n\\nIt struck me that it would be a good opportunity to deliver my message.\\nOtherwise, Poirot himself might relieve me of it. It was true that I\\ndid not quite gather its purport, but I flattered myself that by\\nLawrence’s reply, and perhaps a little skillful cross-examination on my\\npart, I should soon perceive its significance. Accordingly I accosted\\nhim.\\n\\n“I’ve been looking for you,” I remarked untruthfully.\\n\\n“Have you?”\\n\\n“Yes. The truth is, I’ve got a message for you—from Poirot.”\\n\\n“Yes?”\\n\\n“He told me to wait until I was alone with you,” I said, dropping my\\nvoice significantly, and watching him intently out of the corner of my\\neye. I have always been rather good at what is called, I believe,\\ncreating an atmosphere.\\n\\n“Well?”\\n\\nThere was no change of expression in the dark melancholic face. Had he\\nany idea of what I was about to say?\\n\\n“This is the message.” I dropped my voice still lower. “‘Find the extra\\ncoffee-cup, and you can rest in peace.’”\\n\\n“What on earth does he mean?” Lawrence stared at me in quite unaffected\\nastonishment.\\n\\n“Don’t you know?”\\n\\n“Not in the least. Do you?”\\n\\nI was compelled to shake my head.\\n\\n“What extra coffee-cup?”\\n\\n“I don’t know.”\\n\\n“He’d better ask Dorcas, or one of the maids, if he wants to know about\\ncoffee-cups. It’s their business, not mine. I don’t know anything about\\nthe coffee-cups, except that we’ve got some that are never used, which\\nare a perfect dream! Old Worcester. You’re not a connoisseur, are you,\\nHastings?”\\n\\nI shook my head.\\n\\n“You miss a lot. A really perfect bit of old china—it’s pure delight to\\nhandle it, or even to look at it.”\\n\\n“Well, what am I to tell Poirot?”\\n\\n“Tell him I don’t know what he’s talking about. It’s double Dutch to\\nme.”\\n\\n“All right.”\\n\\nI was moving off towards the house again when he suddenly called me\\nback.\\n\\n“I say, what was the end of that message? Say it over again, will you?”\\n\\n“‘Find the extra coffee-cup, and you can rest in peace.’ Are you sure\\nyou don’t know what it means?” I asked him earnestly.\\n\\nHe shook his head.\\n\\n“No,” he said musingly, “I don’t. I—I wish I did.”\\n\\nThe boom of the gong sounded from the house, and we went in together.\\nPoirot had been asked by John to remain to lunch, and was already\\nseated at the table.\\n\\nBy tacit consent, all mention of the tragedy was barred. We conversed\\non the war, and other outside topics. But after the cheese and biscuits\\nhad been handed round, and Dorcas had left the room, Poirot suddenly\\nleant forward to Mrs. Cavendish.\\n\\n“Pardon me, madame, for recalling unpleasant memories, but I have a\\nlittle idea”—Poirot’s “little ideas” were becoming a perfect\\nbyword—“and would like to ask one or two questions.”\\n\\n“Of me? Certainly.”\\n\\n“You are too amiable, madame. What I want to ask is this: the door\\nleading into Mrs. Inglethorp’s room from that of Mademoiselle Cynthia,\\nit was bolted, you say?”\\n\\n“Certainly it was bolted,” replied Mary Cavendish, rather surprised. “I\\nsaid so at the inquest.”\\n\\n“Bolted?”\\n\\n“Yes.” She looked perplexed.\\n\\n“I mean,” explained Poirot, “you are sure it was bolted, and not merely\\nlocked?”\\n\\n“Oh, I see what you mean. No, I don’t know. I said bolted, meaning that\\nit was fastened, and I could not open it, but I believe all the doors\\nwere found bolted on the inside.”\\n\\n“Still, as far as you are concerned, the door might equally well have\\nbeen locked?”\\n\\n“Oh, yes.”\\n\\n“You yourself did not happen to notice, madame, when you entered Mrs.\\nInglethorp’s room, whether that door was bolted or not?”\\n\\n“I—I believe it was.”\\n\\n“But you did not see it?”\\n\\n“No. I—never looked.”\\n\\n“But _I_ did,” interrupted Lawrence suddenly. “I happened to notice\\nthat it _was_ bolted.”\\n\\n“Ah, that settles it.” And Poirot looked crestfallen.\\n\\nI could not help rejoicing that, for once, one of his “little ideas”\\nhad come to naught.\\n\\nAfter lunch Poirot begged me to accompany him home. I consented rather\\nstiffly.\\n\\n“You are annoyed, is it not so?” he asked anxiously, as we walked\\nthrough the park.\\n\\n“Not at all,” I said coldly.\\n\\n“That is well. That lifts a great load from my mind.”\\n\\nThis was not quite what I had intended. I had hoped that he would have\\nobserved the stiffness of my manner. Still, the fervour of his words\\nwent towards the appeasing of my just displeasure. I thawed.\\n\\n“I gave Lawrence your message,” I said.\\n\\n“And what did he say? He was entirely puzzled?”\\n\\n“Yes. I am quite sure he had no idea of what you meant.”\\n\\nI had expected Poirot to be disappointed; but, to my surprise, he\\nreplied that that was as he had thought, and that he was very glad. My\\npride forbade me to ask any questions.\\n\\nPoirot switched off on another tack.\\n\\n“Mademoiselle Cynthia was not at lunch to-day? How was that?”\\n\\n“She is at the hospital again. She resumed work to-day.”\\n\\n“Ah, she is an industrious little demoiselle. And pretty too. She is\\nlike pictures I have seen in Italy. I would rather like to see that\\ndispensary of hers. Do you think she would show it to me?”\\n\\n“I am sure she would be delighted. It’s an interesting little place.”\\n\\n“Does she go there every day?”\\n\\n“She has all Wednesdays off, and comes back to lunch on Saturdays.\\nThose are her only times off.”\\n\\n“I will remember. Women are doing great work nowadays, and Mademoiselle\\nCynthia is clever—oh, yes, she has brains, that little one.”\\n\\n“Yes. I believe she has passed quite a stiff exam.”\\n\\n“Without doubt. After all, it is very responsible work. I suppose they\\nhave very strong poisons there?”\\n\\n“Yes, she showed them to us. They are kept locked up in a little\\ncupboard. I believe they have to be very careful. They always take out\\nthe key before leaving the room.”\\n\\n“Indeed. It is near the window, this cupboard?”\\n\\n“No, right the other side of the room. Why?”\\n\\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n“I wondered. That is all. Will you come in?”\\n\\nWe had reached the cottage.\\n\\n“No. I think I’ll be getting back. I shall go round the long way\\nthrough the woods.”\\n\\nThe woods round Styles were very beautiful. After the walk across the\\nopen park, it was pleasant to saunter lazily through the cool glades.\\nThere was hardly a breath of wind, the very chirp of the birds was\\nfaint and subdued. I strolled on a little way, and finally flung myself\\ndown at the foot of a grand old beech-tree. My thoughts of mankind were\\nkindly and charitable. I even forgave Poirot for his absurd secrecy. In\\nfact, I was at peace with the world. Then I yawned.\\n\\nI thought about the crime, and it struck me as being very unreal and\\nfar off.\\n\\nI yawned again.\\n\\nProbably, I thought, it really never happened. Of course, it was all a\\nbad dream. The truth of the matter was that it was Lawrence who had\\nmurdered Alfred Inglethorp with a croquet mallet. But it was absurd of\\nJohn to make such a fuss about it, and to go shouting out: “I tell you\\nI won’t have it!”\\n\\nI woke up with a start.\\n\\nAt once I realized that I was in a very awkward predicament. For, about\\ntwelve feet away from me, John and Mary Cavendish were standing facing\\neach other, and they were evidently quarrelling. And, quite as\\nevidently, they were unaware of my vicinity, for before I could move or\\nspeak John repeated the words which had aroused me from my dream.\\n\\n“I tell you, Mary, I won’t have it.”\\n\\nMary’s voice came, cool and liquid:\\n\\n“Have _you_ any right to criticize my actions?”\\n\\n“It will be the talk of the village! My mother was only buried on\\nSaturday, and here you are gadding about with the fellow.”\\n\\n“Oh,” she shrugged her shoulders, “if it is only village gossip that\\nyou mind!”\\n\\n“But it isn’t. I’ve had enough of the fellow hanging about. He’s a\\nPolish Jew, anyway.”\\n\\n“A tinge of Jewish blood is not a bad thing. It leavens the”—she looked\\nat him—“stolid stupidity of the ordinary Englishman.”\\n\\nFire in her eyes, ice in her voice. I did not wonder that the blood\\nrose to John’s face in a crimson tide.\\n\\n“Mary!”\\n\\n“Well?” Her tone did not change.\\n\\nThe pleading died out of his voice.\\n\\n“Am I to understand that you will continue to see Bauerstein against my\\nexpress wishes?”\\n\\n“If I choose.”\\n\\n“You defy me?”\\n\\n“No, but I deny your right to criticize my actions. Have _you_ no\\nfriends of whom I should disapprove?”\\n\\nJohn fell back a pace. The colour ebbed slowly from his face.\\n\\n“What do you mean?” he said, in an unsteady voice.\\n\\n“You see!” said Mary quietly. “You _do_ see, don’t you, that _you_ have\\nno right to dictate to _me_ as to the choice of my friends?”\\n\\nJohn glanced at her pleadingly, a stricken look on his face.\\n\\n“No right? Have I _no_ right, Mary?” he said unsteadily. He stretched\\nout his hands. “Mary——”\\n\\nFor a moment, I thought she wavered. A softer expression came over her\\nface, then suddenly she turned almost fiercely away.\\n\\n“None!”\\n\\nShe was walking away when John sprang after her, and caught her by the\\narm.\\n\\n“Mary”—his voice was very quiet now—“are you in love with this fellow\\nBauerstein?”\\n\\nShe hesitated, and suddenly there swept across her face a strange\\nexpression, old as the hills, yet with something eternally young about\\nit. So might some Egyptian sphinx have smiled.\\n\\nShe freed herself quietly from his arm, and spoke over her shoulder.\\n\\n“Perhaps,” she said; and then swiftly passed out of the little glade,\\nleaving John standing there as though he had been turned to stone.\\n\\nRather ostentatiously, I stepped forward, crackling some dead branches\\nwith my feet as I did so. John turned. Luckily, he took it for granted\\nthat I had only just come upon the scene.\\n\\n“Hullo, Hastings. Have you seen the little fellow safely back to his\\ncottage? Quaint little chap! Is he any good, though, really?”\\n\\n“He was considered one of the finest detectives of his day.”\\n\\n“Oh, well, I suppose there must be something in it, then. What a rotten\\nworld it is, though!”\\n\\n“You find it so?” I asked.\\n\\n“Good Lord, yes! There’s this terrible business to start with. Scotland\\nYard men in and out of the house like a jack-in-the-box! Never know\\nwhere they won’t turn up next. Screaming headlines in every paper in\\nthe country—damn all journalists, I say! Do you know there was a whole\\ncrowd staring in at the lodge gates this morning. Sort of Madame\\nTussaud’s chamber of horrors business that can be seen for nothing.\\nPretty thick, isn’t it?”\\n\\n“Cheer up, John!” I said soothingly. “It can’t last for ever.”\\n\\n“Can’t it, though? It can last long enough for us never to be able to\\nhold up our heads again.”\\n\\n“No, no, you’re getting morbid on the subject.”\\n\\n“Enough to make a man morbid, to be stalked by beastly journalists and\\nstared at by gaping moon-faced idiots, wherever he goes! But there’s\\nworse than that.”\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\nJohn lowered his voice:\\n\\n“Have you ever thought, Hastings—it’s a nightmare to me—who did it? I\\ncan’t help feeling sometimes it must have been an accident.\\nBecause—because—who could have done it? Now Inglethorp’s out of the\\nway, there’s no one else; no one, I mean, except—one of us.”\\n\\nYes, indeed, that was nightmare enough for any man! One of us? Yes,\\nsurely it must be so, unless——-\\n\\nA new idea suggested itself to my mind. Rapidly, I considered it. The\\nlight increased. Poirot’s mysterious doings, his hints—they all fitted\\nin. Fool that I was not to have thought of this possibility before, and\\nwhat a relief for us all.\\n\\n“No, John,” I said, “it isn’t one of us. How could it be?”\\n\\n“I know, but, still, who else is there?”\\n\\n“Can’t you guess?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\nI looked cautiously round, and lowered my voice.\\n\\n“Dr. Bauerstein!” I whispered.\\n\\n“Impossible!”\\n\\n“Not at all.”\\n\\n“But what earthly interest could he have in my mother’s death?”\\n\\n“That I don’t see,” I confessed, “but I’ll tell you this: Poirot thinks\\nso.”\\n\\n“Poirot? Does he? How do you know?”\\n\\nI told him of Poirot’s intense excitement on hearing that Dr.\\nBauerstein had been at Styles on the fatal night, and added:\\n\\n“He said twice: ‘That alters everything.’ And I’ve been thinking. You\\nknow Inglethorp said he had put down the coffee in the hall? Well, it\\nwas just then that Bauerstein arrived. Isn’t it possible that, as\\nInglethorp brought him through the hall, the doctor dropped something\\ninto the coffee in passing?”\\n\\n“H’m,” said John. “It would have been very risky.”\\n\\n“Yes, but it was possible.”\\n\\n“And then, how could he know it was her coffee? No, old fellow, I don’t\\nthink that will wash.”\\n\\nBut I had remembered something else.\\n\\n“You’re quite right. That wasn’t how it was done. Listen.” And I then\\ntold him of the cocoa sample which Poirot had taken to be analysed.\\n\\nJohn interrupted just as I had done.\\n\\n“But, look here, Bauerstein had had it analysed already?”\\n\\n“Yes, yes, that’s the point. I didn’t see it either until now. Don’t\\nyou understand? Bauerstein had it analysed—that’s just it! If\\nBauerstein’s the murderer, nothing could be simpler than for him to\\nsubstitute some ordinary cocoa for his sample, and send that to be\\ntested. And of course they would find no strychnine! But no one would\\ndream of suspecting Bauerstein, or think of taking another\\nsample—except Poirot,” I added, with belated recognition.\\n\\n“Yes, but what about the bitter taste that cocoa won’t disguise?”\\n\\n“Well, we’ve only his word for that. And there are other possibilities.\\nHe’s admittedly one of the world’s greatest toxicologists——”\\n\\n“One of the world’s greatest what? Say it again.”\\n\\n“He knows more about poisons than almost anybody,” I explained. “Well,\\nmy idea is, that perhaps he’s found some way of making strychnine\\ntasteless. Or it may not have been strychnine at all, but some obscure\\ndrug no one has ever heard of, which produces much the same symptoms.”\\n\\n“H’m, yes, that might be,” said John. “But look here, how could he have\\ngot at the cocoa? That wasn’t downstairs?”\\n\\n“No, it wasn’t,” I admitted reluctantly.\\n\\nAnd then, suddenly, a dreadful possibility flashed through my mind. I\\nhoped and prayed it would not occur to John also. I glanced sideways at\\nhim. He was frowning perplexedly, and I drew a deep breath of relief,\\nfor the terrible thought that had flashed across my mind was this: that\\nDr. Bauerstein might have had an accomplice.\\n\\nYet surely it could not be! Surely no woman as beautiful as Mary\\nCavendish could be a murderess. Yet beautiful women had been known to\\npoison.\\n\\nAnd suddenly I remembered that first conversation at tea on the day of\\nmy arrival, and the gleam in her eyes as she had said that poison was a\\nwoman’s weapon. How agitated she had been on that fatal Tuesday\\nevening! Had Mrs. Inglethorp discovered something between her and\\nBauerstein, and threatened to tell her husband? Was it to stop that\\ndenunciation that the crime had been committed?\\n\\nThen I remembered that enigmatical conversation between Poirot and\\nEvelyn Howard. Was this what they had meant? Was this the monstrous\\npossibility that Evelyn had tried not to believe?\\n\\nYes, it all fitted in.\\n\\nNo wonder Miss Howard had suggested “hushing it up.” Now I understood\\nthat unfinished sentence of hers: “Emily herself——” And in my heart I\\nagreed with her. Would not Mrs. Inglethorp have preferred to go\\nunavenged rather than have such terrible dishonour fall upon the name\\nof Cavendish.\\n\\n“There’s another thing,” said John suddenly, and the unexpected sound\\nof his voice made me start guiltily. “Something which makes me doubt if\\nwhat you say can be true.”\\n\\n“What’s that?” I asked, thankful that he had gone away from the subject\\nof how the poison could have been introduced into the cocoa.\\n\\n“Why, the fact that Bauerstein demanded a post-mortem. He needn’t have\\ndone so. Little Wilkins would have been quite content to let it go at\\nheart disease.”\\n\\n“Yes,” I said doubtfully. “But we don’t know. Perhaps he thought it\\nsafer in the long run. Someone might have talked afterwards. Then the\\nHome Office might have ordered exhumation. The whole thing would have\\ncome out, then, and he would have been in an awkward position, for no\\none would have believed that a man of his reputation could have been\\ndeceived into calling it heart disease.”\\n\\n“Yes, that’s possible,” admitted John. “Still,” he added, “I’m blest if\\nI can see what his motive could have been.”\\n\\nI trembled.\\n\\n“Look here,” I said, “I may be altogether wrong. And, remember, all\\nthis is in confidence.”\\n\\n“Oh, of course—that goes without saying.”\\n\\nWe had walked, as we talked, and now we passed through the little gate\\ninto the garden. Voices rose near at hand, for tea was spread out under\\nthe sycamore-tree, as it had been on the day of my arrival.\\n\\nCynthia was back from the hospital, and I placed my chair beside her,\\nand told her of Poirot’s wish to visit the dispensary.\\n\\n“Of course! I’d love him to see it. He’d better come to tea there one\\nday. I must fix it up with him. He’s such a dear little man! But he\\n_is_ funny. He made me take the brooch out of my tie the other day, and\\nput it in again, because he said it wasn’t straight.”\\n\\nI laughed.\\n\\n“It’s quite a mania with him.”\\n\\n“Yes, isn’t it?”\\n\\nWe were silent for a minute or two, and then, glancing in the direction\\nof Mary Cavendish, and dropping her voice, Cynthia said:\\n\\n“Mr. Hastings.”\\n\\n“Yes?”\\n\\n“After tea, I want to talk to you.”\\n\\nHer glance at Mary had set me thinking. I fancied that between these\\ntwo there existed very little sympathy. For the first time, it occurred\\nto me to wonder about the girl’s future. Mrs. Inglethorp had made no\\nprovisions of any kind for her, but I imagined that John and Mary would\\nprobably insist on her making her home with them—at any rate until the\\nend of the war. John, I knew, was very fond of her, and would be sorry\\nto let her go.\\n\\nJohn, who had gone into the house, now reappeared. His good-natured\\nface wore an unaccustomed frown of anger.\\n\\n“Confound those detectives! I can’t think what they’re after! They’ve\\nbeen in every room in the house—turning things inside out, and upside\\ndown. It really is too bad! I suppose they took advantage of our all\\nbeing out. I shall go for that fellow Japp, when I next see him!”\\n\\n“Lot of Paul Prys,” grunted Miss Howard.\\n\\nLawrence opined that they had to make a show of doing something.\\n\\nMary Cavendish said nothing.\\n\\nAfter tea, I invited Cynthia to come for a walk, and we sauntered off\\ninto the woods together.\\n\\n“Well?” I inquired, as soon as we were protected from prying eyes by\\nthe leafy screen.\\n\\nWith a sigh, Cynthia flung herself down, and tossed off her hat. The\\nsunlight, piercing through the branches, turned the auburn of her hair\\nto quivering gold.\\n\\n“Mr. Hastings—you are always so kind, and you know such a lot.”\\n\\nIt struck me at this moment that Cynthia was really a very charming\\ngirl! Much more charming than Mary, who never said things of that kind.\\n\\n“Well?” I asked benignantly, as she hesitated.\\n\\n“I want to ask your advice. What shall I do?”\\n\\n“Do?”\\n\\n“Yes. You see, Aunt Emily always told me I should be provided for. I\\nsuppose she forgot, or didn’t think she was likely to die—anyway, I am\\n_not_ provided for! And I don’t know what to do. Do you think I ought\\nto go away from here at once?”\\n\\n“Good heavens, no! They don’t want to part with you, I’m sure.”\\n\\nCynthia hesitated a moment, plucking up the grass with her tiny hands.\\nThen she said: “Mrs. Cavendish does. She hates me.”\\n\\n“Hates you?” I cried, astonished.\\n\\nCynthia nodded.\\n\\n“Yes. I don’t know why, but she can’t bear me; and _he_ can’t, either.”\\n\\n“There I know you’re wrong,” I said warmly. “On the contrary, John is\\nvery fond of you.”\\n\\n“Oh, yes—_John_. I meant Lawrence. Not, of course, that I care whether\\nLawrence hates me or not. Still, it’s rather horrid when no one loves\\nyou, isn’t it?”\\n\\n“But they do, Cynthia dear,” I said earnestly. “I’m sure you are\\nmistaken. Look, there is John—and Miss Howard——”\\n\\nCynthia nodded rather gloomily. “Yes, John likes me, I think, and of\\ncourse Evie, for all her gruff ways, wouldn’t be unkind to a fly. But\\nLawrence never speaks to me if he can help it, and Mary can hardly\\nbring herself to be civil to me. She wants Evie to stay on, is begging\\nher to, but she doesn’t want me, and—and—I don’t know what to do.”\\nSuddenly the poor child burst out crying.\\n\\nI don’t know what possessed me. Her beauty, perhaps, as she sat there,\\nwith the sunlight glinting down on her head; perhaps the sense of\\nrelief at encountering someone who so obviously could have no\\nconnection with the tragedy; perhaps honest pity for her youth and\\nloneliness. Anyway, I leant forward, and taking her little hand, I said\\nawkwardly:\\n\\n“Marry me, Cynthia.”\\n\\nUnwittingly, I had hit upon a sovereign remedy for her tears. She sat\\nup at once, drew her hand away, and said, with some asperity:\\n\\n“Don’t be silly!”\\n\\nI was a little annoyed.\\n\\n“I’m not being silly. I am asking you to do me the honour of becoming\\nmy wife.”\\n\\nTo my intense surprise, Cynthia burst out laughing, and called me a\\n“funny dear.”\\n\\n“It’s perfectly sweet of you,” she said, “but you know you don’t want\\nto!”\\n\\n“Yes, I do. I’ve got——”\\n\\n“Never mind what you’ve got. You don’t really want to—and I don’t\\neither.”\\n\\n“Well, of course, that settles it,” I said stiffly. “But I don’t see\\nanything to laugh at. There’s nothing funny about a proposal.”\\n\\n“No, indeed,” said Cynthia. “Somebody might accept you next time.\\nGood-bye, you’ve cheered me up _very_ much.”\\n\\nAnd, with a final uncontrollable burst of merriment, she vanished\\nthrough the trees.\\n\\nThinking over the interview, it struck me as being profoundly\\nunsatisfactory.\\n\\nIt occurred to me suddenly that I would go down to the village, and\\nlook up Bauerstein. Somebody ought to be keeping an eye on the fellow.\\nAt the same time, it would be wise to allay any suspicions he might\\nhave as to his being suspected. I remembered how Poirot had relied on\\nmy diplomacy. Accordingly, I went to the little house with the\\n“Apartments” card inserted in the window, where I knew he lodged, and\\ntapped on the door.\\n\\nAn old woman came and opened it.\\n\\n“Good afternoon,” I said pleasantly. “Is Dr. Bauerstein in?”\\n\\nShe stared at me.\\n\\n“Haven’t you heard?”\\n\\n“Heard what?”\\n\\n“About him.”\\n\\n“What about him?”\\n\\n“He’s took.”\\n\\n“Took? Dead?”\\n\\n“No, took by the perlice.”\\n\\n“By the police!” I gasped. “Do you mean they’ve arrested him?”\\n\\n“Yes, that’s it, and——”\\n\\nI waited to hear no more, but tore up the village to find Poirot.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X.\\nTHE ARREST\\n\\n\\nTo my extreme annoyance, Poirot was not in, and the old Belgian who\\nanswered my knock informed me that he believed he had gone to London.\\n\\nI was dumbfounded. What on earth could Poirot be doing in London! Was\\nit a sudden decision on his part, or had he already made up his mind\\nwhen he parted from me a few hours earlier?\\n\\nI retraced my steps to Styles in some annoyance. With Poirot away, I\\nwas uncertain how to act. Had he foreseen this arrest? Had he not, in\\nall probability, been the cause of it? Those questions I could not\\nresolve. But in the meantime what was I to do? Should I announce the\\narrest openly at Styles, or not? Though I did not acknowledge it to\\nmyself, the thought of Mary Cavendish was weighing on me. Would it not\\nbe a terrible shock to her? For the moment, I set aside utterly any\\nsuspicions of her. She could not be implicated—otherwise I should have\\nheard some hint of it.\\n\\nOf course, there was no possibility of being able permanently to\\nconceal Dr. Bauerstein’s arrest from her. It would be announced in\\nevery newspaper on the morrow. Still, I shrank from blurting it out. If\\nonly Poirot had been accessible, I could have asked his advice. What\\npossessed him to go posting off to London in this unaccountable way?\\n\\nIn spite of myself, my opinion of his sagacity was immeasurably\\nheightened. I would never have dreamt of suspecting the doctor, had not\\nPoirot put it into my head. Yes, decidedly, the little man was clever.\\n\\nAfter some reflecting, I decided to take John into my confidence, and\\nleave him to make the matter public or not, as he thought fit.\\n\\nHe gave vent to a prodigious whistle, as I imparted the news.\\n\\n“Great Scott! You _were_ right, then. I couldn’t believe it at the\\ntime.”\\n\\n“No, it is astonishing until you get used to the idea, and see how it\\nmakes everything fit in. Now, what are we to do? Of course, it will be\\ngenerally known to-morrow.”\\n\\nJohn reflected.\\n\\n“Never mind,” he said at last, “we won’t say anything at present. There\\nis no need. As you say, it will be known soon enough.”\\n\\nBut to my intense surprise, on getting down early the next morning, and\\neagerly opening the newspapers, there was not a word about the arrest!\\nThere was a column of mere padding about “The Styles Poisoning Case,”\\nbut nothing further. It was rather inexplicable, but I supposed that,\\nfor some reason or other, Japp wished to keep it out of the papers. It\\nworried me just a little, for it suggested the possibility that there\\nmight be further arrests to come.\\n\\nAfter breakfast, I decided to go down to the village, and see if Poirot\\nhad returned yet; but, before I could start, a well-known face blocked\\none of the windows, and the well-known voice said:\\n\\n“_Bonjour, mon ami!_”\\n\\n“Poirot,” I exclaimed, with relief, and seizing him by both hands, I\\ndragged him into the room. “I was never so glad to see anyone. Listen,\\nI have said nothing to anybody but John. Is that right?”\\n\\n“My friend,” replied Poirot, “I do not know what you are talking\\nabout.”\\n\\n“Dr. Bauerstein’s arrest, of course,” I answered impatiently.\\n\\n“Is Bauerstein arrested, then?”\\n\\n“Did you not know it?”\\n\\n“Not the least in the world.” But, pausing a moment, he added: “Still,\\nit does not surprise me. After all, we are only four miles from the\\ncoast.”\\n\\n“The coast?” I asked, puzzled. “What has that got to do with it?”\\n\\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n“Surely, it is obvious!”\\n\\n“Not to me. No doubt I am very dense, but I cannot see what the\\nproximity of the coast has got to do with the murder of Mrs.\\nInglethorp.”\\n\\n“Nothing at all, of course,” replied Poirot, smiling. “But we were\\nspeaking of the arrest of Dr. Bauerstein.”\\n\\n“Well, he is arrested for the murder of Mrs. Inglethorp——”\\n\\n“What?” cried Poirot, in apparently lively astonishment. “Dr.\\nBauerstein arrested for the murder of Mrs. Inglethorp?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“Impossible! That would be too good a farce! Who told you that, my\\nfriend?”\\n\\n“Well, no one exactly told me,” I confessed. “But he is arrested.”\\n\\n“Oh, yes, very likely. But for espionage, _mon ami_.”\\n\\n“Espionage?” I gasped.\\n\\n“Precisely.”\\n\\n“Not for poisoning Mrs. Inglethorp?”\\n\\n“Not unless our friend Japp has taken leave of his senses,” replied\\nPoirot placidly.\\n\\n“But—but I thought you thought so too?”\\n\\nPoirot gave me one look, which conveyed a wondering pity, and his full\\nsense of the utter absurdity of such an idea.\\n\\n“Do you mean to say,” I asked, slowly adapting myself to the new idea,\\n“that Dr. Bauerstein is a spy?”\\n\\nPoirot nodded.\\n\\n“Have you never suspected it?”\\n\\n“It never entered my head.”\\n\\n“It did not strike you as peculiar that a famous London doctor should\\nbury himself in a little village like this, and should be in the habit\\nof walking about at all hours of the night, fully dressed?”\\n\\n“No,” I confessed, “I never thought of such a thing.”\\n\\n“He is, of course, a German by birth,” said Poirot thoughtfully,\\n“though he has practised so long in this country that nobody thinks of\\nhim as anything but an Englishman. He was naturalized about fifteen\\nyears ago. A very clever man—a Jew, of course.”\\n\\n“The blackguard!” I cried indignantly.\\n\\n“Not at all. He is, on the contrary, a patriot. Think what he stands to\\nlose. I admire the man myself.”\\n\\nBut I could not look at it in Poirot’s philosophical way.\\n\\n“And this is the man with whom Mrs. Cavendish has been wandering about\\nall over the country!” I cried indignantly.\\n\\n“Yes. I should fancy he had found her very useful,” remarked Poirot.\\n“So long as gossip busied itself in coupling their names together, any\\nother vagaries of the doctor’s passed unobserved.”\\n\\n“Then you think he never really cared for her?” I asked eagerly—rather\\ntoo eagerly, perhaps, under the circumstances.\\n\\n“That, of course, I cannot say, but—shall I tell you my own private\\nopinion, Hastings?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“Well, it is this: that Mrs. Cavendish does not care, and never has\\ncared one little jot about Dr. Bauerstein!”\\n\\n“Do you really think so?” I could not disguise my pleasure.\\n\\n“I am quite sure of it. And I will tell you why.”\\n\\n“Yes?”\\n\\n“Because she cares for someone else, _mon ami_.”\\n\\n“Oh!” What did he mean? In spite of myself, an agreeable warmth spread\\nover me. I am not a vain man where women are concerned, but I\\nremembered certain evidences, too lightly thought of at the time,\\nperhaps, but which certainly seemed to indicate——\\n\\nMy pleasing thoughts were interrupted by the sudden entrance of Miss\\nHoward. She glanced round hastily to make sure there was no one else in\\nthe room, and quickly produced an old sheet of brown paper. This she\\nhanded to Poirot, murmuring as she did so the cryptic words:\\n\\n“On top of the wardrobe.” Then she hurriedly left the room.\\n\\nPoirot unfolded the sheet of paper eagerly, and uttered an exclamation\\nof satisfaction. He spread it out on the table.\\n\\n“Come here, Hastings. Now tell me, what is that initial—J. or L.?”\\n\\nIt was a medium sized sheet of paper, rather dusty, as though it had\\nlain by for some time. But it was the label that was attracting\\nPoirot’s attention. At the top, it bore the printed stamp of Messrs.\\nParkson’s, the well-known theatrical costumiers, and it was addressed\\nto “—(the debatable initial) Cavendish, Esq., Styles Court, Styles St.\\nMary, Essex.”\\n\\n“It might be T., or it might be L.,” I said, after studying the thing\\nfor a minute or two. “It certainly isn’t a J.”\\n\\n“Good,” replied Poirot, folding up the paper again. “I, also, am of\\nyour way of thinking. It is an L., depend upon it!”\\n\\n“Where did it come from?” I asked curiously. “Is it important?”\\n\\n“Moderately so. It confirms a surmise of mine. Having deduced its\\nexistence, I set Miss Howard to search for it, and, as you see, she has\\nbeen successful.”\\n\\n“What did she mean by ‘On the top of the wardrobe’?”\\n\\n“She meant,” replied Poirot promptly, “that she found it on top of a\\nwardrobe.”\\n\\n“A funny place for a piece of brown paper,” I mused.\\n\\n“Not at all. The top of a wardrobe is an excellent place for brown\\npaper and cardboard boxes. I have kept them there myself. Neatly\\narranged, there is nothing to offend the eye.”\\n\\n“Poirot,” I asked earnestly, “have you made up your mind about this\\ncrime?”\\n\\n“Yes—that is to say, I believe I know how it was committed.”\\n\\n“Ah!”\\n\\n“Unfortunately, I have no proof beyond my surmise, unless——” With\\nsudden energy, he caught me by the arm, and whirled me down the hall,\\ncalling out in French in his excitement: “Mademoiselle Dorcas,\\nMademoiselle Dorcas, _un moment, s’il vous plaît!_”\\n\\nDorcas, quite flurried by the noise, came hurrying out of the pantry.\\n\\n“My good Dorcas, I have an idea—a little idea—if it should prove\\njustified, what magnificent chance! Tell me, on Monday, not Tuesday,\\nDorcas, but Monday, the day before the tragedy, did anything go wrong\\nwith Mrs. Inglethorp’s bell?”\\n\\nDorcas looked very surprised.\\n\\n“Yes, sir, now you mention it, it did; though I don’t know how you came\\nto hear of it. A mouse, or some such, must have nibbled the wire\\nthrough. The man came and put it right on Tuesday morning.”\\n\\nWith a long drawn exclamation of ecstasy, Poirot led the way back to\\nthe morning-room.\\n\\n“See you, one should not ask for outside proof—no, reason should be\\nenough. But the flesh is weak, it is consolation to find that one is on\\nthe right track. Ah, my friend, I am like a giant refreshed. I run! I\\nleap!”\\n\\nAnd, in very truth, run and leap he did, gambolling wildly down the\\nstretch of lawn outside the long window.\\n\\n“What is your remarkable little friend doing?” asked a voice behind me,\\nand I turned to find Mary Cavendish at my elbow. She smiled, and so did\\nI. “What is it all about?”\\n\\n“Really, I can’t tell you. He asked Dorcas some question about a bell,\\nand appeared so delighted with her answer that he is capering about as\\nyou see!”\\n\\nMary laughed.\\n\\n“How ridiculous! He’s going out of the gate. Isn’t he coming back\\nto-day?”\\n\\n“I don’t know. I’ve given up trying to guess what he’ll do next.”\\n\\n“Is he quite mad, Mr. Hastings?”\\n\\n“I honestly don’t know. Sometimes, I feel sure he is as mad as a\\nhatter; and then, just as he is at his maddest, I find there is method\\nin his madness.”\\n\\n“I see.”\\n\\nIn spite of her laugh, Mary was looking thoughtful this morning. She\\nseemed grave, almost sad.\\n\\nIt occurred to me that it would be a good opportunity to tackle her on\\nthe subject of Cynthia. I began rather tactfully, _I_ thought, but I\\nhad not gone far before she stopped me authoritatively.\\n\\n“You are an excellent advocate, I have no doubt, Mr. Hastings, but in\\nthis case your talents are quite thrown away. Cynthia will run no risk\\nof encountering any unkindness from me.”\\n\\nI began to stammer feebly that I hoped she hadn’t thought—— But again\\nshe stopped me, and her words were so unexpected that they quite drove\\nCynthia, and her troubles, out of my mind.\\n\\n“Mr. Hastings,” she said, “do you think I and my husband are happy\\ntogether?”\\n\\nI was considerably taken aback, and murmured something about it’s not\\nbeing my business to think anything of the sort.\\n\\n“Well,” she said quietly, “whether it is your business or not, I will\\ntell you that we are _not_ happy.”\\n\\nI said nothing, for I saw that she had not finished.\\n\\nShe began slowly, walking up and down the room, her head a little bent,\\nand that slim, supple figure of hers swaying gently as she walked. She\\nstopped suddenly, and looked up at me.\\n\\n“You don’t know anything about me, do you?” she asked. “Where I come\\nfrom, who I was before I married John—anything, in fact? Well, I will\\ntell you. I will make a father confessor of you. You are kind, I\\nthink—yes, I am sure you are kind.”\\n\\nSomehow, I was not quite as elated as I might have been. I remembered\\nthat Cynthia had begun her confidences in much the same way. Besides, a\\nfather confessor should be elderly, it is not at all the role for a\\nyoung man.\\n\\n“My father was English,” said Mrs. Cavendish, “but my mother was a\\nRussian.”\\n\\n“Ah,” I said, “now I understand——”\\n\\n“Understand what?”\\n\\n“A hint of something foreign—different—that there has always been about\\nyou.”\\n\\n“My mother was very beautiful, I believe. I don’t know, because I never\\nsaw her. She died when I was quite a little child. I believe there was\\nsome tragedy connected with her death—she took an overdose of some\\nsleeping draught by mistake. However that may be, my father was\\nbroken-hearted. Shortly afterwards, he went into the Consular Service.\\nEverywhere he went, I went with him. When I was twenty-three, I had\\nbeen nearly all over the world. It was a splendid life—I loved it.”\\n\\nThere was a smile on her face, and her head was thrown back. She seemed\\nliving in the memory of those old glad days.\\n\\n“Then my father died. He left me very badly off. I had to go and live\\nwith some old aunts in Yorkshire.” She shuddered. “You will understand\\nme when I say that it was a deadly life for a girl brought up as I had\\nbeen. The narrowness, the deadly monotony of it, almost drove me mad.”\\nShe paused a minute, and added in a different tone: “And then I met\\nJohn Cavendish.”\\n\\n“Yes?”\\n\\n“You can imagine that, from my aunts’ point of view, it was a very good\\nmatch for me. But I can honestly say it was not this fact which weighed\\nwith me. No, he was simply a way of escape from the insufferable\\nmonotony of my life.”\\n\\nI said nothing, and after a moment, she went on:\\n\\n“Don’t misunderstand me. I was quite honest with him. I told him, what\\nwas true, that I liked him very much, that I hoped to come to like him\\nmore, but that I was not in any way what the world calls ‘in love’ with\\nhim. He declared that that satisfied him, and so—we were married.”\\n\\nShe waited a long time, a little frown had gathered on her forehead.\\nShe seemed to be looking back earnestly into those past days.\\n\\n“I think—I am sure—he cared for me at first. But I suppose we were not\\nwell matched. Almost at once, we drifted apart. He—it is not a pleasing\\nthing for my pride, but it is the truth—tired of me very soon.” I must\\nhave made some murmur of dissent, for she went on quickly: “Oh, yes, he\\ndid! Not that it matters now—now that we’ve come to the parting of the\\nways.”\\n\\n“What do you mean?”\\n\\nShe answered quietly:\\n\\n“I mean that I am not going to remain at Styles.”\\n\\n“You and John are not going to live here?”\\n\\n“John may live here, but I shall not.”\\n\\n“You are going to leave him?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“But why?”\\n\\nShe paused a long time, and said at last:\\n\\n“Perhaps—because I want to be—free!”\\n\\nAnd, as she spoke, I had a sudden vision of broad spaces, virgin tracts\\nof forests, untrodden lands—and a realization of what freedom would\\nmean to such a nature as Mary Cavendish. I seemed to see her for a\\nmoment as she was, a proud wild creature, as untamed by civilization as\\nsome shy bird of the hills. A little cry broke from her lips:\\n\\n“You don’t know, you don’t know, how this hateful place has been prison\\nto me!”\\n\\n“I understand,” I said, “but—but don’t do anything rash.”\\n\\n“Oh, rash!” Her voice mocked at my prudence.\\n\\nThen suddenly I said a thing I could have bitten out my tongue for:\\n\\n“You know that Dr. Bauerstein has been arrested?”\\n\\nAn instant coldness passed like a mask over her face, blotting out all\\nexpression.\\n\\n“John was so kind as to break that to me this morning.”\\n\\n“Well, what do you think?” I asked feebly.\\n\\n“Of what?”\\n\\n“Of the arrest?”\\n\\n“What should I think? Apparently he is a German spy; so the gardener\\nhad told John.”\\n\\nHer face and voice were absolutely cold and expressionless. Did she\\ncare, or did she not?\\n\\nShe moved away a step or two, and fingered one of the flower vases.\\n\\n“These are quite dead. I must do them again. Would you mind\\nmoving—thank you, Mr. Hastings.” And she walked quietly past me out of\\nthe window, with a cool little nod of dismissal.\\n\\nNo, surely she could not care for Bauerstein. No woman could act her\\npart with that icy unconcern.\\n\\nPoirot did not make his appearance the following morning, and there was\\nno sign of the Scotland Yard men.\\n\\nBut, at lunch-time, there arrived a new piece of evidence—or rather\\nlack of evidence. We had vainly tried to trace the fourth letter, which\\nMrs. Inglethorp had written on the evening preceding her death. Our\\nefforts having been in vain, we had abandoned the matter, hoping that\\nit might turn up of itself one day. And this is just what did happen,\\nin the shape of a communication, which arrived by the second post from\\na firm of French music publishers, acknowledging Mrs. Inglethorp’s\\ncheque, and regretting they had been unable to trace a certain series\\nof Russian folksongs. So the last hope of solving the mystery, by means\\nof Mrs. Inglethorp’s correspondence on the fatal evening, had to be\\nabandoned.\\n\\nJust before tea, I strolled down to tell Poirot of the new\\ndisappointment, but found, to my annoyance, that he was once more out.\\n\\n“Gone to London again?”\\n\\n“Oh, no, monsieur, he has but taken the train to Tadminster. ‘To see a\\nyoung lady’s dispensary,’ he said.”\\n\\n“Silly ass!” I ejaculated. “I told him Wednesday was the one day she\\nwasn’t there! Well, tell him to look us up to-morrow morning, will\\nyou?”\\n\\n“Certainly, monsieur.”\\n\\nBut, on the following day, no sign of Poirot. I was getting angry. He\\nwas really treating us in the most cavalier fashion.\\n\\nAfter lunch, Lawrence drew me aside, and asked if I was going down to\\nsee him.\\n\\n“No, I don’t think I shall. He can come up here if he wants to see us.”\\n\\n“Oh!” Lawrence looked indeterminate. Something unusually nervous and\\nexcited in his manner roused my curiosity.\\n\\n“What is it?” I asked. “I could go if there’s anything special.”\\n\\n“It’s nothing much, but—well, if you are going, will you tell him——” he\\ndropped his voice to a whisper—“I think I’ve found the extra\\ncoffee-cup!”\\n\\nI had almost forgotten that enigmatical message of Poirot’s, but now my\\ncuriosity was aroused afresh.\\n\\nLawrence would say no more, so I decided that I would descend from my\\nhigh horse, and once more seek out Poirot at Leastways Cottage.\\n\\nThis time I was received with a smile. Monsieur Poirot was within.\\nWould I mount? I mounted accordingly.\\n\\nPoirot was sitting by the table, his head buried in his hands. He\\nsprang up at my entrance.\\n\\n“What is it?” I asked solicitously. “You are not ill, I trust?”\\n\\n“No, no, not ill. But I decide an affair of great moment.”\\n\\n“Whether to catch the criminal or not?” I asked facetiously.\\n\\nBut, to my great surprise, Poirot nodded gravely.\\n\\n“‘To speak or not to speak,’ as your so great Shakespeare says, ‘that\\nis the question.’”\\n\\nI did not trouble to correct the quotation.\\n\\n“You are not serious, Poirot?”\\n\\n“I am of the most serious. For the most serious of all things hangs in\\nthe balance.”\\n\\n“And that is?”\\n\\n“A woman’s happiness, _mon ami_,” he said gravely.\\n\\nI did not quite know what to say.\\n\\n“The moment has come,” said Poirot thoughtfully, “and I do not know\\nwhat to do. For, see you, it is a big stake for which I play. No one\\nbut I, Hercule Poirot, would attempt it!” And he tapped himself proudly\\non the breast.\\n\\nAfter pausing a few minutes respectfully, so as not to spoil his\\neffect, I gave him Lawrence’s message.\\n\\n“Aha!” he cried. “So he has found the extra coffee-cup. That is good.\\nHe has more intelligence than would appear, this long-faced Monsieur\\nLawrence of yours!”\\n\\nI did not myself think very highly of Lawrence’s intelligence; but I\\nforebore to contradict Poirot, and gently took him to task for\\nforgetting my instructions as to which were Cynthia’s days off.\\n\\n“It is true. I have the head of a sieve. However, the other young lady\\nwas most kind. She was sorry for my disappointment, and showed me\\neverything in the kindest way.”\\n\\n“Oh, well, that’s all right, then, and you must go to tea with Cynthia\\nanother day.”\\n\\nI told him about the letter.\\n\\n“I am sorry for that,” he said. “I always had hopes of that letter. But\\nno, it was not to be. This affair must all be unravelled from within.”\\nHe tapped his forehead. “These little grey cells. It is ‘up to them’—as\\nyou say over here.” Then, suddenly, he asked: “Are you a judge of\\nfinger-marks, my friend?”\\n\\n“No,” I said, rather surprised, “I know that there are no two\\nfinger-marks alike, but that’s as far as my science goes.”\\n\\n“Exactly.”\\n\\nHe unlocked a little drawer, and took out some photographs which he\\nlaid on the table.\\n\\n“I have numbered them, 1, 2, 3. Will you describe them to me?”\\n\\nI studied the proofs attentively.\\n\\n“All greatly magnified, I see. No. 1, I should say, are a man’s\\nfinger-prints; thumb and first finger. No. 2 are a lady’s; they are\\nmuch smaller, and quite different in every way. No. 3”—I paused for\\nsome time—“there seem to be a lot of confused finger-marks, but here,\\nvery distinctly, are No. 1’s.”\\n\\n“Overlapping the others?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“You recognize them beyond fail?”\\n\\n“Oh, yes; they are identical.”\\n\\nPoirot nodded, and gently taking the photographs from me locked them up\\nagain.\\n\\n“I suppose,” I said, “that as usual, you are not going to explain?”\\n\\n“On the contrary. No. 1 were the finger-prints of Monsieur Lawrence.\\nNo. 2 were those of Mademoiselle Cynthia. They are not important. I\\nmerely obtained them for comparison. No. 3 is a little more\\ncomplicated.”\\n\\n“Yes?”\\n\\n“It is, as you see, highly magnified. You may have noticed a sort of\\nblur extending all across the picture. I will not describe to you the\\nspecial apparatus, dusting powder, etc., which I used. It is a\\nwell-known process to the police, and by means of it you can obtain a\\nphotograph of the finger-prints of any object in a very short space of\\ntime. Well, my friend, you have seen the finger-marks—it remains to\\ntell you the particular object on which they had been left.”\\n\\n“Go on—I am really excited.”\\n\\n“_Eh bien!_ Photo No. 3 represents the highly magnified surface of a\\ntiny bottle in the top poison cupboard of the dispensary in the Red\\nCross Hospital at Tadminster—which sounds like the house that Jack\\nbuilt!”\\n\\n“Good heavens!” I exclaimed. “But what were Lawrence Cavendish’s\\nfinger-marks doing on it? He never went near the poison cupboard the\\nday we were there!”\\n\\n“Oh, yes, he did!”\\n\\n“Impossible! We were all together the whole time.”\\n\\nPoirot shook his head.\\n\\n“No, my friend, there was a moment when you were not all together.\\nThere was a moment when you could not have been all together, or it\\nwould not have been necessary to call to Monsieur Lawrence to come and\\njoin you on the balcony.”\\n\\n“I’d forgotten that,” I admitted. “But it was only for a moment.”\\n\\n“Long enough.”\\n\\n“Long enough for what?”\\n\\nPoirot’s smile became rather enigmatical.\\n\\n“Long enough for a gentleman who had once studied medicine to gratify a\\nvery natural interest and curiosity.”\\n\\nOur eyes met. Poirot’s were pleasantly vague. He got up and hummed a\\nlittle tune. I watched him suspiciously.\\n\\n“Poirot,” I said, “what was in this particular little bottle?”\\n\\nPoirot looked out of the window.\\n\\n“Hydro-chloride of strychnine,” he said, over his shoulder, continuing\\nto hum.\\n\\n“Good heavens!” I said it quite quietly. I was not surprised. I had\\nexpected that answer.\\n\\n“They use the pure hydro-chloride of strychnine very little—only\\noccasionally for pills. It is the official solution, Liq. Strychnine\\nHydro-clor. that is used in most medicines. That is why the\\nfinger-marks have remained undisturbed since then.”\\n\\n“How did you manage to take this photograph?”\\n\\n“I dropped my hat from the balcony,” explained Poirot simply. “Visitors\\nwere not permitted below at that hour, so, in spite of my many\\napologies, Mademoiselle Cynthia’s colleague had to go down and fetch it\\nfor me.”\\n\\n“Then you knew what you were going to find?”\\n\\n“No, not at all. I merely realized that it was possible, from your\\nstory, for Monsieur Lawrence to go to the poison cupboard. The\\npossibility had to be confirmed, or eliminated.”\\n\\n“Poirot,” I said, “your gaiety does not deceive me. This is a very\\nimportant discovery.”\\n\\n“I do not know,” said Poirot. “But one thing does strike me. No doubt\\nit has struck you too.”\\n\\n“What is that?”\\n\\n“Why, that there is altogether too much strychnine about this case.\\nThis is the third time we run up against it. There was strychnine in\\nMrs. Inglethorp’s tonic. There is the strychnine sold across the\\ncounter at Styles St. Mary by Mace. Now we have more strychnine,\\nhandled by one of the household. It is confusing; and, as you know, I\\ndo not like confusion.”\\n\\nBefore I could reply, one of the other Belgians opened the door and\\nstuck his head in.\\n\\n“There is a lady below, asking for Mr Hastings.”\\n\\n“A lady?”\\n\\nI jumped up. Poirot followed me down the narrow stairs. Mary Cavendish\\nwas standing in the doorway.\\n\\n“I have been visiting an old woman in the village,” she explained, “and\\nas Lawrence told me you were with Monsieur Poirot I thought I would\\ncall for you.”\\n\\n“Alas, madame,” said Poirot, “I thought you had come to honour me with\\na visit!”\\n\\n“I will some day, if you ask me,” she promised him, smiling.\\n\\n“That is well. If you should need a father confessor, madame”—she\\nstarted ever so slightly—“remember, Papa Poirot is always at your\\nservice.”\\n\\nShe stared at him for a few minutes, as though seeking to read some\\ndeeper meaning into his words. Then she turned abruptly away.\\n\\n“Come, will you not walk back with us too, Monsieur Poirot?”\\n\\n“Enchanted, madame.”\\n\\nAll the way to Styles, Mary talked fast and feverishly. It struck me\\nthat in some way she was nervous of Poirot’s eyes.\\n\\nThe weather had broken, and the sharp wind was almost autumnal in its\\nshrewishness. Mary shivered a little, and buttoned her black sports\\ncoat closer. The wind through the trees made a mournful noise, like\\nsome great giant sighing.\\n\\nWe walked up to the great door of Styles, and at once the knowledge\\ncame to us that something was wrong.\\n\\nDorcas came running out to meet us. She was crying and wringing her\\nhands. I was aware of other servants huddled together in the\\nbackground, all eyes and ears.\\n\\n“Oh, m’am! Oh, m’am! I don’t know how to tell you——”\\n\\n“What is it, Dorcas?” I asked impatiently. “Tell us at once.”\\n\\n“It’s those wicked detectives. They’ve arrested him—they’ve arrested\\nMr. Cavendish!”\\n\\n“Arrested Lawrence?” I gasped.\\n\\nI saw a strange look come into Dorcas’s eyes.\\n\\n“No, sir. Not Mr. Lawrence—Mr. John.”\\n\\nBehind me, with a wild cry, Mary Cavendish fell heavily against me, and\\nas I turned to catch her I met the quiet triumph in Poirot’s eyes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI.\\nTHE CASE FOR THE PROSECUTION\\n\\n\\nThe trial of John Cavendish for the murder of his stepmother took place\\ntwo months later.\\n\\nOf the intervening weeks I will say little, but my admiration and\\nsympathy went out unfeignedly to Mary Cavendish. She ranged herself\\npassionately on her husband’s side, scorning the mere idea of his\\nguilt, and fought for him tooth and nail.\\n\\nI expressed my admiration to Poirot, and he nodded thoughtfully.\\n\\n“Yes, she is of those women who show at their best in adversity. It\\nbrings out all that is sweetest and truest in them. Her pride and her\\njealousy have——”\\n\\n“Jealousy?” I queried.\\n\\n“Yes. Have you not realized that she is an unusually jealous woman? As\\nI was saying, her pride and jealousy have been laid aside. She thinks\\nof nothing but her husband, and the terrible fate that is hanging over\\nhim.”\\n\\nHe spoke very feelingly, and I looked at him earnestly, remembering\\nthat last afternoon, when he had been deliberating whether or not to\\nspeak. With his tenderness for “a woman’s happiness,” I felt glad that\\nthe decision had been taken out of his hands.\\n\\n“Even now,” I said, “I can hardly believe it. You see, up to the very\\nlast minute, I thought it was Lawrence!”\\n\\nPoirot grinned.\\n\\n“I know you did.”\\n\\n“But John! My old friend John!”\\n\\n“Every murderer is probably somebody’s old friend,” observed Poirot\\nphilosophically. “You cannot mix up sentiment and reason.”\\n\\n“I must say I think you might have given me a hint.”\\n\\n“Perhaps, _mon ami_, I did not do so, just because he _was_ your old\\nfriend.”\\n\\nI was rather disconcerted by this, remembering how I had busily passed\\non to John what I believed to be Poirot’s views concerning Bauerstein.\\nHe, by the way, had been acquitted of the charge brought against him.\\nNevertheless, although he had been too clever for them this time, and\\nthe charge of espionage could not be brought home to him, his wings\\nwere pretty well clipped for the future.\\n\\nI asked Poirot whether he thought John would be condemned. To my\\nintense surprise, he replied that, on the contrary, he was extremely\\nlikely to be acquitted.\\n\\n“But, Poirot——” I protested.\\n\\n“Oh, my friend, have I not said to you all along that I have no proofs.\\nIt is one thing to know that a man is guilty, it is quite another\\nmatter to prove him so. And, in this case, there is terribly little\\nevidence. That is the whole trouble. I, Hercule Poirot, know, but I\\nlack the last link in my chain. And unless I can find that missing\\nlink——” He shook his head gravely.\\n\\n“When did you first suspect John Cavendish?” I asked, after a minute or\\ntwo.\\n\\n“Did you not suspect him at all?”\\n\\n“No, indeed.”\\n\\n“Not after that fragment of conversation you overheard between Mrs.\\nCavendish and her mother-in-law, and her subsequent lack of frankness\\nat the inquest?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“Did you not put two and two together, and reflect that if it was not\\nAlfred Inglethorp who was quarrelling with his wife—and you remember,\\nhe strenuously denied it at the inquest—it must be either Lawrence or\\nJohn. Now, if it was Lawrence, Mary Cavendish’s conduct was just as\\ninexplicable. But if, on the other hand, it was John, the whole thing\\nwas explained quite naturally.”\\n\\n“So,” I cried, a light breaking in upon me, “it was John who quarrelled\\nwith his mother that afternoon?”\\n\\n“Exactly.”\\n\\n“And you have known this all along?”\\n\\n“Certainly. Mrs. Cavendish’s behaviour could only be explained that\\nway.”\\n\\n“And yet you say he may be acquitted?”\\n\\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n“Certainly I do. At the police court proceedings, we shall hear the\\ncase for the prosecution, but in all probability his solicitors will\\nadvise him to reserve his defence. That will be sprung upon us at the\\ntrial. And—ah, by the way, I have a word of caution to give you, my\\nfriend. I must not appear in the case.”\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“No. Officially, I have nothing to do with it. Until I have found that\\nlast link in my chain, I must remain behind the scenes. Mrs. Cavendish\\nmust think I am working for her husband, not against him.”\\n\\n“I say, that’s playing it a bit low down,” I protested.\\n\\n“Not at all. We have to deal with a most clever and unscrupulous man,\\nand we must use any means in our power—otherwise he will slip through\\nour fingers. That is why I have been careful to remain in the\\nbackground. All the discoveries have been made by Japp, and Japp will\\ntake all the credit. If I am called upon to give evidence at all”—he\\nsmiled broadly—“it will probably be as a witness for the defence.”\\n\\nI could hardly believe my ears.\\n\\n“It is quite _en règle_,” continued Poirot. “Strangely enough, I can\\ngive evidence that will demolish one contention of the prosecution.”\\n\\n“Which one?”\\n\\n“The one that relates to the destruction of the will. John Cavendish\\ndid not destroy that will.”\\n\\nPoirot was a true prophet. I will not go into the details of the police\\ncourt proceedings, as it involves many tiresome repetitions. I will\\nmerely state baldly that John Cavendish reserved his defence, and was\\nduly committed for trial.\\n\\nSeptember found us all in London. Mary took a house in Kensington,\\nPoirot being included in the family party.\\n\\nI myself had been given a job at the War Office, so was able to see\\nthem continually.\\n\\nAs the weeks went by, the state of Poirot’s nerves grew worse and\\nworse. That “last link” he talked about was still lacking. Privately, I\\nhoped it might remain so, for what happiness could there be for Mary,\\nif John were not acquitted?\\n\\nOn September 15th John Cavendish appeared in the dock at the Old\\nBailey, charged with “The Wilful Murder of Emily Agnes Inglethorp,” and\\npleaded “Not Guilty.”\\n\\nSir Ernest Heavywether, the famous K.C., had been engaged to defend\\nhim.\\n\\nMr. Philips, K.C., opened the case for the Crown.\\n\\nThe murder, he said, was a most premeditated and cold-blooded one. It\\nwas neither more nor less than the deliberate poisoning of a fond and\\ntrusting woman by the stepson to whom she had been more than a mother.\\nEver since his boyhood, she had supported him. He and his wife had\\nlived at Styles Court in every luxury, surrounded by her care and\\nattention. She had been their kind and generous benefactress.\\n\\nHe proposed to call witnesses to show how the prisoner, a profligate\\nand spendthrift, had been at the end of his financial tether, and had\\nalso been carrying on an intrigue with a certain Mrs. Raikes, a\\nneighbouring farmer’s wife. This having come to his stepmother’s ears,\\nshe taxed him with it on the afternoon before her death, and a quarrel\\nensued, part of which was overheard. On the previous day, the prisoner\\nhad purchased strychnine at the village chemist’s shop, wearing a\\ndisguise by means of which he hoped to throw the onus of the crime upon\\nanother man—to wit, Mrs. Inglethorp’s husband, of whom he had been\\nbitterly jealous. Luckily for Mr. Inglethorp, he had been able to\\nproduce an unimpeachable alibi.\\n\\nOn the afternoon of July 17th, continued Counsel, immediately after the\\nquarrel with her son, Mrs. Inglethorp made a new will. This will was\\nfound destroyed in the grate of her bedroom the following morning, but\\nevidence had come to light which showed that it had been drawn up in\\nfavour of her husband. Deceased had already made a will in his favour\\nbefore her marriage, but—and Mr. Philips wagged an expressive\\nforefinger—the prisoner was not aware of that. What had induced the\\ndeceased to make a fresh will, with the old one still extant, he could\\nnot say. She was an old lady, and might possibly have forgotten the\\nformer one; or—this seemed to him more likely—she may have had an idea\\nthat it was revoked by her marriage, as there had been some\\nconversation on the subject. Ladies were not always very well versed in\\nlegal knowledge. She had, about a year before, executed a will in\\nfavour of the prisoner. He would call evidence to show that it was the\\nprisoner who ultimately handed his stepmother her coffee on the fatal\\nnight. Later in the evening, he had sought admission to her room, on\\nwhich occasion, no doubt, he found an opportunity of destroying the\\nwill which, as far as he knew, would render the one in his favour\\nvalid.\\n\\nThe prisoner had been arrested in consequence of the discovery, in his\\nroom, by Detective Inspector Japp—a most brilliant officer—of the\\nidentical phial of strychnine which had been sold at the village\\nchemist’s to the supposed Mr. Inglethorp on the day before the murder.\\nIt would be for the jury to decide whether or not these damning facts\\nconstituted an overwhelming proof of the prisoner’s guilt.\\n\\nAnd, subtly implying that a jury which did not so decide, was quite\\nunthinkable, Mr. Philips sat down and wiped his forehead.\\n\\nThe first witnesses for the prosecution were mostly those who had been\\ncalled at the inquest, the medical evidence being again taken first.\\n\\nSir Ernest Heavywether, who was famous all over England for the\\nunscrupulous manner in which he bullied witnesses, only asked two\\nquestions.\\n\\n“I take it, Dr. Bauerstein, that strychnine, as a drug, acts quickly?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“And that you are unable to account for the delay in this case?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“Thank you.”\\n\\nMr. Mace identified the phial handed him by Counsel as that sold by him\\nto “Mr. Inglethorp.” Pressed, he admitted that he only knew Mr.\\nInglethorp by sight. He had never spoken to him. The witness was not\\ncross-examined.\\n\\nAlfred Inglethorp was called, and denied having purchased the poison.\\nHe also denied having quarrelled with his wife. Various witnesses\\ntestified to the accuracy of these statements.\\n\\nThe gardeners’ evidence, as to the witnessing of the will was taken,\\nand then Dorcas was called.\\n\\nDorcas, faithful to her “young gentlemen,” denied strenuously that it\\ncould have been John’s voice she heard, and resolutely declared, in the\\nteeth of everything, that it was Mr. Inglethorp who had been in the\\nboudoir with her mistress. A rather wistful smile passed across the\\nface of the prisoner in the dock. He knew only too well how useless her\\ngallant defiance was, since it was not the object of the defence to\\ndeny this point. Mrs. Cavendish, of course, could not be called upon to\\ngive evidence against her husband.\\n\\nAfter various questions on other matters, Mr. Philips asked:\\n\\n“In the month of June last, do you remember a parcel arriving for Mr.\\nLawrence Cavendish from Parkson’s?”\\n\\nDorcas shook her head.\\n\\n“I don’t remember, sir. It may have done, but Mr. Lawrence was away\\nfrom home part of June.”\\n\\n“In the event of a parcel arriving for him whilst he was away, what\\nwould be done with it?”\\n\\n“It would either be put in his room or sent on after him.”\\n\\n“By you?”\\n\\n“No, sir, I should leave it on the hall table. It would be Miss Howard\\nwho would attend to anything like that.”\\n\\nEvelyn Howard was called and, after being examined on other points, was\\nquestioned as to the parcel.\\n\\n“Don’t remember. Lots of parcels come. Can’t remember one special one.”\\n\\n“You do not know if it was sent after Mr. Lawrence Cavendish to Wales,\\nor whether it was put in his room?”\\n\\n“Don’t think it was sent after him. Should have remembered it if it\\nwas.”\\n\\n“Supposing a parcel arrived addressed to Mr. Lawrence Cavendish, and\\nafterwards it disappeared, should you remark its absence?”\\n\\n“No, don’t think so. I should think someone had taken charge of it.”\\n\\n“I believe, Miss Howard, that it was you who found this sheet of brown\\npaper?” He held up the same dusty piece which Poirot and I had examined\\nin the morning-room at Styles.\\n\\n“Yes, I did.”\\n\\n“How did you come to look for it?”\\n\\n“The Belgian detective who was employed on the case asked me to search\\nfor it.”\\n\\n“Where did you eventually discover it?”\\n\\n“On the top of—of—a wardrobe.”\\n\\n“On top of the prisoner’s wardrobe?”\\n\\n“I—I believe so.”\\n\\n“Did you not find it yourself?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“Then you must know where you found it?”\\n\\n“Yes, it was on the prisoner’s wardrobe.”\\n\\n“That is better.”\\n\\nAn assistant from Parkson’s, Theatrical Costumiers, testified that on\\nJune 29th, they had supplied a black beard to Mr. L. Cavendish, as\\nrequested. It was ordered by letter, and a postal order was enclosed.\\nNo, they had not kept the letter. All transactions were entered in\\ntheir books. They had sent the beard, as directed, to “L. Cavendish,\\nEsq., Styles Court.”\\n\\nSir Ernest Heavywether rose ponderously.\\n\\n“Where was the letter written from?”\\n\\n“From Styles Court.”\\n\\n“The same address to which you sent the parcel?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“And the letter came from there?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\nLike a beast of prey, Heavywether fell upon him:\\n\\n“How do you know?”\\n\\n“I—I don’t understand.”\\n\\n“How do you know that letter came from Styles? Did you notice the\\npostmark?”\\n\\n“No—but——”\\n\\n“Ah, you did _not_ notice the postmark! And yet you affirm so\\nconfidently that it came from Styles. It might, in fact, have been any\\npostmark?”\\n\\n“Y—es.”\\n\\n“In fact, the letter, though written on stamped notepaper, might have\\nbeen posted from anywhere? From Wales, for instance?”\\n\\nThe witness admitted that such might be the case, and Sir Ernest\\nsignified that he was satisfied.\\n\\nElizabeth Wells, second housemaid at Styles, stated that after she had\\ngone to bed she remembered that she had bolted the front door, instead\\nof leaving it on the latch as Mr. Inglethorp had requested. She had\\naccordingly gone downstairs again to rectify her error. Hearing a\\nslight noise in the West wing, she had peeped along the passage, and\\nhad seen Mr. John Cavendish knocking at Mrs. Inglethorp’s door.\\n\\nSir Ernest Heavywether made short work of her, and under his unmerciful\\nbullying she contradicted herself hopelessly, and Sir Ernest sat down\\nagain with a satisfied smile on his face.\\n\\nWith the evidence of Annie, as to the candle grease on the floor, and\\nas to seeing the prisoner take the coffee into the boudoir, the\\nproceedings were adjourned until the following day.\\n\\nAs we went home, Mary Cavendish spoke bitterly against the prosecuting\\ncounsel.\\n\\n“That hateful man! What a net he has drawn around my poor John! How he\\ntwisted every little fact until he made it seem what it wasn’t!”\\n\\n“Well,” I said consolingly, “it will be the other way about to-morrow.”\\n\\n“Yes,” she said meditatively; then suddenly dropped her voice. “Mr.\\nHastings, you do not think—surely it could not have been Lawrence—Oh,\\nno, that could not be!”\\n\\nBut I myself was puzzled, and as soon as I was alone with Poirot I\\nasked him what he thought Sir Ernest was driving at.\\n\\n“Ah!” said Poirot appreciatively. “He is a clever man, that Sir\\nErnest.”\\n\\n“Do you think he believes Lawrence guilty?”\\n\\n“I do not think he believes or cares anything! No, what he is trying\\nfor is to create such confusion in the minds of the jury that they are\\ndivided in their opinion as to which brother did it. He is endeavouring\\nto make out that there is quite as much evidence against Lawrence as\\nagainst John—and I am not at all sure that he will not succeed.”\\n\\nDetective-inspector Japp was the first witness called when the trial\\nwas reopened, and gave his evidence succinctly and briefly. After\\nrelating the earlier events, he proceeded:\\n\\n“Acting on information received, Superintendent Summerhaye and myself\\nsearched the prisoner’s room, during his temporary absence from the\\nhouse. In his chest of drawers, hidden beneath some underclothing, we\\nfound: first, a pair of gold-rimmed pince-nez similar to those worn by\\nMr. Inglethorp”—these were exhibited—“secondly, this phial.”\\n\\nThe phial was that already recognized by the chemist’s assistant, a\\ntiny bottle of blue glass, containing a few grains of a white\\ncrystalline powder, and labelled: “Strychnine Hydro-chloride. POISON.”\\n\\nA fresh piece of evidence discovered by the detectives since the police\\ncourt proceedings was a long, almost new piece of blotting-paper. It\\nhad been found in Mrs. Inglethorp’s cheque book, and on being reversed\\nat a mirror, showed clearly the words: “. . . erything of which I die\\npossessed I leave to my beloved husband Alfred Ing...” This placed\\nbeyond question the fact that the destroyed will had been in favour of\\nthe deceased lady’s husband. Japp then produced the charred fragment of\\npaper recovered from the grate, and this, with the discovery of the\\nbeard in the attic, completed his evidence.\\n\\nBut Sir Ernest’s cross-examination was yet to come.\\n\\n“What day was it when you searched the prisoner’s room?”\\n\\n“Tuesday, the 24th of July.”\\n\\n“Exactly a week after the tragedy?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“You found these two objects, you say, in the chest of drawers. Was the\\ndrawer unlocked?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“Does it not strike you as unlikely that a man who had committed a\\ncrime should keep the evidence of it in an unlocked drawer for anyone\\nto find?”\\n\\n“He might have stowed them there in a hurry.”\\n\\n“But you have just said it was a whole week since the crime. He would\\nhave had ample time to remove them and destroy them.”\\n\\n“Perhaps.”\\n\\n“There is no perhaps about it. Would he, or would he not have had\\nplenty of time to remove and destroy them?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“Was the pile of underclothes under which the things were hidden heavy\\nor light?”\\n\\n“Heavyish.”\\n\\n“In other words, it was winter underclothing. Obviously, the prisoner\\nwould not be likely to go to that drawer?”\\n\\n“Perhaps not.”\\n\\n“Kindly answer my question. Would the prisoner, in the hottest week of\\na hot summer, be likely to go to a drawer containing winter\\nunderclothing. Yes, or no?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“In that case, is it not possible that the articles in question might\\nhave been put there by a third person, and that the prisoner was quite\\nunaware of their presence?”\\n\\n“I should not think it likely.”\\n\\n“But it is possible?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“That is all.”\\n\\nMore evidence followed. Evidence as to the financial difficulties in\\nwhich the prisoner had found himself at the end of July. Evidence as to\\nhis intrigue with Mrs. Raikes—poor Mary, that must have been bitter\\nhearing for a woman of her pride. Evelyn Howard had been right in her\\nfacts, though her animosity against Alfred Inglethorp had caused her to\\njump to the conclusion that he was the person concerned.\\n\\nLawrence Cavendish was then put into the box. In a low voice, in answer\\nto Mr. Philips’ questions, he denied having ordered anything from\\nParkson’s in June. In fact, on June 29th, he had been staying away, in\\nWales.\\n\\nInstantly, Sir Ernest’s chin was shooting pugnaciously forward.\\n\\n“You deny having ordered a black beard from Parkson’s on June 29th?”\\n\\n“I do.”\\n\\n“Ah! In the event of anything happening to your brother, who will\\ninherit Styles Court?”\\n\\nThe brutality of the question called a flush to Lawrence’s pale face.\\nThe judge gave vent to a faint murmur of disapprobation, and the\\nprisoner in the dock leant forward angrily.\\n\\nHeavywether cared nothing for his client’s anger.\\n\\n“Answer my question, if you please.”\\n\\n“I suppose,” said Lawrence quietly, “that I should.”\\n\\n“What do you mean by you ‘suppose’? Your brother has no children. You\\n_would_ inherit it, wouldn’t you?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“Ah, that’s better,” said Heavywether, with ferocious geniality. “And\\nyou’d inherit a good slice of money too, wouldn’t you?”\\n\\n“Really, Sir Ernest,” protested the judge, “these questions are not\\nrelevant.”\\n\\nSir Ernest bowed, and having shot his arrow proceeded.\\n\\n“On Tuesday, the 17th July, you went, I believe, with another guest, to\\nvisit the dispensary at the Red Cross Hospital in Tadminster?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“Did you—while you happened to be alone for a few seconds—unlock the\\npoison cupboard, and examine some of the bottles?”\\n\\n“I—I—may have done so.”\\n\\n“I put it to you that you did do so?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\nSir Ernest fairly shot the next question at him.\\n\\n“Did you examine one bottle in particular?”\\n\\n“No, I do not think so.”\\n\\n“Be careful, Mr. Cavendish. I am referring to a little bottle of\\nHydro-chloride of Strychnine.”\\n\\nLawrence was turning a sickly greenish colour.\\n\\n“N—o—I am sure I didn’t.”\\n\\n“Then how do you account for the fact that you left the unmistakable\\nimpress of your finger-prints on it?”\\n\\nThe bullying manner was highly efficacious with a nervous disposition.\\n\\n“I—I suppose I must have taken up the bottle.”\\n\\n“I suppose so too! Did you abstract any of the contents of the bottle?”\\n\\n“Certainly not.”\\n\\n“Then why did you take it up?”\\n\\n“I once studied to be a doctor. Such things naturally interest me.”\\n\\n“Ah! So poisons ‘naturally interest’ you, do they? Still, you waited to\\nbe alone before gratifying that ‘interest’ of yours?”\\n\\n“That was pure chance. If the others had been there, I should have done\\njust the same.”\\n\\n“Still, as it happens, the others were not there?”\\n\\n“No, but——”\\n\\n“In fact, during the whole afternoon, you were only alone for a couple\\nof minutes, and it happened—I say, it happened—to be during those two\\nminutes that you displayed your ‘natural interest’ in Hydro-chloride of\\nStrychnine?”\\n\\nLawrence stammered pitiably.\\n\\n“I—I——”\\n\\nWith a satisfied and expressive countenance, Sir Ernest observed:\\n\\n“I have nothing more to ask you, Mr. Cavendish.”\\n\\nThis bit of cross-examination had caused great excitement in court. The\\nheads of the many fashionably attired women present were busily laid\\ntogether, and their whispers became so loud that the judge angrily\\nthreatened to have the court cleared if there was not immediate\\nsilence.\\n\\nThere was little more evidence. The hand-writing experts were called\\nupon for their opinion of the signature of “Alfred Inglethorp” in the\\nchemist’s poison register. They all declared unanimously that it was\\ncertainly not his hand-writing, and gave it as their view that it might\\nbe that of the prisoner disguised. Cross-examined, they admitted that\\nit might be the prisoner’s hand-writing cleverly counterfeited.\\n\\nSir Ernest Heavywether’s speech in opening the case for the defence was\\nnot a long one, but it was backed by the full force of his emphatic\\nmanner. Never, he said, in the course of his long experience, had he\\nknown a charge of murder rest on slighter evidence. Not only was it\\nentirely circumstantial, but the greater part of it was practically\\nunproved. Let them take the testimony they had heard and sift it\\nimpartially. The strychnine had been found in a drawer in the\\nprisoner’s room. That drawer was an unlocked one, as he had pointed\\nout, and he submitted that there was no evidence to prove that it was\\nthe prisoner who had concealed the poison there. It was, in fact, a\\nwicked and malicious attempt on the part of some third person to fix\\nthe crime on the prisoner. The prosecution had been unable to produce a\\nshred of evidence in support of their contention that it was the\\nprisoner who ordered the black beard from Parkson’s. The quarrel which\\nhad taken place between prisoner and his stepmother was freely\\nadmitted, but both it and his financial embarrassments had been grossly\\nexaggerated.\\n\\nHis learned friend—Sir Ernest nodded carelessly at Mr. Philips—had\\nstated that if the prisoner were an innocent man, he would have come\\nforward at the inquest to explain that it was he, and not Mr.\\nInglethorp, who had been the participator in the quarrel. He thought\\nthe facts had been misrepresented. What had actually occurred was this.\\nThe prisoner, returning to the house on Tuesday evening, had been\\nauthoritatively told that there had been a violent quarrel between Mr.\\nand Mrs. Inglethorp. No suspicion had entered the prisoner’s head that\\nanyone could possibly have mistaken his voice for that of Mr.\\nInglethorp. He naturally concluded that his stepmother had had two\\nquarrels.\\n\\nThe prosecution averred that on Monday, July 16th, the prisoner had\\nentered the chemist’s shop in the village, disguised as Mr. Inglethorp.\\nThe prisoner, on the contrary, was at that time at a lonely spot called\\nMarston’s Spinney, where he had been summoned by an anonymous note,\\ncouched in blackmailing terms, and threatening to reveal certain\\nmatters to his wife unless he complied with its demands. The prisoner\\nhad, accordingly, gone to the appointed spot, and after waiting there\\nvainly for half an hour had returned home. Unfortunately, he had met\\nwith no one on the way there or back who could vouch for the truth of\\nhis story, but luckily he had kept the note, and it would be produced\\nas evidence.\\n\\nAs for the statement relating to the destruction of the will, the\\nprisoner had formerly practised at the Bar, and was perfectly well\\naware that the will made in his favour a year before was automatically\\nrevoked by his stepmother’s remarriage. He would call evidence to show\\nwho did destroy the will, and it was possible that that might open up\\nquite a new view of the case.\\n\\nFinally, he would point out to the jury that there was evidence against\\nother people besides John Cavendish. He would direct their attention to\\nthe fact that the evidence against Mr. Lawrence Cavendish was quite as\\nstrong, if not stronger than that against his brother.\\n\\nHe would now call the prisoner.\\n\\nJohn acquitted himself well in the witness-box. Under Sir Ernest’s\\nskilful handling, he told his tale credibly and well. The anonymous\\nnote received by him was produced, and handed to the jury to examine.\\nThe readiness with which he admitted his financial difficulties, and\\nthe disagreement with his stepmother, lent value to his denials.\\n\\nAt the close of his examination, he paused, and said:\\n\\n“I should like to make one thing clear. I utterly reject and disapprove\\nof Sir Ernest Heavywether’s insinuations against my brother. My\\nbrother, I am convinced, had no more to do with the crime than I have.”\\n\\nSir Ernest merely smiled, and noted with a sharp eye that John’s\\nprotest had produced a very favourable impression on the jury.\\n\\nThen the cross-examination began.\\n\\n“I understand you to say that it never entered your head that the\\nwitnesses at the inquest could possibly have mistaken your voice for\\nthat of Mr. Inglethorp. Is not that very surprising?”\\n\\n“No, I don’t think so. I was told there had been a quarrel between my\\nmother and Mr. Inglethorp, and it never occurred to me that such was\\nnot really the case.”\\n\\n“Not when the servant Dorcas repeated certain fragments of the\\nconversation—fragments which you must have recognized?”\\n\\n“I did not recognize them.”\\n\\n“Your memory must be unusually short!”\\n\\n“No, but we were both angry, and, I think, said more than we meant. I\\npaid very little attention to my mother’s actual words.”\\n\\nMr. Philips’ incredulous sniff was a triumph of forensic skill. He\\npassed on to the subject of the note.\\n\\n“You have produced this note very opportunely. Tell me, is there\\nnothing familiar about the hand-writing of it?”\\n\\n“Not that I know of.”\\n\\n“Do you not think that it bears a marked resemblance to your own\\nhand-writing—carelessly disguised?”\\n\\n“No, I do not think so.”\\n\\n“I put it to you that it is your own hand-writing!”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“I put it to you that, anxious to prove an alibi, you conceived the\\nidea of a fictitious and rather incredible appointment, and wrote this\\nnote yourself in order to bear out your statement!”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“Is it not a fact that, at the time you claim to have been waiting\\nabout at a solitary and unfrequented spot, you were really in the\\nchemist’s shop in Styles St. Mary, where you purchased strychnine in\\nthe name of Alfred Inglethorp?”\\n\\n“No, that is a lie.”\\n\\n“I put it to you that, wearing a suit of Mr. Inglethorp’s clothes, with\\na black beard trimmed to resemble his, you were there—and signed the\\nregister in his name!”\\n\\n“That is absolutely untrue.”\\n\\n“Then I will leave the remarkable similarity of hand-writing between\\nthe note, the register, and your own, to the consideration of the\\njury,” said Mr. Philips, and sat down with the air of a man who has\\ndone his duty, but who was nevertheless horrified by such deliberate\\nperjury.\\n\\nAfter this, as it was growing late, the case was adjourned till Monday.\\n\\nPoirot, I noticed, was looking profoundly discouraged. He had that\\nlittle frown between the eyes that I knew so well.\\n\\n“What is it, Poirot?” I inquired.\\n\\n“Ah, _mon ami_, things are going badly, badly.”\\n\\nIn spite of myself, my heart gave a leap of relief. Evidently there was\\na likelihood of John Cavendish being acquitted.\\n\\nWhen we reached the house, my little friend waved aside Mary’s offer of\\ntea.\\n\\n“No, I thank you, madame. I will mount to my room.”\\n\\nI followed him. Still frowning, he went across to the desk and took out\\na small pack of patience cards. Then he drew up a chair to the table,\\nand, to my utter amazement, began solemnly to build card houses!\\n\\nMy jaw dropped involuntarily, and he said at once:\\n\\n“No, _mon ami_, I am not in my second childhood! I steady my nerves,\\nthat is all. This employment requires precision of the fingers. With\\nprecision of the fingers goes precision of the brain. And never have I\\nneeded that more than now!”\\n\\n“What is the trouble?” I asked.\\n\\nWith a great thump on the table, Poirot demolished his carefully built\\nup edifice.\\n\\n“It is this, _mon ami!_ That I can build card houses seven stories\\nhigh, but I cannot”—thump—“find”—thump—“ that last link of which I\\nspoke to you.”\\n\\nI could not quite tell what to say, so I held my peace, and he began\\nslowly building up the cards again, speaking in jerks as he did so.\\n\\n“It is done—so! By placing—one card—on another—with\\nmathematical—precision!”\\n\\nI watched the card house rising under his hands, story by story. He\\nnever hesitated or faltered. It was really almost like a conjuring\\ntrick.\\n\\n“What a steady hand you’ve got,” I remarked. “I believe I’ve only seen\\nyour hand shake once.”\\n\\n“On an occasion when I was enraged, without doubt,” observed Poirot,\\nwith great placidity.\\n\\n“Yes indeed! You were in a towering rage. Do you remember? It was when\\nyou discovered that the lock of the despatch-case in Mrs. Inglethorp’s\\nbedroom had been forced. You stood by the mantelpiece, twiddling the\\nthings on it in your usual fashion, and your hand shook like a leaf! I\\nmust say——”\\n\\nBut I stopped suddenly. For Poirot, uttering a hoarse and inarticulate\\ncry, again annihilated his masterpiece of cards, and putting his hands\\nover his eyes swayed backwards and forwards, apparently suffering the\\nkeenest agony.\\n\\n“Good heavens, Poirot!” I cried. “What is the matter? Are you taken\\nill?”\\n\\n“No, no,” he gasped. “It is—it is—that I have an idea!”\\n\\n“Oh!” I exclaimed, much relieved. “One of your ‘little ideas’?”\\n\\n“Ah, _ma foi_, no!” replied Poirot frankly. “This time it is an idea\\ngigantic! Stupendous! And you—_you_, my friend, have given it to me!”\\n\\nSuddenly clasping me in his arms, he kissed me warmly on both cheeks,\\nand before I had recovered from my surprise ran headlong from the room.\\n\\nMary Cavendish entered at that moment.\\n\\n“What _is_ the matter with Monsieur Poirot? He rushed past me crying\\nout: ‘A garage! For the love of Heaven, direct me to a garage, madame!’\\nAnd, before I could answer, he had dashed out into the street.”\\n\\nI hurried to the window. True enough, there he was, tearing down the\\nstreet, hatless, and gesticulating as he went. I turned to Mary with a\\ngesture of despair.\\n\\n“He’ll be stopped by a policeman in another minute. There he goes,\\nround the corner!”\\n\\nOur eyes met, and we stared helplessly at one another.\\n\\n“What can be the matter?”\\n\\nI shook my head.\\n\\n“I don’t know. He was building card houses, when suddenly he said he\\nhad an idea, and rushed off as you saw.”\\n\\n“Well,” said Mary, “I expect he will be back before dinner.”\\n\\nBut night fell, and Poirot had not returned.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XII.\\nTHE LAST LINK\\n\\n\\nPoirot’s abrupt departure had intrigued us all greatly. Sunday morning\\nwore away, and still he did not reappear. But about three o’clock a\\nferocious and prolonged hooting outside drove us to the window, to see\\nPoirot alighting from a car, accompanied by Japp and Summerhaye. The\\nlittle man was transformed. He radiated an absurd complacency. He bowed\\nwith exaggerated respect to Mary Cavendish.\\n\\n“Madame, I have your permission to hold a little _réunion_ in the\\n_salon_? It is necessary for everyone to attend.”\\n\\nMary smiled sadly.\\n\\n“You know, Monsieur Poirot, that you have _carte blanche_ in every\\nway.”\\n\\n“You are too amiable, madame.”\\n\\nStill beaming, Poirot marshalled us all into the drawing-room, bringing\\nforward chairs as he did so.\\n\\n“Miss Howard—here. Mademoiselle Cynthia. Monsieur Lawrence. The good\\nDorcas. And Annie. _Bien!_ We must delay our proceedings a few minutes\\nuntil Mr. Inglethorp arrives. I have sent him a note.”\\n\\nMiss Howard rose immediately from her seat.\\n\\n“If that man comes into the house, I leave it!”\\n\\n“No, no!” Poirot went up to her and pleaded in a low voice.\\n\\nFinally Miss Howard consented to return to her chair. A few minutes\\nlater Alfred Inglethorp entered the room.\\n\\nThe company once assembled, Poirot rose from his seat with the air of a\\npopular lecturer, and bowed politely to his audience.\\n\\n“_Messieurs, mesdames_, as you all know, I was called in by Monsieur\\nJohn Cavendish to investigate this case. I at once examined the bedroom\\nof the deceased which, by the advice of the doctors, had been kept\\nlocked, and was consequently exactly as it had been when the tragedy\\noccurred. I found: first, a fragment of green material; second, a stain\\non the carpet near the window, still damp; thirdly, an empty box of\\nbromide powders.\\n\\n“To take the fragment of green material first, I found it caught in the\\nbolt of the communicating door between that room and the adjoining one\\noccupied by Mademoiselle Cynthia. I handed the fragment over to the\\npolice who did not consider it of much importance. Nor did they\\nrecognize it for what it was—a piece torn from a green land armlet.”\\n\\nThere was a little stir of excitement.\\n\\n“Now there was only one person at Styles who worked on the land—Mrs.\\nCavendish. Therefore it must have been Mrs. Cavendish who entered the\\ndeceased’s room through the door communicating with Mademoiselle\\nCynthia’s room.”\\n\\n“But that door was bolted on the inside!” I cried.\\n\\n“When I examined the room, yes. But in the first place we have only her\\nword for it, since it was she who tried that particular door and\\nreported it fastened. In the ensuing confusion she would have had ample\\nopportunity to shoot the bolt across. I took an early opportunity of\\nverifying my conjectures. To begin with, the fragment corresponds\\nexactly with a tear in Mrs. Cavendish’s armlet. Also, at the inquest,\\nMrs. Cavendish declared that she had heard, from her own room, the fall\\nof the table by the bed. I took an early opportunity of testing that\\nstatement by stationing my friend Monsieur Hastings in the left wing of\\nthe building, just outside Mrs. Cavendish’s door. I myself, in company\\nwith the police, went to the deceased’s room, and whilst there I,\\napparently accidentally, knocked over the table in question, but found\\nthat, as I had expected, Monsieur Hastings had heard no sound at all.\\nThis confirmed my belief that Mrs. Cavendish was not speaking the truth\\nwhen she declared that she had been dressing in her room at the time of\\nthe tragedy. In fact, I was convinced that, far from having been in her\\nown room, Mrs. Cavendish was actually in the deceased’s room when the\\nalarm was given.”\\n\\nI shot a quick glance at Mary. She was very pale, but smiling.\\n\\n“I proceeded to reason on that assumption. Mrs. Cavendish is in her\\nmother-in-law’s room. We will say that she is seeking for something and\\nhas not yet found it. Suddenly Mrs. Inglethorp awakens and is seized\\nwith an alarming paroxysm. She flings out her arm, overturning the bed\\ntable, and then pulls desperately at the bell. Mrs. Cavendish,\\nstartled, drops her candle, scattering the grease on the carpet. She\\npicks it up, and retreats quickly to Mademoiselle Cynthia’s room,\\nclosing the door behind her. She hurries out into the passage, for the\\nservants must not find her where she is. But it is too late! Already\\nfootsteps are echoing along the gallery which connects the two wings.\\nWhat can she do? Quick as thought, she hurries back to the young girl’s\\nroom, and starts shaking her awake. The hastily aroused household come\\ntrooping down the passage. They are all busily battering at Mrs.\\nInglethorp’s door. It occurs to nobody that Mrs. Cavendish has not\\narrived with the rest, but—and this is significant—I can find no one\\nwho saw her come from the other wing.” He looked at Mary Cavendish. “Am\\nI right, madame?”\\n\\nShe bowed her head.\\n\\n“Quite right, monsieur. You understand that, if I had thought I would\\ndo my husband any good by revealing these facts, I would have done so.\\nBut it did not seem to me to bear upon the question of his guilt or\\ninnocence.”\\n\\n“In a sense, that is correct, madame. But it cleared my mind of many\\nmisconceptions, and left me free to see other facts in their true\\nsignificance.”\\n\\n“The will!” cried Lawrence. “Then it was you, Mary, who destroyed the\\nwill?”\\n\\nShe shook her head, and Poirot shook his also.\\n\\n“No,” he said quietly. “There is only one person who could possibly\\nhave destroyed that will—Mrs. Inglethorp herself!”\\n\\n“Impossible!” I exclaimed. “She had only made it out that very\\nafternoon!”\\n\\n“Nevertheless, _mon ami_, it was Mrs. Inglethorp. Because, in no other\\nway can you account for the fact that, on one of the hottest days of\\nthe year, Mrs. Inglethorp ordered a fire to be lighted in her room.”\\n\\nI gave a gasp. What idiots we had been never to think of that fire as\\nbeing incongruous! Poirot was continuing:\\n\\n“The temperature on that day, messieurs, was 80 degrees in the shade.\\nYet Mrs. Inglethorp ordered a fire! Why? Because she wished to destroy\\nsomething, and could think of no other way. You will remember that, in\\nconsequence of the War economics practiced at Styles, no waste paper\\nwas thrown away. There was therefore no means of destroying a thick\\ndocument such as a will. The moment I heard of a fire being lighted in\\nMrs. Inglethorp’s room, I leaped to the conclusion that it was to\\ndestroy some important document—possibly a will. So the discovery of\\nthe charred fragment in the grate was no surprise to me. I did not, of\\ncourse, know at the time that the will in question had only been made\\nthis afternoon, and I will admit that, when I learnt that fact, I fell\\ninto a grievous error. I came to the conclusion that Mrs. Inglethorp’s\\ndetermination to destroy her will arose as a direct consequence of the\\nquarrel she had that afternoon, and that therefore the quarrel took\\nplace after, and not before the making of the will.\\n\\n“Here, as we know, I was wrong, and I was forced to abandon that idea.\\nI faced the problem from a new standpoint. Now, at four o’clock, Dorcas\\noverheard her mistress saying angrily: ‘You need not think that any\\nfear of publicity, or scandal between husband and wife will deter me.”\\nI conjectured, and conjectured rightly, that these words were\\naddressed, not to her husband, but to Mr. John Cavendish. At five\\no’clock, an hour later, she uses almost the same words, but the\\nstandpoint is different. She admits to Dorcas, ‘I don’t know what to\\ndo; scandal between husband and wife is a dreadful thing.’ At four\\no’clock she has been angry, but completely mistress of herself. At five\\no’clock she is in violent distress, and speaks of having had a great\\nshock.\\n\\n“Looking at the matter psychologically, I drew one deduction which I\\nwas convinced was correct. The second ‘scandal’ she spoke of was not\\nthe same as the first—and it concerned herself!\\n\\n“Let us reconstruct. At four o’clock, Mrs. Inglethorp quarrels with her\\nson, and threatens to denounce him to his wife—who, by the way,\\noverheard the greater part of the conversation. At four-thirty, Mrs.\\nInglethorp, in consequence of a conversation on the validity of wills,\\nmakes a will in favour of her husband, which the two gardeners witness.\\nAt five o’clock, Dorcas finds her mistress in a state of considerable\\nagitation, with a slip of paper—‘a letter,’ Dorcas thinks—in her hand,\\nand it is then that she orders the fire in her room to be lighted.\\nPresumably, then, between four-thirty and five o’clock, something has\\noccurred to occasion a complete revolution of feeling, since she is now\\nas anxious to destroy the will, as she was before to make it. What was\\nthat something?\\n\\n“As far as we know, she was quite alone during that half-hour. Nobody\\nentered or left that boudoir. What then occasioned this sudden change\\nof sentiment?\\n\\n“One can only guess, but I believe my guess to be correct. Mrs.\\nInglethorp had no stamps in her desk. We know this, because later she\\nasked Dorcas to bring her some. Now in the opposite corner of the room\\nstood her husband’s desk—locked. She was anxious to find some stamps,\\nand, according to my theory, she tried her own keys in the desk. That\\none of them fitted I know. She therefore opened the desk, and in\\nsearching for the stamps she came across something else—that slip of\\npaper which Dorcas saw in her hand, and which assuredly was never meant\\nfor Mrs. Inglethorp’s eyes. On the other hand, Mrs. Cavendish believed\\nthat the slip of paper to which her mother-in-law clung so tenaciously\\nwas a written proof of her own husband’s infidelity. She demanded it\\nfrom Mrs. Inglethorp who assured her, quite truly, that it had nothing\\nto do with that matter. Mrs. Cavendish did not believe her. She thought\\nthat Mrs. Inglethorp was shielding her stepson. Now Mrs. Cavendish is a\\nvery resolute woman, and, behind her mask of reserve, she was madly\\njealous of her husband. She determined to get hold of that paper at all\\ncosts, and in this resolution chance came to her aid. She happened to\\npick up the key of Mrs. Inglethorp’s despatch-case, which had been lost\\nthat morning. She knew that her mother-in-law invariably kept all\\nimportant papers in this particular case.\\n\\n“Mrs. Cavendish, therefore, made her plans as only a woman driven\\ndesperate through jealousy could have done. Some time in the evening\\nshe unbolted the door leading into Mademoiselle Cynthia’s room.\\nPossibly she applied oil to the hinges, for I found that it opened\\nquite noiselessly when I tried it. She put off her project until the\\nearly hours of the morning as being safer, since the servants were\\naccustomed to hearing her move about her room at that time. She dressed\\ncompletely in her land kit, and made her way quietly through\\nMademoiselle Cynthia’s room into that of Mrs. Inglethorp.”\\n\\nHe paused a moment, and Cynthia interrupted:\\n\\n“But I should have woken up if anyone had come through my room?”\\n\\n“Not if you were drugged, mademoiselle.”\\n\\n“Drugged?”\\n\\n“_Mais, oui!_”\\n\\n“You remember”—he addressed us collectively again—“that through all the\\ntumult and noise next door Mademoiselle Cynthia slept. That admitted of\\ntwo possibilities. Either her sleep was feigned—which I did not\\nbelieve—or her unconsciousness was induced by artificial means.\\n\\n“With this latter idea in my mind, I examined all the coffee-cups most\\ncarefully, remembering that it was Mrs. Cavendish who had brought\\nMademoiselle Cynthia her coffee the night before. I took a sample from\\neach cup, and had them analysed—with no result. I had counted the cups\\ncarefully, in the event of one having been removed. Six persons had\\ntaken coffee, and six cups were duly found. I had to confess myself\\nmistaken.\\n\\n“Then I discovered that I had been guilty of a very grave oversight.\\nCoffee had been brought in for seven persons, not six, for Dr.\\nBauerstein had been there that evening. This changed the face of the\\nwhole affair, for there was now one cup missing. The servants noticed\\nnothing, since Annie, the housemaid, who took in the coffee, brought in\\nseven cups, not knowing that Mr. Inglethorp never drank it, whereas\\nDorcas, who cleared them away the following morning, found six as\\nusual—or strictly speaking she found five, the sixth being the one\\nfound broken in Mrs. Inglethorp’s room.\\n\\n“I was confident that the missing cup was that of Mademoiselle Cynthia.\\nI had an additional reason for that belief in the fact that all the\\ncups found contained sugar, which Mademoiselle Cynthia never took in\\nher coffee. My attention was attracted by the story of Annie about some\\n‘salt’ on the tray of cocoa which she took every night to Mrs.\\nInglethorp’s room. I accordingly secured a sample of that cocoa, and\\nsent it to be analysed.”\\n\\n“But that had already been done by Dr. Bauerstein,” said Lawrence\\nquickly.\\n\\n“Not exactly. The analyst was asked by him to report whether strychnine\\nwas, or was not, present. He did not have it tested, as I did, for a\\nnarcotic.”\\n\\n“For a narcotic?”\\n\\n“Yes. Here is the analyst’s report. Mrs. Cavendish administered a safe,\\nbut effectual, narcotic to both Mrs. Inglethorp and Mademoiselle\\nCynthia. And it is possible that she had a _mauvais quart d’heure_ in\\nconsequence! Imagine her feelings when her mother-in-law is suddenly\\ntaken ill and dies, and immediately after she hears the word ‘Poison’!\\nShe has believed that the sleeping draught she administered was\\nperfectly harmless, but there is no doubt that for one terrible moment\\nshe must have feared that Mrs. Inglethorp’s death lay at her door. She\\nis seized with panic, and under its influence she hurries downstairs,\\nand quickly drops the coffee-cup and saucer used by Mademoiselle\\nCynthia into a large brass vase, where it is discovered later by\\nMonsieur Lawrence. The remains of the cocoa she dare not touch. Too\\nmany eyes are upon her. Guess at her relief when strychnine is\\nmentioned, and she discovers that after all the tragedy is not her\\ndoing.\\n\\n“We are now able to account for the symptoms of strychnine poisoning\\nbeing so long in making their appearance. A narcotic taken with\\nstrychnine will delay the action of the poison for some hours.”\\n\\nPoirot paused. Mary looked up at him, the colour slowly rising in her\\nface.\\n\\n“All you have said is quite true, Monsieur Poirot. It was the most\\nawful hour of my life. I shall never forget it. But you are wonderful.\\nI understand now——”\\n\\n“What I meant when I told you that you could safely confess to Papa\\nPoirot, eh? But you would not trust me.”\\n\\n“I see everything now,” said Lawrence. “The drugged cocoa, taken on top\\nof the poisoned coffee, amply accounts for the delay.”\\n\\n“Exactly. But was the coffee poisoned, or was it not? We come to a\\nlittle difficulty here, since Mrs. Inglethorp never drank it.”\\n\\n“What?” The cry of surprise was universal.\\n\\n“No. You will remember my speaking of a stain on the carpet in Mrs.\\nInglethorp’s room? There were some peculiar points about that stain. It\\nwas still damp, it exhaled a strong odour of coffee, and imbedded in\\nthe nap of the carpet I found some little splinters of china. What had\\nhappened was plain to me, for not two minutes before I had placed my\\nlittle case on the table near the window, and the table, tilting up,\\nhad deposited it upon the floor on precisely the identical spot. In\\nexactly the same way, Mrs. Inglethorp had laid down her cup of coffee\\non reaching her room the night before, and the treacherous table had\\nplayed her the same trick.\\n\\n“What happened next is mere guess work on my part, but I should say\\nthat Mrs. Inglethorp picked up the broken cup and placed it on the\\ntable by the bed. Feeling in need of a stimulant of some kind, she\\nheated up her cocoa, and drank it off then and there. Now we are faced\\nwith a new problem. We know the cocoa contained no strychnine. The\\ncoffee was never drunk. Yet the strychnine must have been administered\\nbetween seven and nine o’clock that evening. What third medium was\\nthere—a medium so suitable for disguising the taste of strychnine that\\nit is extraordinary no one has thought of it?” Poirot looked round the\\nroom, and then answered himself impressively. “Her medicine!”\\n\\n“Do you mean that the murderer introduced the strychnine into her\\ntonic?” I cried.\\n\\n“There was no need to introduce it. It was already there—in the\\nmixture. The strychnine that killed Mrs. Inglethorp was the identical\\nstrychnine prescribed by Dr. Wilkins. To make that clear to you, I will\\nread you an extract from a book on dispensing which I found in the\\nDispensary of the Red Cross Hospital at Tadminster:\\n\\n“‘The following prescription has become famous in text books:\\n\\n\\n          Strychninae Sulph. . . . . . 1 gr.\\n\\n          Potass Bromide . . . . . . . 3vi\\n\\n          Aqua ad. . . . . . . . . . . . . 3viii\\n\\n          Fiat Mistura\\n\\n\\n_This solution deposits in a few hours the greater part of the\\nstrychnine salt as an insoluble bromide in transparent crystals. A lady\\nin England lost her life by taking a similar mixture: the precipitated\\nstrychnine collected at the bottom, and in taking the last dose she\\nswallowed nearly all of it!_\\n\\n“Now there was, of course, no bromide in Dr. Wilkins’ prescription, but\\nyou will remember that I mentioned an empty box of bromide powders. One\\nor two of those powders introduced into the full bottle of medicine\\nwould effectually precipitate the strychnine, as the book describes,\\nand cause it to be taken in the last dose. You will learn later that\\nthe person who usually poured out Mrs. Inglethorp’s medicine was always\\nextremely careful not to shake the bottle, but to leave the sediment at\\nthe bottom of it undisturbed.\\n\\n“Throughout the case, there have been evidences that the tragedy was\\nintended to take place on Monday evening. On that day, Mrs.\\nInglethorp’s bell wire was neatly cut, and on Monday evening\\nMademoiselle Cynthia was spending the night with friends, so that Mrs.\\nInglethorp would have been quite alone in the right wing, completely\\nshut off from help of any kind, and would have died, in all\\nprobability, before medical aid could have been summoned. But in her\\nhurry to be in time for the village entertainment Mrs. Inglethorp\\nforgot to take her medicine, and the next day she lunched away from\\nhome, so that the last—and fatal—dose was actually taken twenty-four\\nhours later than had been anticipated by the murderer; and it is owing\\nto that delay that the final proof—the last link of the chain—is now in\\nmy hands.”\\n\\nAmid breathless excitement, he held out three thin strips of paper.\\n\\n“A letter in the murderer’s own hand-writing, _mes amis!_ Had it been a\\nlittle clearer in its terms, it is possible that Mrs. Inglethorp,\\nwarned in time, would have escaped. As it was, she realized her danger,\\nbut not the manner of it.”\\n\\nIn the deathly silence, Poirot pieced together the slips of paper and,\\nclearing his throat, read:\\n\\nDearest Evelyn:\\n\\n    ‘You will be anxious at hearing nothing. It is all right—only it\\n    will be to-night instead of last night. You understand. There’s a\\n    good time coming once the old woman is dead and out of the way. No\\n    one can possibly bring home the crime to me. That idea of yours\\n    about the bromides was a stroke of genius! But we must be very\\n    circumspect. A false step——’\\n\\n\\n“Here, my friends, the letter breaks off. Doubtless the writer was\\ninterrupted; but there can be no question as to his identity. We all\\nknow this hand-writing and——”\\n\\nA howl that was almost a scream broke the silence.\\n\\n“You devil! How did you get it?”\\n\\nA chair was overturned. Poirot skipped nimbly aside. A quick movement\\non his part, and his assailant fell with a crash.\\n\\n“_Messieurs, mesdames_,” said Poirot, with a flourish, “let me\\nintroduce you to the murderer, Mr. Alfred Inglethorp!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIII.\\nPOIROT EXPLAINS\\n\\n\\n“Poirot, you old villain,” I said, “I’ve half a mind to strangle you!\\nWhat do you mean by deceiving me as you have done?”\\n\\nWe were sitting in the library. Several hectic days lay behind us. In\\nthe room below, John and Mary were together once more, while Alfred\\nInglethorp and Miss Howard were in custody. Now at last, I had Poirot\\nto myself, and could relieve my still burning curiosity.\\n\\nPoirot did not answer me for a moment, but at last he said:\\n\\n“I did not deceive you, _mon ami_. At most, I permitted you to deceive\\nyourself.”\\n\\n“Yes, but why?”\\n\\n“Well, it is difficult to explain. You see, my friend, you have a\\nnature so honest, and a countenance so transparent, that—_enfin_, to\\nconceal your feelings is impossible! If I had told you my ideas, the\\nvery first time you saw Mr. Alfred Inglethorp that astute gentleman\\nwould have—in your so expressive idiom—‘smelt a rat’! And then,\\n_bonjour_ to our chances of catching him!”\\n\\n“I think that I have more diplomacy than you give me credit for.”\\n\\n“My friend,” besought Poirot, “I implore you, do not enrage yourself!\\nYour help has been of the most invaluable. It is but the extremely\\nbeautiful nature that you have, which made me pause.”\\n\\n“Well,” I grumbled, a little mollified. “I still think you might have\\ngiven me a hint.”\\n\\n“But I did, my friend. Several hints. You would not take them. Think\\nnow, did I ever say to you that I believed John Cavendish guilty? Did I\\nnot, on the contrary, tell you that he would almost certainly be\\nacquitted?”\\n\\n“Yes, but——”\\n\\n“And did I not immediately afterwards speak of the difficulty of\\nbringing the murderer to justice? Was it not plain to you that I was\\nspeaking of two entirely different persons?”\\n\\n“No,” I said, “it was not plain to me!”\\n\\n“Then again,” continued Poirot, “at the beginning, did I not repeat to\\nyou several times that I didn’t want Mr. Inglethorp arrested _now_?\\nThat should have conveyed something to you.”\\n\\n“Do you mean to say you suspected him as long ago as that?”\\n\\n“Yes. To begin with, whoever else might benefit by Mrs. Inglethorp’s\\ndeath, her husband would benefit the most. There was no getting away\\nfrom that. When I went up to Styles with you that first day, I had no\\nidea as to how the crime had been committed, but from what I knew of\\nMr. Inglethorp I fancied that it would be very hard to find anything to\\nconnect him with it. When I arrived at the château, I realized at once\\nthat it was Mrs. Inglethorp who had burnt the will; and there, by the\\nway, you cannot complain, my friend, for I tried my best to force on\\nyou the significance of that bedroom fire in midsummer.”\\n\\n“Yes, yes,” I said impatiently. “Go on.”\\n\\n“Well, my friend, as I say, my views as to Mr. Inglethorp’s guilt were\\nvery much shaken. There was, in fact, so much evidence against him that\\nI was inclined to believe that he had not done it.”\\n\\n“When did you change your mind?”\\n\\n“When I found that the more efforts I made to clear him, the more\\nefforts he made to get himself arrested. Then, when I discovered that\\nInglethorp had nothing to do with Mrs. Raikes and that in fact it was\\nJohn Cavendish who was interested in that quarter, I was quite sure.”\\n\\n“But why?”\\n\\n“Simply this. If it had been Inglethorp who was carrying on an intrigue\\nwith Mrs. Raikes, his silence was perfectly comprehensible. But, when I\\ndiscovered that it was known all over the village that it was John who\\nwas attracted by the farmer’s pretty wife, his silence bore quite a\\ndifferent interpretation. It was nonsense to pretend that he was afraid\\nof the scandal, as no possible scandal could attach to him. This\\nattitude of his gave me furiously to think, and I was slowly forced to\\nthe conclusion that Alfred Inglethorp wanted to be arrested. _Eh bien!_\\nfrom that moment, I was equally determined that he should not be\\narrested.”\\n\\n“Wait a minute. I don’t see why he wished to be arrested?”\\n\\n“Because, _mon ami_, it is the law of your country that a man once\\nacquitted can never be tried again for the same offence. Aha! but it\\nwas clever—his idea! Assuredly, he is a man of method. See here, he\\nknew that in his position he was bound to be suspected, so he conceived\\nthe exceedingly clever idea of preparing a lot of manufactured evidence\\nagainst himself. He wished to be arrested. He would then produce his\\nirreproachable alibi—and, hey presto, he was safe for life!”\\n\\n“But I still don’t see how he managed to prove his alibi, and yet go to\\nthe chemist’s shop?”\\n\\nPoirot stared at me in surprise.\\n\\n“Is it possible? My poor friend! You have not yet realized that it was\\nMiss Howard who went to the chemist’s shop?”\\n\\n“Miss Howard?”\\n\\n“But, certainly. Who else? It was most easy for her. She is of a good\\nheight, her voice is deep and manly; moreover, remember, she and\\nInglethorp are cousins, and there is a distinct resemblance between\\nthem, especially in their gait and bearing. It was simplicity itself.\\nThey are a clever pair!”\\n\\n“I am still a little fogged as to how exactly the bromide business was\\ndone,” I remarked.\\n\\n“_Bon!_ I will reconstruct for you as far as possible. I am inclined to\\nthink that Miss Howard was the master mind in that affair. You remember\\nher once mentioning that her father was a doctor? Possibly she\\ndispensed his medicines for him, or she may have taken the idea from\\none of the many books lying about when Mademoiselle Cynthia was\\nstudying for her exam. Anyway, she was familiar with the fact that the\\naddition of a bromide to a mixture containing strychnine would cause\\nthe precipitation of the latter. Probably the idea came to her quite\\nsuddenly. Mrs. Inglethorp had a box of bromide powders, which she\\noccasionally took at night. What could be easier than quietly to\\ndissolve one or more of those powders in Mrs. Inglethorp’s large sized\\nbottle of medicine when it came from Coot’s? The risk is practically\\nnil. The tragedy will not take place until nearly a fortnight later. If\\nanyone has seen either of them touching the medicine, they will have\\nforgotten it by that time. Miss Howard will have engineered her\\nquarrel, and departed from the house. The lapse of time, and her\\nabsence, will defeat all suspicion. Yes, it was a clever idea! If they\\nhad left it alone, it is possible the crime might never have been\\nbrought home to them. But they were not satisfied. They tried to be too\\nclever—and that was their undoing.”\\n\\nPoirot puffed at his tiny cigarette, his eyes fixed on the ceiling.\\n\\n“They arranged a plan to throw suspicion on John Cavendish, by buying\\nstrychnine at the village chemist’s, and signing the register in his\\nhand-writing.\\n\\n“On Monday Mrs. Inglethorp will take the last dose of her medicine. On\\nMonday, therefore, at six o’clock, Alfred Inglethorp arranges to be\\nseen by a number of people at a spot far removed from the village. Miss\\nHoward has previously made up a cock and bull story about him and Mrs.\\nRaikes to account for his holding his tongue afterwards. At six\\no’clock, Miss Howard, disguised as Alfred Inglethorp, enters the\\nchemist’s shop, with her story about a dog, obtains the strychnine, and\\nwrites the name of Alfred Inglethorp in John’s handwriting, which she\\nhad previously studied carefully.\\n\\n“But, as it will never do if John, too, can prove an alibi, she writes\\nhim an anonymous note—still copying his hand-writing—which takes him to\\na remote spot where it is exceedingly unlikely that anyone will see\\nhim.\\n\\n“So far, all goes well. Miss Howard goes back to Middlingham. Alfred\\nInglethorp returns to Styles. There is nothing that can compromise him\\nin any way, since it is Miss Howard who has the strychnine, which,\\nafter all, is only wanted as a blind to throw suspicion on John\\nCavendish.\\n\\n“But now a hitch occurs. Mrs. Inglethorp does not take her medicine\\nthat night. The broken bell, Cynthia’s absence—arranged by Inglethorp\\nthrough his wife—all these are wasted. And then—he makes his slip.\\n\\n“Mrs. Inglethorp is out, and he sits down to write to his accomplice,\\nwho, he fears, may be in a panic at the non-success of their plan. It\\nis probable that Mrs. Inglethorp returned earlier than he expected.\\nCaught in the act, and somewhat flurried he hastily shuts and locks his\\ndesk. He fears that if he remains in the room he may have to open it\\nagain, and that Mrs. Inglethorp might catch sight of the letter before\\nhe could snatch it up. So he goes out and walks in the woods, little\\ndreaming that Mrs. Inglethorp will open his desk, and discover the\\nincriminating document.\\n\\n“But this, as we know, is what happened. Mrs. Inglethorp reads it, and\\nbecomes aware of the perfidy of her husband and Evelyn Howard, though,\\nunfortunately, the sentence about the bromides conveys no warning to\\nher mind. She knows that she is in danger—but is ignorant of where the\\ndanger lies. She decides to say nothing to her husband, but sits down\\nand writes to her solicitor, asking him to come on the morrow, and she\\nalso determines to destroy immediately the will which she has just\\nmade. She keeps the fatal letter.”\\n\\n“It was to discover that letter, then, that her husband forced the lock\\nof the despatch-case?”\\n\\n“Yes, and from the enormous risk he ran we can see how fully he\\nrealized its importance. That letter excepted, there was absolutely\\nnothing to connect him with the crime.”\\n\\n“There’s only one thing I can’t make out, why didn’t he destroy it at\\nonce when he got hold of it?”\\n\\n“Because he did not dare take the biggest risk of all—that of keeping\\nit on his own person.”\\n\\n“I don’t understand.”\\n\\n“Look at it from his point of view. I have discovered that there were\\nonly five short minutes in which he could have taken it—the five\\nminutes immediately before our own arrival on the scene, for before\\nthat time Annie was brushing the stairs, and would have seen anyone who\\npassed going to the right wing. Figure to yourself the scene! He enters\\nthe room, unlocking the door by means of one of the other doorkeys—they\\nwere all much alike. He hurries to the despatch-case—it is locked, and\\nthe keys are nowhere to be seen. That is a terrible blow to him, for it\\nmeans that his presence in the room cannot be concealed as he had\\nhoped. But he sees clearly that everything must be risked for the sake\\nof that damning piece of evidence. Quickly, he forces the lock with a\\npenknife, and turns over the papers until he finds what he is looking\\nfor.\\n\\n“But now a fresh dilemma arises: he dare not keep that piece of paper\\non him. He may be seen leaving the room—he may be searched. If the\\npaper is found on him, it is certain doom. Probably, at this minute,\\ntoo, he hears the sounds below of Mr. Wells and John leaving the\\nboudoir. He must act quickly. Where can he hide this terrible slip of\\npaper? The contents of the waste-paper-basket are kept and in any case,\\nare sure to be examined. There are no means of destroying it; and he\\ndare not keep it. He looks round, and he sees—what do you think, _mon\\nami?_”\\n\\nI shook my head.\\n\\n“In a moment, he has torn the letter into long thin strips, and rolling\\nthem up into spills he thrusts them hurriedly in amongst the other\\nspills in the vase on the mantle-piece.”\\n\\nI uttered an exclamation.\\n\\n“No one would think of looking there,” Poirot continued. “And he will\\nbe able, at his leisure, to come back and destroy this solitary piece\\nof evidence against him.”\\n\\n“Then, all the time, it was in the spill vase in Mrs. Inglethorp’s\\nbedroom, under our very noses?” I cried.\\n\\nPoirot nodded.\\n\\n“Yes, my friend. That is where I discovered my ‘last link,’ and I owe\\nthat very fortunate discovery to you.”\\n\\n“To me?”\\n\\n“Yes. Do you remember telling me that my hand shook as I was\\nstraightening the ornaments on the mantelpiece?”\\n\\n“Yes, but I don’t see——”\\n\\n“No, but I saw. Do you know, my friend, I remembered that earlier in\\nthe morning, when we had been there together, I had straightened all\\nthe objects on the mantelpiece. And, if they were already straightened,\\nthere would be no need to straighten them again, unless, in the\\nmeantime, someone else had touched them.”\\n\\n“Dear me,” I murmured, “so that is the explanation of your\\nextraordinary behaviour. You rushed down to Styles, and found it still\\nthere?”\\n\\n“Yes, and it was a race for time.”\\n\\n“But I still can’t understand why Inglethorp was such a fool as to\\nleave it there when he had plenty of opportunity to destroy it.”\\n\\n“Ah, but he had no opportunity. _I_ saw to that.”\\n\\n“You?”\\n\\n“Yes. Do you remember reproving me for taking the household into my\\nconfidence on the subject?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“Well, my friend, I saw there was just one chance. I was not sure then\\nif Inglethorp was the criminal or not, but if he was I reasoned that he\\nwould not have the paper on him, but would have hidden it somewhere,\\nand by enlisting the sympathy of the household I could effectually\\nprevent his destroying it. He was already under suspicion, and by\\nmaking the matter public I secured the services of about ten amateur\\ndetectives, who would be watching him unceasingly, and being himself\\naware of their watchfulness he would not dare seek further to destroy\\nthe document. He was therefore forced to depart from the house, leaving\\nit in the spill vase.”\\n\\n“But surely Miss Howard had ample opportunities of aiding him.”\\n\\n“Yes, but Miss Howard did not know of the paper’s existence. In\\naccordance with their prearranged plan, she never spoke to Alfred\\nInglethorp. They were supposed to be deadly enemies, and until John\\nCavendish was safely convicted they neither of them dared risk a\\nmeeting. Of course I had a watch kept on Mr. Inglethorp, hoping that\\nsooner or later he would lead me to the hiding-place. But he was too\\nclever to take any chances. The paper was safe where it was; since no\\none had thought of looking there in the first week, it was not likely\\nthey would do so afterwards. But for your lucky remark, we might never\\nhave been able to bring him to justice.”\\n\\n“I understand that now; but when did you first begin to suspect Miss\\nHoward?”\\n\\n“When I discovered that she had told a lie at the inquest about the\\nletter she had received from Mrs. Inglethorp.”\\n\\n“Why, what was there to lie about?”\\n\\n“You saw that letter? Do you recall its general appearance?”\\n\\n“Yes—more or less.”\\n\\n“You will recollect, then, that Mrs. Inglethorp wrote a very\\ndistinctive hand, and left large clear spaces between her words. But if\\nyou look at the date at the top of the letter you will notice that\\n‘July 17th’ is quite different in this respect. Do you see what I\\nmean?”\\n\\n“No,” I confessed, “I don’t.”\\n\\n“You do not see that that letter was not written on the 17th, but on\\nthe 7th—the day after Miss Howard’s departure? The ‘1’ was written in\\nbefore the ‘7’ to turn it into the ‘17th’.”\\n\\n“But why?”\\n\\n“That is exactly what I asked myself. Why does Miss Howard suppress the\\nletter written on the 17th, and produce this faked one instead? Because\\nshe did not wish to show the letter of the 17th. Why, again? And at\\nonce a suspicion dawned in my mind. You will remember my saying that it\\nwas wise to beware of people who were not telling you the truth.”\\n\\n“And yet,” I cried indignantly, “after that, you gave me two reasons\\nwhy Miss Howard could not have committed the crime!”\\n\\n“And very good reasons too,” replied Poirot. “For a long time they were\\na stumbling-block to me until I remembered a very significant fact:\\nthat she and Alfred Inglethorp were cousins. She could not have\\ncommitted the crime single-handed, but the reasons against that did not\\ndebar her from being an accomplice. And, then, there was that rather\\nover-vehement hatred of hers! It concealed a very opposite emotion.\\nThere was, undoubtedly, a tie of passion between them long before he\\ncame to Styles. They had already arranged their infamous plot—that he\\nshould marry this rich, but rather foolish old lady, induce her to make\\na will leaving her money to him, and then gain their ends by a very\\ncleverly conceived crime. If all had gone as they planned, they would\\nprobably have left England, and lived together on their poor victim’s\\nmoney.\\n\\n“They are a very astute and unscrupulous pair. While suspicion was to\\nbe directed against him, she would be making quiet preparations for a\\nvery different _dénouement_. She arrives from Middlingham with all the\\ncompromising items in her possession. No suspicion attaches to her. No\\nnotice is paid to her coming and going in the house. She hides the\\nstrychnine and glasses in John’s room. She puts the beard in the attic.\\nShe will see to it that sooner or later they are duly discovered.”\\n\\n“I don’t quite see why they tried to fix the blame on John,” I\\nremarked. “It would have been much easier for them to bring the crime\\nhome to Lawrence.”\\n\\n“Yes, but that was mere chance. All the evidence against him arose out\\nof pure accident. It must, in fact, have been distinctly annoying to\\nthe pair of schemers.”\\n\\n“His manner was unfortunate,” I observed thoughtfully.\\n\\n“Yes. You realize, of course, what was at the back of that?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“You did not understand that he believed Mademoiselle Cynthia guilty of\\nthe crime?”\\n\\n“No,” I exclaimed, astonished. “Impossible!”\\n\\n“Not at all. I myself nearly had the same idea. It was in my mind when\\nI asked Mr. Wells that first question about the will. Then there were\\nthe bromide powders which she had made up, and her clever male\\nimpersonations, as Dorcas recounted them to us. There was really more\\nevidence against her than anyone else.”\\n\\n“You are joking, Poirot!”\\n\\n“No. Shall I tell you what made Monsieur Lawrence turn so pale when he\\nfirst entered his mother’s room on the fatal night? It was because,\\nwhilst his mother lay there, obviously poisoned, he saw, over your\\nshoulder, that the door into Mademoiselle Cynthia’s room was unbolted.”\\n\\n“But he declared that he saw it bolted!” I cried.\\n\\n“Exactly,” said Poirot dryly. “And that was just what confirmed my\\nsuspicion that it was not. He was shielding Mademoiselle Cynthia.”\\n\\n“But why should he shield her?”\\n\\n“Because he is in love with her.”\\n\\nI laughed.\\n\\n“There, Poirot, you are quite wrong! I happen to know for a fact that,\\nfar from being in love with her, he positively dislikes her.”\\n\\n“Who told you that, _mon ami?_”\\n\\n“Cynthia herself.”\\n\\n“_La pauvre petite!_ And she was concerned?”\\n\\n“She said that she did not mind at all.”\\n\\n“Then she certainly did mind very much,” remarked Poirot. “They are\\nlike that—_les femmes!_”\\n\\n“What you say about Lawrence is a great surprise to me,” I said.\\n\\n“But why? It was most obvious. Did not Monsieur Lawrence make the sour\\nface every time Mademoiselle Cynthia spoke and laughed with his\\nbrother? He had taken it into his long head that Mademoiselle Cynthia\\nwas in love with Monsieur John. When he entered his mother’s room, and\\nsaw her obviously poisoned, he jumped to the conclusion that\\nMademoiselle Cynthia knew something about the matter. He was nearly\\ndriven desperate. First he crushed the coffee-cup to powder under his\\nfeet, remembering that _she_ had gone up with his mother the night\\nbefore, and he determined that there should be no chance of testing its\\ncontents. Thenceforward, he strenuously, and quite uselessly, upheld\\nthe theory of ‘Death from natural causes’.”\\n\\n“And what about the ‘extra coffee-cup’?”\\n\\n“I was fairly certain that it was Mrs. Cavendish who had hidden it, but\\nI had to make sure. Monsieur Lawrence did not know at all what I meant;\\nbut, on reflection, he came to the conclusion that if he could find an\\nextra coffee-cup anywhere his lady love would be cleared of suspicion.\\nAnd he was perfectly right.”\\n\\n“One thing more. What did Mrs. Inglethorp mean by her dying words?”\\n\\n“They were, of course, an accusation against her husband.”\\n\\n“Dear me, Poirot,” I said with a sigh, “I think you have explained\\neverything. I am glad it has all ended so happily. Even John and his\\nwife are reconciled.”\\n\\n“Thanks to me.”\\n\\n“How do you mean—thanks to you?”\\n\\n“My dear friend, do you not realize that it was simply and solely the\\ntrial which has brought them together again? That John Cavendish still\\nloved his wife, I was convinced. Also, that she was equally in love\\nwith him. But they had drifted very far apart. It all arose from a\\nmisunderstanding. She married him without love. He knew it. He is a\\nsensitive man in his way, he would not force himself upon her if she\\ndid not want him. And, as he withdrew, her love awoke. But they are\\nboth unusually proud, and their pride held them inexorably apart. He\\ndrifted into an entanglement with Mrs. Raikes, and she deliberately\\ncultivated the friendship of Dr. Bauerstein. Do you remember the day of\\nJohn Cavendish’s arrest, when you found me deliberating over a big\\ndecision?”\\n\\n“Yes, I quite understood your distress.”\\n\\n“Pardon me, _mon ami_, but you did not understand it in the least. I\\nwas trying to decide whether or not I would clear John Cavendish at\\nonce. I could have cleared him—though it might have meant a failure to\\nconvict the real criminals. They were entirely in the dark as to my\\nreal attitude up to the very last moment—which partly accounts for my\\nsuccess.”\\n\\n“Do you mean that you could have saved John Cavendish from being\\nbrought to trial?”\\n\\n“Yes, my friend. But I eventually decided in favour of ‘a woman’s\\nhappiness’. Nothing but the great danger through which they have passed\\ncould have brought these two proud souls together again.”\\n\\nI looked at Poirot in silent amazement. The colossal cheek of the\\nlittle man! Who on earth but Poirot would have thought of a trial for\\nmurder as a restorer of conjugal happiness!\\n\\n“I perceive your thoughts, _mon ami_,” said Poirot, smiling at me. “No\\none but Hercule Poirot would have attempted such a thing! And you are\\nwrong in condemning it. The happiness of one man and one woman is the\\ngreatest thing in all the world.”\\n\\nHis words took me back to earlier events. I remembered Mary as she lay\\nwhite and exhausted on the sofa, listening, listening. There had come\\nthe sound of the bell below. She had started up. Poirot had opened the\\ndoor, and meeting her agonized eyes had nodded gently. “Yes, madame,”\\nhe said. “I have brought him back to you.” He had stood aside, and as I\\nwent out I had seen the look in Mary’s eyes, as John Cavendish had\\ncaught his wife in his arms.\\n\\n“Perhaps you are right, Poirot,” I said gently. “Yes, it is the\\ngreatest thing in the world.”\\n\\nSuddenly, there was a tap at the door, and Cynthia peeped in.\\n\\n“I—I only——”\\n\\n“Come in,” I said, springing up.\\n\\nShe came in, but did not sit down.\\n\\n“I—only wanted to tell you something——”\\n\\n“Yes?”\\n\\nCynthia fidgeted with a little tassel for some moments, then, suddenly\\nexclaiming: “You dears!” kissed first me and then Poirot, and rushed\\nout of the room again.\\n\\n“What on earth does this mean?” I asked, surprised.\\n\\nIt was very nice to be kissed by Cynthia, but the publicity of the\\nsalute rather impaired the pleasure.\\n\\n“It means that she has discovered Monsieur Lawrence does not dislike\\nher as much as she thought,” replied Poirot philosophically.\\n\\n“But——”\\n\\n“Here he is.”\\n\\nLawrence at that moment passed the door.\\n\\n“Eh! Monsieur Lawrence,” called Poirot. “We must congratulate you, is\\nit not so?”\\n\\nLawrence blushed, and then smiled awkwardly. A man in love is a sorry\\nspectacle. Now Cynthia had looked charming.\\n\\nI sighed.\\n\\n“What is it, _mon ami?_”\\n\\n“Nothing,” I said sadly. “They are two delightful women!”\\n\\n“And neither of them is for you?” finished Poirot. “Never mind. Console\\nyourself, my friend. We may hunt together again, who knows? And then——”\\n\\n\\nTHE END\\n\\n  POIROT INVESTIGATES\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  BY THE SAME AUTHOR\\n\\n  THE MYSTERIOUS AFFAIR AT STYLES\\n\\n  THE SECRET ADVERSARY\\n\\n  THE MURDER ON THE LINKS\\n\\n  THE BODLEY HEAD\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  POIROT INVESTIGATES\\n\\n  BY AGATHA CHRISTIE\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  LONDON\\n\\n  JOHN LANE THE BODLEY HEAD LIMITED\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  First published in Great Britain by\\n  John Lane Company, The Bodley Head Limited, 1924\\n\\n  Copyright © 1924 Agatha Christie Limited\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  CONTENTS\\n\\n\\n  I The Adventure of “The Western Star”\\n\\n  II The Tragedy at Marsdon Manor\\n\\n  III The Adventure of the Cheap Flat\\n\\n  IV The Mystery of Hunter’s Lodge\\n\\n  V The Million Dollar Bond Robbery\\n\\n  VI The Adventure of the Egyptian Tomb\\n\\n  VII Jewel Robbery at the _Grand Metropolitan_\\n\\n  VIII The Kidnapped Prime Minister\\n\\n  IX The Disappearance of Mr. Davenheim\\n\\n  X The Adventure of the Italian Nobleman\\n\\n  XI The Case of the Missing Will\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  POIROT INVESTIGATES\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  POIROT INVESTIGATES\\n\\n\\n  I\\n\\n\\n  The Adventure of “The Western Star”\\n\\nI was standing at the window of Poirot’s rooms looking out idly on\\nthe street below.\\n\\n“That’s queer,” I ejaculated suddenly beneath my breath.\\n\\n“What is, _mon ami_?” asked Poirot placidly, from the depths of\\nhis comfortable chair.\\n\\n“Deduce, Poirot, from the following facts! Here is a young lady,\\nrichly dressed—fashionable hat, magnificent furs. She is coming\\nalong slowly, looking up at the houses as she goes. Unknown to her,\\nshe is being shadowed by three men and a middle-aged woman. They\\nhave just been joined by an errand boy who points after the girl,\\ngesticulating as he does so. What drama is this being played? Is\\nthe girl a crook, and are the shadowers detectives preparing to\\narrest her? Or are _they_ the scoundrels, and are they plotting to\\nattack an innocent victim? What does the great detective say?”\\n\\n“The great detective, _mon ami_, chooses, as ever, the simplest\\ncourse. He rises to see for himself.” And my friend joined me at\\nthe window.\\n\\nIn a minute he gave vent to an amused chuckle.\\n\\n“As usual, your facts are tinged with your incurable romanticism.\\nThat is Miss Mary Marvell, the film star. She is being followed by\\na bevy of admirers who have recognized her. And, _en passant_, my\\ndear Hastings, she is quite aware of the fact!”\\n\\nI laughed.\\n\\n“So all is explained! But you get no marks for that, Poirot. It\\nwas a mere matter of recognition.”\\n\\n“_En vérité!_ And how many times have you seen Mary Marvell on the\\nscreen, _mon cher_?”\\n\\nI thought.\\n\\n“About a dozen times perhaps.”\\n\\n“And I—once! Yet _I_ recognize her, and _you_ do not.”\\n\\n“She looks so different,” I replied rather feebly.\\n\\n“Ah! _Sacré_!” cried Poirot. “Is it that you expect her to promenade\\nherself in the streets of London in a cowboy hat, or with bare\\nfeet, and a bunch of curls, as an Irish colleen? Always with you\\nit is the non-essentials! Remember the case of the dancer, Valerie\\nSaintclair.”\\n\\nI shrugged my shoulders, slightly annoyed.\\n\\n“But console yourself, _mon ami_,” said Poirot, calming down. “All\\ncannot be as Hercule Poirot! I know it well.”\\n\\n“You really have the best opinion of yourself of anyone I ever\\nknew!” I cried, divided between amusement and annoyance.\\n\\n“What will you? When one is unique, one knows it! And others share\\nthat opinion—even, if I mistake not, Miss Mary Marvell.”\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“Without doubt. She is coming here.”\\n\\n“How do you make that out?”\\n\\n“Very simply. This street, it is not aristocratic, _mon ami_! In\\nit there is no fashionable doctor, no fashionable dentist—still\\nless is there a fashionable milliner! But there _is_ a fashionable\\ndetective. _Oui_, my friend, it is true—I am become the mode, the\\n_dernier cri_! One says to another: ‘_Comment?_ You have lost your\\ngold pencil-case? You must go to the little Belgian. He is too\\nmarvellous! Every one goes! _Courez!’_ And they arrive! In flocks,\\n_mon ami_! With problems of the most foolish!” A bell rang below.\\n“What did I tell you? That is Miss Marvell.”\\n\\nAs usual, Poirot was right. After a short interval, the American\\nfilm star was ushered in, and we rose to our feet.\\n\\nMary Marvell was undoubtedly one of the most popular actresses on\\nthe screen. She had only lately arrived in England in company with\\nher husband, Gregory B. Rolf, also a film actor. Their marriage\\nhad taken place about a year ago in the States and this was their\\nfirst visit to England. They had been given a great reception.\\nEvery one was prepared to go mad over Mary Marvell, her wonderful\\nclothes, her furs, her jewels, above all one jewel, the great\\ndiamond which had been nicknamed, to match its owner, “the Western\\nStar.” Much, true and untrue, had been written about this famous\\nstone which was reported to be insured for the enormous sum of\\nfifty thousand pounds.\\n\\nAll these details passed rapidly through my mind as I joined with\\nPoirot in greeting our fair client.\\n\\nMiss Marvell was small and slender, very fair and girlish-looking,\\nwith the wide innocent blue eyes of a child.\\n\\nPoirot drew forward a chair for her, and she commenced talking at\\nonce.\\n\\n“You will probably think me very foolish, Monsieur Poirot, but Lord\\nCronshaw was telling me last night how wonderfully you cleared up\\nthe mystery of his nephew’s death, and I felt that I just must have\\nyour advice. I dare say it’s only a silly hoax—Gregory says so—but\\nit’s just worrying me to death.”\\n\\nShe paused for breath. Poirot beamed encouragement.\\n\\n“Proceed, Madame. You comprehend, I am still in the dark.”\\n\\n“It’s these letters.” Miss Marvell unclasped her handbag, and drew\\nout three envelopes which she handed to Poirot.\\n\\nThe latter scrutinized them closely.\\n\\n“Cheap paper—the name and address carefully printed. Let us see\\nthe inside.” He drew out the enclosure.\\n\\nI had joined him, and was leaning over his shoulder. The writing\\nconsisted of a single sentence, carefully printed like the envelope.\\nIt ran as follows:\\n\\n“The great diamond which is the left eye of the god must return\\nwhence it came.”\\n\\nThe second letter was couched in precisely the same terms, but the\\nthird was more explicit:\\n\\n“You have been warned. You have not obeyed. Now the diamond will\\nbe taken from you. At the full of the moon, the two diamonds which\\nare the left and right eye of the god shall return. So it is\\nwritten.”\\n\\n“The first letter I treated as a joke,” explained Miss Marvell.\\n“When I got the second, I began to wonder. The third one came\\nyesterday, and it seemed to me that, after all, the matter might\\nbe more serious than I had imagined.”\\n\\n“I see they did not come by post, these letters.”\\n\\n“No; they were left by hand—by a _Chinaman._ That is what frightens\\nme.”\\n\\n“Why?”\\n\\n“Because it was from a Chink in San Francisco that Gregory bought\\nthe stone three years ago.”\\n\\n“I see, madame, that you believe the diamond referred to to be——”\\n\\n“‘The Western Star,’” finished Miss Marvell. “That’s so. At the\\ntime, Gregory remembers that there was some story attached to the\\nstone, but the Chink wasn’t handing out any information. Gregory\\nsays he seemed just scared to death, and in a mortal hurry to get\\nrid of the thing. He only asked about a tenth of its value. It was\\nGreg’s wedding present to me.”\\n\\nPoirot nodded thoughtfully.\\n\\n“The story seems of an almost unbelievable romanticism. And yet—who\\nknows? I pray of you, Hastings, hand me my little almanac.”\\n\\nI complied.\\n\\n“_Voyons!_” said Poirot, turning the leaves.\\n\\n“When is the date of the full moon? Ah, Friday next. That is in\\nthree days’ time. _Eh bien_, madame, you seek my advice—I give it\\nto you. This _belle histoire_ may be a hoax—but it may not!\\nTherefore I counsel you to place the diamond in my keeping until\\nafter Friday next. Then we can take what steps we please.”\\n\\nA slight cloud passed over the actress’s face, and she replied\\nconstrainedly:\\n\\n“I’m afraid that’s impossible.”\\n\\n“You have it with you—_hein_?” Poirot was watching her narrowly.\\n\\nThe girl hesitated a moment, then slipped her hand into the bosom\\nof her gown, drawing out a long thin chain. She leaned forward,\\nunclosing her hand. In the palm, a stone of white fire, exquisitely\\nset in platinum, lay and winked at us solemnly.\\n\\nPoirot drew in his breath with a long hiss.\\n\\n“_Épatant!_” he murmured. “You permit, madame?” He took the jewel\\nin his own hand and scrutinized it keenly, then restored it to her\\nwith a little bow. “A magnificent stone—without a flaw. Ah, _cent\\ntonnerres!_ and you carry it about with you, _comme ça_!”\\n\\n“No, no, I’m very careful really, Monsieur Poirot. As a rule it’s\\nlocked up in my jewel-case, and left in the hotel safe deposit.\\nWe’re staying at the _Magnificent_, you know. I just brought it\\nalong to-day for you to see.”\\n\\n“And you will leave it with me, _n’est-ce pas_? You will be advised\\nby Papa Poirot?”\\n\\n“Well, you see, it’s this way, Monsieur Poirot. On Friday we’re\\ngoing down to Yardly Chase to spend a few days with Lord and Lady\\nYardly.”\\n\\nHer words awoke a vague echo of remembrance in my mind. Some\\ngossip—what was it now? A few years ago Lord and Lady Yardly had\\npaid a visit to the States, rumour had it that his lordship had\\nrather gone the pace out there with the assistance of some lady\\nfriends—but surely there was something more, some gossip which\\ncoupled Lady Yardly’s name with that of a “movie” star in\\nCalifornia—why! it came to me in a flash—of course it was none\\nother than Gregory B. Rolf.\\n\\n“I’ll let you into a little secret, Monsieur Poirot,” Miss Marvell\\nwas continuing. “We’ve got a deal on with Lord Yardly. There’s some\\nchance of our arranging to film a play down there in his ancestral\\npile.”\\n\\n“At Yardly Chase?” I cried, interested. “Why, it’s one of the show\\nplaces of England.”\\n\\nMiss Marvell nodded.\\n\\n“I guess it’s the real old feudal stuff all right. But he wants a\\npretty stiff price, and of course I don’t know yet whether the deal\\nwill go through, but Greg and I always like to combine business\\nwith pleasure.”\\n\\n“But—I demand pardon if I am dense, madame—surely it is possible\\nto visit Yardly Chase without taking the diamond with you?”\\n\\nA shrewd, hard look came into Miss Marvell’s eyes which belied\\ntheir childlike appearance. She looked suddenly a good deal older.\\n\\n“I want to wear it down there.”\\n\\n“Surely” I said suddenly, “there are some very famous jewels in\\nthe Yardly collection, a large diamond amongst them?”\\n\\n“That’s so,” said Miss Marvell briefly.\\n\\nI heard Poirot murmur beneath his breath: “Ah, _c’est comme ça_!”\\nThen he said aloud, with his usual uncanny luck in hitting the\\nbull’s-eye (he dignifies it by the name of psychology): “Then you\\nare without doubt already acquainted with Lady Yardly, or perhaps\\nyour husband is?”\\n\\n“Gregory knew her when she was out West three years ago,” said Miss\\nMarvell. She hesitated a moment, and then added abruptly: “Do\\neither of you ever see _Society Gossip_?”\\n\\nWe both pleaded guilty rather shamefacedly.\\n\\n“I ask because in this week’s number there is an article on famous\\njewels, and it’s really very curious——” She broke off.\\n\\nI rose, went to the table at the other side of the room and returned\\nwith the paper in question in my hand. She took it from me, found\\nthe article, and began to read aloud:\\n\\n“. . . Amongst other famous stones may be included the Star of the\\nEast, a diamond in the possession of the Yardly family. An ancestor\\nof the present Lord Yardly brought it back with him from China,\\nand a romantic story is said to attach to it. According to this,\\nthe stone was once the right eye of a temple god. Another diamond,\\nexactly similar in form and size, formed the left eye, and the\\nstory goes that this jewel, too, would in course of time be stolen.\\n‘One eye shall go West, the other East, till they shall meet once\\nmore. Then, in triumph shall they return to the god.’ It is a\\ncurious coincidence that there is at the present time a stone\\ncorresponding closely in description with this one, and known as\\n‘the Star of the West,’ or ‘the Western Star.’ It is the property\\nof the celebrated film actress, Miss Mary Marvell. A comparison of\\nthe two stones would be interesting.”\\n\\nShe stopped.\\n\\n“_Épatant!_” murmured Poirot. “Without doubt a romance of the first\\nwater.” He turned to Mary Marvell. “And you are not afraid, madame?\\nYou have no superstitious terrors? You do not fear to introduce\\nthese two Siamese twins to each other lest a Chinaman should appear\\nand, hey presto! whisk them both back to China?”\\n\\nHis tone was mocking, but I fancied that an undercurrent of\\nseriousness lay beneath it.\\n\\n“I don’t believe that Lady Yardly’s diamond is anything like as\\ngood a stone as mine,” said Miss Marvell. “Anyway, I’m going to\\nsee.”\\n\\nWhat more Poirot would have said I do not know, for at that moment\\nthe door flew open, and a splendid-looking man strode into the\\nroom. From his crisply curling black head, to the tips of his\\npatent-leather boots, he was a hero fit for romance.\\n\\n“I said I’d call round for you, Mary,” said Gregory Rolf, “and here\\nI am. Well, what does Monsieur Poirot say to our little problem?\\nJust one big hoax, same as I do?”\\n\\nPoirot smiled up at the big actor. They made a ridiculous contrast.\\n\\n“Hoax or no hoax, Mr. Rolf,” he said dryly, “I have advised Madame\\nyour wife not to take the jewel with her to Yardly Chase on Friday.”\\n\\n“I’m with you there, sir. I’ve already said so to Mary. But there!\\nShe’s a woman through and through, and I guess she can’t bear to\\nthink of another woman outshining her in the jewel line.”\\n\\n“What nonsense, Gregory!” said Mary Marvell sharply. But she\\nflushed angrily.\\n\\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n“Madame, I have advised. I can do no more. _C’est fini_.”\\n\\nHe bowed them both to the door.\\n\\n“Ah! _la la_,” he observed, returning. “_Histoire de femmes!_ The\\ngood husband, he hit the nail on the head—_tout de même_, he was\\nnot tactful! Assuredly not.”\\n\\nI imparted to him my vague remembrances, and he nodded vigorously.\\n\\n“So I thought. All the same, there is something curious underneath\\nall this. With your permission, _mon ami_, I will take the air.\\nAwait my return, I beg of you. I shall not be long.”\\n\\nI was half asleep in my chair when the landlady tapped on the door,\\nand put her head in.\\n\\n“It’s another lady to see Mr. Poirot, sir. I’ve told her he was\\nout, but she says as how she’ll wait, seeing as she’s come up from\\nthe country.”\\n\\n“Oh, show her in here, Mrs. Murchison. Perhaps I can do something\\nfor her.”\\n\\nIn another moment the lady had been ushered in. My heart gave a\\nleap as I recognized her. Lady Yardly’s portrait had figured too\\noften in the Society papers to allow her to remain unknown.\\n\\n“Do sit down, Lady Yardly,” I said, drawing forward a chair. “My\\nfriend Poirot is out, but I know for a fact that he’ll be back very\\nshortly.”\\n\\nShe thanked me and sat down. A very different type, this, from Miss\\nMary Marvell. Tall, dark, with flashing eyes, and a pale proud\\nface—yet something wistful in the curves of the mouth.\\n\\nI felt a desire to rise to the occasion. Why not? In Poirot’s\\npresence I have frequently felt a difficulty—I do not appear at my\\nbest. And yet there is no doubt that I, too, possess the deductive\\nsense in a marked degree. I leant forward on a sudden impulse.\\n\\n“Lady Yardly,” I said, “I know why you have come here. You have\\nreceived blackmailing letters about the diamond.”\\n\\nThere was no doubt as to my bolt having shot home. She stared at\\nme open-mouthed, all colour banished from her cheeks.\\n\\n“You know?” she gasped. “How?”\\n\\nI smiled.\\n\\n“By a perfectly logical process. If Miss Marvell has had warning\\nletters——”\\n\\n“Miss Marvell? She has been here?”\\n\\n“She has just left. As I was saying, if she, as the holder of one\\nof the twin diamonds, has received a mysterious series of warnings,\\nyou, as the holder of the other stone, must necessarily have done\\nthe same. You see how simple it is? I am right, then, you have\\nreceived these strange communications also?”\\n\\nFor a moment she hesitated, as though in doubt whether to trust me\\nor not, then she bowed her head in assent with a little smile.\\n\\n“That is so,” she acknowledged.\\n\\n“Were yours, too, left by hand—by a Chinaman?”\\n\\n“No, they came by post; but, tell me, has Miss Marvell undergone\\nthe same experience, then?”\\n\\nI recounted to her the events of the morning. She listened\\nattentively.\\n\\n“It all fits in. My letters are the duplicates of hers. It is true\\nthat they came by post, but there is a curious perfume impregnating\\nthem—something in the nature of joss-stick—that at once suggested\\nthe East to me. What does it all mean?”\\n\\nI shook my head.\\n\\n“That is what we must find out. You have the letters with you? We\\nmight learn something from the postmarks.”\\n\\n“Unfortunately I destroyed them. You understand, at the time I\\nregarded it as some foolish joke. Can it be true that some Chinese\\ngang are really trying to recover the diamonds? It seems too\\nincredible.”\\n\\nWe went over the facts again and again, but could get no further\\ntowards the elucidation of the mystery. At last Lady Yardly rose.\\n\\n“I really don’t think I need wait for Monsieur Poirot. You can tell\\nhim all this, can’t you? Thank you so much, Mr.——”\\n\\nShe hesitated, her hand outstretched.\\n\\n“Captain Hastings.”\\n\\n“Of course! How stupid of me. You’re a friend of the Cavendishes,\\naren’t you? It was Mary Cavendish who sent me to Monsieur Poirot.”\\n\\nWhen my friend returned, I enjoyed telling him the tale of what\\nhad occurred during his absence. He cross-questioned me rather\\nsharply over the details of our conversation and I could read\\nbetween the lines that he was not best pleased to have been absent.\\nI also fancied that the dear old fellow was just the least inclined\\nto be jealous. It had become rather a pose with him to consistently\\nbelittle my abilities, and I think he was chagrined at finding no\\nloophole for criticism. I was secretly rather pleased with myself,\\nthough I tried to conceal the fact for fear of irritating him. In\\nspite of his idiosyncrasies, I was deeply attached to my quaint\\nlittle friend.\\n\\n“_Bien!_” he said at length, with a curious look on his face. “The\\nplot develops. Pass me, I pray you, that ‘Peerage’ on the top shelf\\nthere.” He turned the leaves. “Ah, here we are! ‘Yardly . . . 10th\\nviscount, served South African War’ . . . _tout ça n’a pas\\nd’importance_ . . . ‘mar. 1907 Hon. Maude Stopperton, fourth\\ndaughter of 3rd Baron Cotteril’ . . . um, um, um, . . . ‘has iss.\\ntwo daughters, born 1908, 1910. . . . Clubs . . . residences.’ . . .\\n_Voilà_, that does not tell us much. But to-morrow morning we see\\nthis _milord_!”\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“Yes. I telegraphed to him.”\\n\\n“I thought you had washed your hands of the case?”\\n\\n“I am not acting for Miss Marvell since she refuses to be guided\\nby my advice. What I do now is for my own satisfaction—the\\nsatisfaction of Hercule Poirot! Decidedly, I must have a finger in\\nthis pie.”\\n\\n“And you calmly wire Lord Yardly to dash up to town just to suit\\nyour convenience. He won’t be pleased.”\\n\\n“_Au contraire_, if I preserve for him his family diamond, he ought\\nto be very grateful.”\\n\\n“Then you really think there is a chance of it being stolen?” I\\nasked eagerly.\\n\\n“Almost a certainty,” replied Poirot placidly. “Everything points\\nthat way.”\\n\\n“But how——”\\n\\nPoirot stopped my eager questions with an airy gesture of the hand.\\n\\n“Not now, I pray you. Let us not confuse the mind. And observe that\\n‘Peerage’—how you have replaced him! See you not that the tallest\\nbooks go in the top shelf, the next tallest in the row beneath,\\nand so on. Thus we have order, _method_, which, as I have often\\ntold you, Hastings——”\\n\\n“Exactly,” I said hastily, and put the offending volume in its\\nproper place.\\n\\n\\n  •   •   •   •   •   •   •\\n\\n\\nLord Yardly turned out to be a cheery, loud-voiced sportsman with\\na rather red face, but with a good-humoured bonhomie about him that\\nwas distinctly attractive and made up for any lack of mentality.\\n\\n“Extraordinary business this, Monsieur Poirot. Can’t make head or\\ntail of it. Seems my wife’s been getting odd kind of letters, and\\nthat this Miss Marvell’s had ’em too. What does it all mean?”\\n\\nPoirot handed him the copy of _Society Gossip_.\\n\\n“First, _milord_, I would ask you if these facts are substantially\\ncorrect?”\\n\\nThe peer took it. His face darkened with anger as he read.\\n\\n“Damned nonsense!” he spluttered. “There’s never been any romantic\\nstory attaching to the diamond. It came from India originally, I\\nbelieve. I never heard of all this Chinese god stuff.”\\n\\n“Still, the stone _is_ known as ‘The Star of the East.’”\\n\\n“Well, what if it is?” he demanded wrathfully.\\n\\nPoirot smiled a little, but made no direct reply. “What I would\\nask you to do, _milord_, is to place yourself in my hands. If you\\ndo so unreservedly, I have great hopes of averting the catastrophe.”\\n\\n“Then you think there’s actually something in these wild-cat\\ntales?”\\n\\n“Will you do as I ask you?”\\n\\n“Of course I will, but——”\\n\\n“_Bien!_ Then permit that I ask you a few questions. This affair\\nof Yardly Chase, is it, as you say, all fixed up between you and\\nMr. Rolf?”\\n\\n“Oh, he told you about it, did he? No, there’s nothing settled.”\\nHe hesitated, the brick-red colour of his face deepening. “Might\\nas well get the thing straight. I’ve made rather an ass of myself\\nin many ways, Monsieur Poirot—and I’m head over ears in debt—but\\nI want to pull up. I’m fond of the kids, and I want to straighten\\nthings up, and be able to live on at the old place. Gregory Rolf\\nis offering me big money—enough to set me on my feet again. I don’t\\nwant to do it—I hate the thought of all that crowd play-acting\\nround the Chase—but I may have to, unless——” He broke off.\\n\\nPoirot eyed him keenly. “You have, then, another string to your\\nbow? Permit that I make a guess? It is to sell the Star of the\\nEast?”\\n\\nLord Yardly nodded. “That’s it. It’s been in the family for some\\ngenerations, but it’s not entailed. Still, it’s not the easiest\\nthing in the world to find a purchaser. Hoffberg, the Hatton Garden\\nman, is on the look-out for a likely customer, but he’ll have to\\nfind one soon, or it’s a washout.”\\n\\n“One more question, _permettez_—Lady Yardly, which plan does she\\napprove?”\\n\\n“Oh, she’s bitterly opposed to my selling the jewel. You know what\\nwomen are. She’s all for this film stunt.”\\n\\n“I comprehend,” said Poirot. He remained a moment or so in thought,\\nthen rose briskly to his feet. “You return to Yardly Chase at once?\\n_Bien!_ Say no word to anyone—to _anyone_ mind—but expect us there\\nthis evening. We will arrive shortly after five.”\\n\\n“All right, but I don’t see——”\\n\\n“_Ça n’a pas d’importance_,” said Poirot kindly. “You will that I\\npreserve for you your diamond, _n’est-ce pas_?”\\n\\n“Yes, but——”\\n\\n“Then do as I say.”\\n\\nA sadly bewildered nobleman left the room.\\n\\n  •   •   •   •   •   •   •\\n\\nIt was half-past five when we arrived at Yardly Chase, and followed\\nthe dignified butler to the old panelled hall with its fire of\\nblazing logs. A pretty picture met our eyes: Lady Yardly and her\\ntwo children, the mother’s proud dark head bent down over the two\\nfair ones. Lord Yardly stood near, smiling down on them.\\n\\n“Monsieur Poirot and Captain Hastings,” announced the butler.\\n\\nLady Yardly looked up with a start, her husband came forward\\nuncertainly, his eyes seeking instruction from Poirot. The little\\nman was equal to the occasion.\\n\\n“All my excuses! It is that I investigate still this affair of Miss\\nMarvell’s. She comes to you on Friday, does she not? I make a\\nlittle tour first to make sure that all is secure. Also I wanted\\nto ask of Lady Yardly if she recollected at all the postmarks on\\nthe letters she received?”\\n\\nLady Yardly shook her head regretfully. “I’m afraid I don’t. It is\\nstupid of me. But, you see, I never dreamt of taking them\\nseriously.”\\n\\n“You’ll stay the night?” said Lord Yardly.\\n\\n“Oh, _milord_, I fear to incommode you. We have left our bags at\\nthe inn.”\\n\\n“That’s all right.” Lord Yardly had his cue. “We’ll send down for\\nthem. No, no—no trouble, I assure you.”\\n\\nPoirot permitted himself to be persuaded, and sitting down by Lady\\nYardly, began to make friends with the children. In a short time\\nthey were all romping together, and had dragged me into the game.\\n\\n“_Vous êtes bonne mère_,” said Poirot, with a gallant little bow,\\nas the children were removed reluctantly by a stern nurse.\\n\\nLady Yardly smoothed her ruffled hair.\\n\\n“I adore them,” she said with a little catch in her voice.\\n\\n“And they you—with reason!” Poirot bowed again.\\n\\nA dressing-gong sounded, and we rose to go up to our rooms. At that\\nmoment the butler entered with a telegram on a salver which he\\nhanded to Lord Yardly. The latter tore it open with a brief word\\nof apology. As he read it he stiffened visibly.\\n\\nWith an ejaculation, he handed it to his wife. Then he glanced at\\nmy friend.\\n\\n“Just a minute, Monsieur Poirot. I feel you ought to know about\\nthis. It’s from Hoffberg. He thinks he’s found a customer for the\\ndiamond—an American, sailing for the States to-morrow. They’re\\nsending down a chap to-night to vet the stone. By Jove, though, if\\nthis goes through——” Words failed him.\\n\\nLady Yardly had turned away. She still held the telegram in her\\nhand.\\n\\n“I wish you wouldn’t sell it, George,” she said, in a low voice.\\n“It’s been in the family so long.” She waited, as though for a\\nreply, but when none came her face hardened. She shrugged her\\nshoulders. “I must go and dress. I suppose I had better display\\n‘the goods.’” She turned to Poirot with a slight grimace. “It’s\\none of the most hideous necklaces that was ever designed! George\\nhas always promised to have the stones reset for me, but it’s never\\nbeen done.” She left the room.\\n\\nHalf an hour later, we three were assembled in the great drawing-room\\nawaiting the lady. It was already a few minutes past the dinner\\nhour.\\n\\nSuddenly there was a low rustle, and Lady Yardly appeared framed\\nin the doorway, a radiant figure in a long white shimmering dress.\\nRound the column of her neck was a rivulet of fire. She stood there\\nwith one hand just touching the necklace.\\n\\n“Behold the sacrifice,” she said gaily. Her ill-humour seemed to\\nhave vanished. “Wait while I turn the big light on and you shall\\nfeast your eyes on the ugliest necklace in England.”\\n\\nThe switches were just outside the door. As she stretched out her\\nhand to them, the incredible thing happened. Suddenly without any\\nwarning, every light was extinguished, the door banged, and from\\nthe other side of it came a long-drawn piercing woman’s scream.\\n\\n“My God!” cried Lord Yardly. “That was Maude’s voice! What has\\nhappened?”\\n\\nWe rushed blindly for the door, cannoning into each other in the\\ndarkness. It was some minutes before we could find it. What a sight\\nmet our eyes! Lady Yardly lay senseless on the marble floor, a\\ncrimson mark on her white throat where the necklace had been\\nwrenched from her neck.\\n\\nAs we bent over her, uncertain for the moment whether she were dead\\nor alive, her eyelids opened.\\n\\n“The Chinaman,” she whispered painfully. “The Chinaman—the side\\ndoor.”\\n\\nLord Yardly sprang up with an oath. I accompanied him, my heart\\nbeating wildly. The Chinaman again! The side door in question was\\na small one in the angle of the wall, not more than a dozen yards\\nfrom the scene of the tragedy. As we reached it, I gave a cry.\\nThere, just short of the threshold, lay the glittering necklace,\\nevidently dropped by the thief in the panic of his flight. I\\nswooped joyously down on it. Then I uttered another cry which Lord\\nYardly echoed. For in the middle of the necklace was a great gap.\\nThe Star of the East was missing!\\n\\n“That settles it,” I breathed. “These were no ordinary thieves.\\nThis one stone was all they wanted.”\\n\\n“But how did the fellow get in?”\\n\\n“Through this door.”\\n\\n“But it’s always locked.”\\n\\nI shook my head. “It’s not locked now. See.” I pulled it open as\\nI spoke.\\n\\nAs I did so something fluttered to the ground. I picked it up. It\\nwas a piece of silk, and the embroidery was unmistakable. It had\\nbeen torn from a Chinaman’s robe.\\n\\n“In his haste it caught in the door,” I explained. “Come, hurry.\\nHe cannot have gone far as yet.”\\n\\nBut in vain we hunted and searched. In the pitch darkness of the\\nnight, the thief had found it easy to make his getaway. We returned\\nreluctantly, and Lord Yardly sent off one of the footmen post-haste\\nto fetch the police.\\n\\nLady Yardly, aptly ministered to by Poirot, who is as good as a\\nwoman in these matters, was sufficiently recovered to be able to\\ntell her story.\\n\\n“I was just going to turn on the other light,” she said, “when a\\nman sprang on me from behind. He tore my necklace from my neck with\\nsuch force that I fell headlong to the floor. As I fell I saw him\\ndisappearing through the side door. Then I realized by the pig-tail\\nand the embroidered robe that he was a Chinaman.” She stopped with\\na shudder.\\n\\nThe butler reappeared. He spoke in a low voice to Lord Yardly.\\n\\n“A gentleman from Mr. Hoffberg’s, m’lord. He says you expect him.”\\n\\n“Good heavens!” cried the distracted nobleman. “I must see him, I\\nsuppose. No, not here, Mullings, in the library.”\\n\\nI drew Poirot aside.\\n\\n“Look here, my dear fellow, hadn’t we better get back to London?”\\n\\n“You think so, Hastings? Why?”\\n\\n“Well”—I coughed delicately—“things haven’t gone very well, have\\nthey? I mean, you tell Lord Yardly to place himself in your hands\\nand all will be well—and then the diamond vanishes from under your\\nvery nose!”\\n\\n“True,” said Poirot, rather crestfallen. “It was not one of my most\\nstriking triumphs.”\\n\\nThis way of describing events almost caused me to smile, but I\\nstuck to my guns.\\n\\n“So, having—pardon the expression—rather made a mess of things,\\ndon’t you think it would be more graceful to leave immediately?”\\n\\n“And the dinner, the without doubt excellent dinner, that the\\n_chef_ of Lord Yardly has prepared?”\\n\\n“Oh, what’s dinner!” I said impatiently.\\n\\nPoirot held up his hands in horror.\\n\\n“_Mon Dieu!_ It is that in this country you treat the affairs\\ngastronomic with a criminal indifference.”\\n\\n“There’s another reason why we should get back to London as soon\\nas possible,” I continued.\\n\\n“What is that, my friend?”\\n\\n“The other diamond,” I said, lowering my voice. “Miss Marvell’s.”\\n\\n“_Eh bien_, what of it?”\\n\\n“Don’t you see?” His unusual obtuseness annoyed me. What had\\nhappened to his usually keen wits? “They’ve got one, now they’ll\\ngo for the other.”\\n\\n“_Tiens!_” cried Poirot, stepping back a pace and regarding me with\\nadmiration. “But your brain marches to a marvel, my friend! Figure\\nto yourself that for the moment I had not thought of that! But\\nthere is plenty of time. The full of the moon, it is not until\\nFriday.”\\n\\nI shook my head dubiously. The full of the moon theory left me\\nentirely cold. I had my way with Poirot, however, and we departed\\nimmediately, leaving behind us a note of explanation and apology\\nfor Lord Yardly.\\n\\nMy idea was to go at once to the _Magnificent_, and relate to Miss\\nMarvell what had occurred, but Poirot vetoed the plan, and insisted\\nthat the morning would be time enough. I gave in rather grudgingly.\\n\\nIn the morning Poirot seemed strangely disinclined to stir out. I\\nbegan to suspect that, having made a mistake to start with, he was\\nsingularly loath to proceed with the case. In answer to my\\npersuasions, he pointed out, with admirable common sense, that as\\nthe details of the affair at Yardly Chase were already in the\\nmorning papers the Rolfs would know quite as much as we could tell\\nthem. I gave way unwillingly.\\n\\nEvents proved my forebodings to be justified. About two o’clock,\\nthe telephone rang. Poirot answered it. He listened for some\\nmoments, then with a brief “_Bien, j’y serai_” he rang off, and\\nturned to me.\\n\\n“What do you think, _mon ami_?” He looked half ashamed, half\\nexcited. “The diamond of Miss Marvell, it has been stolen.”\\n\\n“What?” I cried, springing up. “And what about the ‘full of the\\nmoon’ now?” Poirot hung his head. “When did this happen?”\\n\\n“This morning, I understand.”\\n\\nI shook my head sadly. “If only you had listened to me. You see I\\nwas right.”\\n\\n“It appears so, _mon ami_,” said Poirot cautiously. “Appearances\\nare deceptive, they say, but it certainly appears so.”\\n\\nAs we hurried in a taxi to the _Magnificent_, I puzzled out the\\ntrue inwardness of the scheme.\\n\\n“That ‘full of the moon’ idea was clever. The whole point of it\\nwas to get us to concentrate on the Friday, and so be off our guard\\nbeforehand. It is a pity you did not realize that.”\\n\\n“_Ma foi!_” said Poirot airily, his nonchalance quite restored\\nafter its brief eclipse. “One cannot think of everything!”\\n\\nI felt sorry for him. He did so hate failure of any kind.\\n\\n“Cheer up,” I said consolingly. “Better luck next time.”\\n\\nAt the _Magnificent_, we were ushered at once into the manager’s\\noffice. Gregory Rolf was there with two men from Scotland Yard. A\\npale-faced clerk sat opposite them.\\n\\nRolf nodded to us as we entered.\\n\\n“We’re getting to the bottom of it,” he said. “But it’s almost\\nunbelievable. How the guy had the nerve I can’t think.”\\n\\nA very few minutes sufficed to give us the facts. Mr. Rolf had gone\\nout of the hotel at 11.15. At 11.30, a gentleman, so like him in\\nappearance as to pass muster, entered the hotel and demanded the\\njewel-case from the safe deposit. He duly signed the receipt,\\nremarking carelessly as he did so: “Looks a bit different from my\\nordinary one, but I hurt my hand getting out of the taxi.” The\\nclerk merely smiled and remarked that he saw very little difference.\\nRolf laughed and said: “Well, don’t run me in as a crook this time,\\nanyway. I’ve been getting threatening letters from a Chinaman, and\\nthe worst of it is I look rather like a Chink myself—it’s something\\nabout the eyes.”\\n\\n“I looked at him,” said the clerk who was telling us this, “and I\\nsaw at once what he meant. The eyes slanted up at the corners like\\nan Oriental’s. I’d never noticed it before.”\\n\\n“Darn it all, man,” roared Gregory Rolf, leaning forward, “do you\\nnotice it now?”\\n\\nThe man looked up at him and started.\\n\\n“No, sir,” he said. “I can’t say I do.” And indeed there was\\nnothing even remotely Oriental about the frank brown eyes that\\nlooked into ours.\\n\\nThe Scotland Yard man grunted. “Bold customer. Thought the eyes\\nmight be noticed, and took the bull by the horns to disarm\\nsuspicion. He must have watched you out of the hotel, sir, and\\nnipped in as soon as you were well away.”\\n\\n“What about the jewel-case?” I asked.\\n\\n“It was found in a corridor of the hotel. Only one thing had been\\ntaken—‘the Western Star.’”\\n\\nWe stared at each other—the whole thing was so bizarre, so unreal.\\n\\nPoirot hopped briskly to his feet. “I have not been of much use,\\nI fear,” he said regretfully. “Is it permitted to see Madame?”\\n\\n“I guess she’s prostrated with the shock,” explained Rolf.\\n\\n“Then perhaps I might have a few words alone with you, monsieur?”\\n\\n“Certainly.”\\n\\nIn about five minutes Poirot reappeared.\\n\\n“Now, my friend,” he said gaily. “To a post office. I have to send\\na telegram.”\\n\\n“Who to?”\\n\\n“Lord Yardly.” He discounted further inquiries by slipping his arm\\nthrough mine. “Come, come, _mon ami_. I know all that you feel\\nabout this miserable business. I have not distinguished myself!\\nYou, in my place, might have distinguished yourself! _Bien!_ All\\nis admitted. Let us forget it and have lunch.”\\n\\nIt was about four o’clock when we entered Poirot’s rooms. A figure\\nrose from a chair by the window. It was Lord Yardly. He looked\\nhaggard and distraught.\\n\\n“I got your wire and came up at once. Look here, I’ve been round\\nto Hoffberg, and they know nothing about that man of theirs last\\nnight, or the wire either. Do you think that——”\\n\\nPoirot held up his hand.\\n\\n“My excuses! I sent that wire, and hired the gentleman in question.”\\n\\n“_You_—but why? What?” The nobleman spluttered impotently.\\n\\n“My little idea was to bring things to a head,” explained Poirot\\nplacidly.\\n\\n“Bring things to a head! Oh, my God!” cried Lord Yardly.\\n\\n“And the ruse succeeded,” said Poirot cheerfully. “Therefore,\\n_milord_, I have much pleasure in returning you—this!” With a\\ndramatic gesture he produced a glittering object. It was a great\\ndiamond.\\n\\n“The Star of the East,” gasped Lord Yardly. “But I don’t\\nunderstand——”\\n\\n“No?” said Poirot. “It makes no matter. Believe me, it was necessary\\nfor the diamond to be stolen. I promised you that it should be\\npreserved to you, and I have kept my word. You must permit me to\\nkeep my little secret. Convey, I beg of you, the assurances of my\\ndeepest respect to Lady Yardly, and tell her how pleased I am to\\nbe able to restore her jewel to her. What _beau temps_, is it not?\\nGood day, _milord_.”\\n\\nAnd smiling and talking, the amazing little man conducted the\\nbewildered nobleman to the door. He returned gently rubbing his\\nhands.\\n\\n“Poirot,” I said. “Am I quite demented?”\\n\\n“No, _mon ami_, but you are, as always, in a mental fog.”\\n\\n“How did you get the diamond.”\\n\\n“From Mr. Rolf.”\\n\\n“Rolf?”\\n\\n“_Mais oui!_ The warning letters, the Chinaman, the article in\\n_Society Gossip_, all sprang from the ingenious brain of Mr. Rolf!\\nThe two diamonds, supposed to be so miraculously alike—bah! they\\ndid not exist. There was only _one_ diamond, my friend! Originally\\nin the Yardly collection, for three years it has been in the\\npossession of Mr. Rolf. He stole it this morning with the assistance\\nof a touch of grease paint at the corner of each eye! Ah, I must\\nsee him on the film, he is indeed an artist, _celui-là_!\\n\\n“But why should he steal his own diamond?” I asked, puzzled.\\n\\n“For many reasons. To begin with, Lady Yardly was getting restive.”\\n\\n“Lady Yardly?”\\n\\n“You comprehend she was left much alone in California. Her husband\\nwas amusing himself elsewhere. Mr. Rolf was handsome, he had an\\nair about him of romance. But _au fond_, he is very business-like,\\n_ce monsieur_! He made love to Lady Yardly, and then he blackmailed\\nher. I taxed the lady with the truth the other night, and she\\nadmitted it. She swore that she had only been indiscreet, and I\\nbelieve her. But, undoubtedly, Rolf had letters of hers that could\\nbe twisted to bear a different interpretation. Terrified by the\\nthreat of a divorce, and the prospect of being separated from her\\nchildren, she agreed to all he wished. She had no money of her own,\\nand she was forced to permit him to substitute a paste replica for\\nthe real stone. The coincidence of the date of the appearance of\\n‘the Western Star’ struck me at once. All goes well. Lord Yardly\\nprepares to range himself—to settle down. And then comes the menace\\nof the possible sale of the diamond. The substitution will be\\ndiscovered. Without doubt she writes off frantically to Gregory\\nRolf who has just arrived in England. He soothes her by promising\\nto arrange all—and prepares for a double robbery. In this way he\\nwill quiet the lady, who might conceivably tell all to her husband,\\nan affair which would not suit our blackmailer at all, he will have\\n£50,000 insurance money (aha, you had forgotten that!), and he will\\nstill have the diamond! At this point I put my finger in the pie.\\nThe arrival of a diamond expert is announced. Lady Yardly, as I\\nfelt sure she would, immediately arranges a robbery—and does it\\nvery well too! But Hercule Poirot, he sees nothing but facts. What\\nhappens in actuality? The lady switches off the light, bangs the\\ndoor, throws the necklace down the passage, and screams. She has\\nalready wrenched out the diamond with pliers upstairs——”\\n\\n“But we saw the necklace round her neck!” I objected.\\n\\n“I demand pardon, my friend. Her hand concealed the part of it\\nwhere the gap would have shown. To place a piece of silk in the\\ndoor beforehand is child’s play! Of course, as soon as Rolf read\\nof the robbery, he arranged his own little comedy. And very well\\nhe played it!”\\n\\n“What did you say to him?” I asked with lively curiosity.\\n\\n“I said to him that Lady Yardly had told her husband all, that I\\nwas empowered to recover the jewel, and that if it were not\\nimmediately handed over proceedings would be taken. Also a few more\\nlittle lies which occurred to me. He was as wax in my hands!”\\n\\nI pondered the matter.\\n\\n“It seems a little unfair on Mary Marvell. She has lost her diamond\\nthrough no fault of her own.”\\n\\n“Bah!” said Poirot brutally. “She has a magnificent advertisement.\\nThat is all she cares for, that one! Now the other, she is\\ndifferent. _Bonne mère, très femme!_”\\n\\n“Yes,” I said doubtfully, hardly sharing Poirot’s views on\\nfemininity. “I suppose it was Rolf who sent her the duplicate\\nletters.”\\n\\n“_Pas du tout_,” said Poirot briskly. “She came by the advice of\\nMary Cavendish to seek my aid in her dilemma. Then she heard that\\nMary Marvell, whom she knew to be her enemy, had been here, and\\nshe changed her mind, jumping at a pretext that _you_, my friend,\\noffered her. A very few questions sufficed to show me that _you_\\ntold her of the letters, not she you! She jumped at the chance your\\nwords offered.”\\n\\n“I don’t believe it,” I cried, stung.\\n\\n“_Si, si, mon ami_, it is a pity that you study not the psychology.\\nShe told you that the letters were destroyed? Oh, la la, _never_\\ndoes a woman destroy a letter if she can avoid it! Not even if it\\nwould be more prudent to do so!”\\n\\n“It’s all very well,” I said, my anger rising, “but you’ve made a\\nperfect fool of me! From beginning to end! No, it’s all very well\\nto try and explain it away afterwards. There really is a limit!”\\n\\n“But you were so enjoying yourself, my friend. I had not the heart\\nto shatter your illusions.”\\n\\n“It’s no good. You’ve gone a bit too far this time.”\\n\\n“_Mon Dieu!_ but how you enrage yourself for nothing, _mon ami_!”\\n\\n“I’m fed up!” I went out, banging the door. Poirot had made an\\nabsolute laughing-stock of me. I decided that he needed a sharp\\nlesson. I would let some time elapse before I forgave him. He had\\nencouraged me to make a perfect fool of myself!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  II\\n\\n\\n  The Tragedy at Marsdon Manor\\n\\n\\nI had been called away from town for a few days, and on my return\\nfound Poirot in the act of strapping up his small valise.\\n\\n“_A la bonne heure_, Hastings. I feared you would not have returned\\nin time to accompany me.”\\n\\n“You are called away on a case, then?”\\n\\n“Yes, though I am bound to admit that, on the face of it, the\\naffair does not seem promising. The Northern Union Insurance\\nCompany have asked me to investigate the death of a Mr. Maltravers\\nwho a few weeks ago insured his life with them for the large sum\\nof fifty thousand pounds.”\\n\\n“Yes?” I said, much interested.\\n\\n“There was, of course, the usual suicide clause in the policy. In\\nthe event of his committing suicide within a year the premiums\\nwould be forfeited. Mr. Maltravers was duly examined by the\\nCompany’s own doctor, and although he was a man slightly past the\\nprime of life was passed as being in quite sound health. However,\\non Wednesday last—the day before yesterday—the body of Mr.\\nMaltravers was found in the grounds of his house in Essex, Marsdon\\nManor, and the cause of his death is described as some kind of\\ninternal hæmorrhage. That in itself would be nothing remarkable,\\nbut sinister rumours as to Mr. Maltravers’ financial position have\\nbeen in the air of late, and the Northern Union have ascertained\\nbeyond any possible doubt that the deceased gentleman stood upon\\nthe verge of bankruptcy. Now that alters matters considerably.\\nMaltravers had a beautiful young wife, and it is suggested that he\\ngot together all the ready money he could for the purpose of paying\\nthe premiums on a life insurance for his wife’s benefit, and then\\ncommitted suicide. Such a thing is not uncommon. In any case, my\\nfriend Alfred Wright, who is a director of the Northern Union, has\\nasked me to investigate the facts of the case, but, as I told him,\\nI am not very hopeful of success. If the cause of the death had\\nbeen heart failure, I should have been more sanguine. Heart failure\\nmay always be translated as the inability of the local G.P. to\\ndiscover what his patient really did die of, but a hæmorrhage seems\\nfairly definite. Still, we can but make some necessary inquiries.\\nFive minutes to pack your bag, Hastings, and we will take a taxi\\nto Liverpool Street.”\\n\\nAbout an hour later, we alighted from a Great Eastern train at the\\nlittle station of Marsdon Leigh. Inquiries at the station yielded\\nthe information that Marsdon Manor was about a mile distant. Poirot\\ndecided to walk, and we betook ourselves along the main street.\\n\\n“What is our plan of campaign?” I asked.\\n\\n“First I will call upon the doctor. I have ascertained that there\\nis only one doctor in Marsdon Leigh, Dr. Ralph Bernard. Ah, here\\nwe are at his house.”\\n\\nThe house in question was a kind of superior cottage, standing back\\na little from the road. A brass plate on the gate bore the doctor’s\\nname. We passed up the path and rang the bell.\\n\\nWe proved to be fortunate in our call. It was the doctor’s\\nconsulting hour, and for the moment there were no patients waiting\\nfor him. Dr. Bernard was an elderly man, high-shouldered and\\nstooping, with a pleasant vagueness of manner.\\n\\nPoirot introduced himself and explained the purpose of our visit,\\nadding that Insurance Companies were bound to investigate fully in\\na case of this kind.\\n\\n“Of course, of course,” said Dr. Bernard vaguely. “I suppose, as\\nhe was such a rich man, his life was insured for a big sum?”\\n\\n“You consider him a rich man, doctor?”\\n\\nThe doctor looked rather surprised.\\n\\n“Was he not? He kept two cars, you know, and Marsdon Manor is a\\npretty big place to keep up, although I believe he bought it very\\ncheap.”\\n\\n“I understand that he had had considerable losses of late,” said\\nPoirot, watching the doctor narrowly.\\n\\nThe latter, however, merely shook his head sadly.\\n\\n“Is that so? Indeed. It is fortunate for his wife, then, that there\\nis this life insurance. A very beautiful and charming young\\ncreature, but terribly unstrung by this sad catastrophe. A mass of\\nnerves, poor thing. I have tried to spare her all I can, but of\\ncourse the shock was bound to be considerable.”\\n\\n“You had been attending Mr. Maltravers recently?”\\n\\n“My dear sir, I never attended him.”\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“I understand Mr. Maltravers was a Christian Scientist—or something\\nof that kind.”\\n\\n“But you examined the body?”\\n\\n“Certainly. I was fetched by one of the under-gardeners.”\\n\\n“And the cause of death was clear?”\\n\\n“Absolutely. There was blood on the lips, but most of the bleeding\\nmust have been internal.”\\n\\n“Was he still lying where he had been found?”\\n\\n“Yes, the body had not been touched. He was lying at the edge of\\na small plantation. He had evidently been out shooting rooks, a\\nsmall rook rifle lay beside him. The hæmorrhage must have occurred\\nquite suddenly. Gastric ulcer, without a doubt.”\\n\\n“No question of his having been shot, eh?”\\n\\n“My dear sir!”\\n\\n“I demand pardon,” said Poirot humbly. “But, if my memory is not\\nat fault, in the case of a recent murder, the doctor first gave a\\nverdict of heart failure—altering it when the local constable\\npointed out that there was a bullet wound through the head!”\\n\\n“You will not find any bullet wounds on the body of Mr. Maltravers,”\\nsaid Dr. Bernard dryly. “Now, gentlemen, if there is nothing\\nfurther——”\\n\\nWe took the hint.\\n\\n“Good morning, and many thanks to you, doctor, for so kindly\\nanswering our questions. By the way, you saw no need for an\\nautopsy?”\\n\\n“Certainly not.” The doctor became quite apoplectic. “The cause of\\ndeath was clear, and in my profession we see no need to distress\\nunduly the relatives of a dead patient.”\\n\\nAnd, turning, the doctor slammed the door sharply in our faces.\\n\\n“And what do you think of Dr. Bernard, Hastings?” inquired Poirot,\\nas we proceeded on our way to the Manor.\\n\\n“Rather an old ass.”\\n\\n“Exactly. Your judgments of character are always profound, my\\nfriend.”\\n\\nI glanced at him uneasily, but he seemed perfectly serious. A\\ntwinkle, however, came into his eye, and he added slyly:\\n\\n“That is to say, when there is no question of a beautiful woman!”\\n\\nI looked at him coldly.\\n\\nOn our arrival at the manor-house, the door was opened to us by a\\nmiddle-aged parlourmaid. Poirot handed her his card, and a letter\\nfrom the Insurance Company for Mrs. Maltravers. She showed us into\\na small morning-room, and retired to tell her mistress. About ten\\nminutes elapsed, and then the door opened, and a slender figure in\\nwidow’s weeds stood upon the threshold.\\n\\n“Monsieur Poirot?” she faltered.\\n\\n“Madame!” Poirot sprang gallantly to his feet and hastened towards\\nher. “I cannot tell you how I regret to derange you in this way.\\nBut what will you? _Les affaires_—they know no mercy.”\\n\\nMrs. Maltravers permitted him to lead her to a chair. Her eyes were\\nred with weeping, but the temporary disfigurement could not conceal\\nher extraordinary beauty. She was about twenty-seven or eight, and\\nvery fair, with large blue eyes and a pretty pouting mouth.\\n\\n“It is something about my husband’s insurance, is it? But must I\\nbe bothered _now_—so soon?”\\n\\n“Courage, my dear Madame. Courage! You see, your late husband\\ninsured his life for rather a large sum, and in such a case the\\nCompany always has to satisfy itself as to a few details. They have\\nempowered me to act for them. You can rest assured that I will do\\nall in my power to render the matter not too unpleasant for you.\\nWill you recount to me briefly the sad events of Wednesday?”\\n\\n“I was changing for tea when my maid came up—one of the gardeners\\nhad just run to the house. He had found——”\\n\\nHer voice trailed away. Poirot pressed her hand sympathetically.\\n\\n“I comprehend. Enough! You had seen your husband earlier in the\\nafternoon?”\\n\\n“Not since lunch. I had walked down to the village for some stamps,\\nand I believe he was out pottering round the grounds.”\\n\\n“Shooting rooks, eh?”\\n\\n“Yes, he usually took his little rook rifle with him, and I heard\\none or two shots in the distance.”\\n\\n“Where is this little rook rifle now?”\\n\\n“In the hall, I think.”\\n\\nShe led the way out of the room and found and handed the little\\nweapon to Poirot, who examined it cursorily.\\n\\n“Two shots fired, I see,” he observed, as he handed it back. “And\\nnow, madame, if I might see——”\\n\\nHe paused delicately.\\n\\n“The servant shall take you,” she murmured, averting her head.\\n\\nThe parlourmaid, summoned, led Poirot upstairs. I remained with\\nthe lovely and unfortunate woman. It was hard to know whether to\\nspeak or remain silent. I essayed one or two general reflections\\nto which she responded absently, and in a very few minutes Poirot\\nrejoined us.\\n\\n“I thank you for all your courtesy, madame. I do not think you need\\nbe troubled any further with this matter. By the way, do you know\\nanything of your husband’s financial position?”\\n\\nShe shook her head.\\n\\n“Nothing whatever. I am very stupid over business things.”\\n\\n“I see. Then you can give us no clue as to why he suddenly decided\\nto insure his life? He had not done so previously, I understand.”\\n\\n“Well, we had only been married a little over a year. But, as to\\nwhy he insured his life, it was because he had absolutely made up\\nhis mind that he would not live long. He had a strong premonition\\nof his own death. I gather that he had had one hæmorrhage already,\\nand that he knew that another one would prove fatal. I tried to\\ndispel these gloomy fears of his, but without avail. Alas, he was\\nonly too right!”\\n\\nTears in her eyes, she bade us a dignified farewell. Poirot made\\na characteristic gesture as we walked down the drive together.\\n\\n“_Eh bien_, that is that! Back to London, my friend, there appears\\nto be no mouse in this mouse-hole. And yet——”\\n\\n“Yet what?”\\n\\n“A slight discrepancy, that is all! You noticed it? You did not?\\nStill, life is full of discrepancies, and assuredly the man cannot\\nhave taken his own life—there is no poison that would fill his\\nmouth with blood. No, no, I must resign myself to the fact that\\nall here is clear and above-board—but who is this?”\\n\\nA tall young man was striding up the drive towards us. He passed\\nus without making any sign, but I noted that he was not ill-looking,\\nwith a lean, deeply bronzed face that spoke of life in a tropic\\nclime. A gardener who was sweeping up leaves had paused for a\\nminute in his task, and Poirot ran quickly up to him.\\n\\n“Tell me, I pray you, who is that gentleman? Do you know him?”\\n\\n“I don’t remember his name, sir, though I did hear it. He was\\nstaying down here last week for a night. Tuesday, it was.”\\n\\n“Quick, _mon ami_, let us follow him.”\\n\\nWe hastened up the drive after the retreating figure. A glimpse of\\na black-robed figure on the terrace at the side of the house, and\\nour quarry swerved and we after him, so that we were witnesses of\\nthe meeting.\\n\\nMrs. Maltravers almost staggered where she stood, and her face\\nblanched noticeably.\\n\\n“You,” she gasped. “I thought you were on the sea—on your way to\\nEast Africa?”\\n\\n“I got some news from my lawyers that detained me,” explained the\\nyoung man. “My old uncle in Scotland died unexpectedly and left me\\nsome money. Under the circumstances I thought it better to cancel\\nmy passage. Then I saw this bad news in the paper and I came down\\nto see if there was anything I could do. You’ll want some one to\\nlook after things for you a bit perhaps.”\\n\\nAt that moment they became aware of our presence. Poirot stepped\\nforward, and with many apologies explained that he had left his\\nstick in the hall. Rather reluctantly, it seemed to me, Mrs.\\nMaltravers made the necessary introduction.\\n\\n“Monsieur Poirot, Captain Black.”\\n\\nA few minutes’ chat ensued, in the course of which Poirot elicited\\nthe fact that Captain Black was putting up at the Anchor Inn. The\\nmissing stick not having been discovered (which was not surprising),\\nPoirot uttered more apologies and we withdrew.\\n\\nWe returned to the village at a great pace, and Poirot made a bee\\nline for the Anchor Inn.\\n\\n“Here we establish ourselves until our friend the Captain returns,”\\nhe explained. “You notice that I emphasized the point that we were\\nreturning to London by the first train? Possibly you thought I\\nmeant it. But no—you observed Mrs. Maltravers’ face when she caught\\nsight of this young Black? She was clearly taken aback, and he—_eh\\nbien_, he was very devoted, did you not think so? And he was here\\non Tuesday night—the day before Mr. Maltravers died. We must\\ninvestigate the doings of Captain Black, Hastings.”\\n\\nIn about half an hour we espied our quarry approaching the inn.\\nPoirot went out and accosted him and presently brought him up to\\nthe room we had engaged.\\n\\n“I have been telling Captain Black of the mission which brings us\\nhere,” he explained. “You can understand, _monsieur le capitaine_,\\nthat I am anxious to arrive at Mr. Maltravers’ state of mind\\nimmediately before his death, and that at the same time I do not\\nwish to distress Mrs. Maltravers unduly by asking her painful\\nquestions. Now, you were here just before the occurrence, and can\\ngive us equally valuable information.”\\n\\n“I’ll do anything I can to help you, I’m sure,” replied the young\\nsoldier; “but I’m afraid I didn’t notice anything out of the\\nordinary. You see, although Maltravers was an old friend of my\\npeople’s, I didn’t know him very well myself.”\\n\\n“You came down—when?”\\n\\n“Tuesday afternoon. I went up to town early Wednesday morning, as\\nmy boat sailed from Tilbury about twelve o’clock. But some news I\\ngot made me alter my plans, as I dare say you heard me explain to\\nMrs. Maltravers.”\\n\\n“You were returning to East Africa, I understand?”\\n\\n“Yes. I’ve been out there ever since the War—a great country.”\\n\\n“Exactly. Now what was the talk about at dinner on Tuesday night?”\\n\\n“Oh, I don’t know. The usual odd topics. Maltravers asked after my\\npeople, and then we discussed the question of German reparations,\\nand then Mrs. Maltravers asked a lot of questions about East\\nAfrica, and I told them one or two yarns, that’s about all, I\\nthink.”\\n\\n“Thank you.”\\n\\nPoirot was silent for a moment, then he said gently: “With your\\npermission, I should like to try a little experiment. You have told\\nus all that your conscious self knows, I want now to question your\\nsubconscious self.”\\n\\n“Psychoanalysis, what?” said Black, with visible alarm.\\n\\n“Oh, no,” said Poirot reassuringly. “You see, it is like this, I\\ngive you a word, you answer with another, and so on. Any word, the\\nfirst one you think of. Shall we begin?”\\n\\n“All right,” said Black slowly, but he looked uneasy.\\n\\n“Note down the words, please, Hastings,” said Poirot. Then he took\\nfrom his pocket his big turnip-faced watch and laid it on the table\\nbeside him. “We will commence. Day.”\\n\\nThere was a moment’s pause, and then Black replied:\\n\\n“_Night_.”\\n\\nAs Poirot proceeded, his answers came quicker.\\n\\n“Name,” said Poirot.\\n\\n“_Place_.”\\n\\n“Bernard.”\\n\\n“_Shaw_.”\\n\\n“Tuesday.”\\n\\n“_Dinner_.”\\n\\n“Journey.”\\n\\n“_Ship_.”\\n\\n“Country.”\\n\\n“_Uganda_.”\\n\\n“Story.”\\n\\n“_Lions_.”\\n\\n“Rook Rifle.”\\n\\n“_Farm_.”\\n\\n“Shot.”\\n\\n“_Suicide_.”\\n\\n“Elephant.”\\n\\n“_Tusks_.”\\n\\n“Money.”\\n\\n“_Lawyers_.”\\n\\n“Thank you, Captain Black. Perhaps you could spare me a few minutes\\nin about half an hour’s time?”\\n\\n“Certainly.” The young soldier looked at him curiously and wiped\\nhis brow as he got up.\\n\\n“And now, Hastings,” said Poirot, smiling at me as the door closed\\nbehind him. “You see it all, do you not?”\\n\\n“I don’t know what you mean.”\\n\\n“Does that list of words tell you nothing?”\\n\\nI scrutinized it, but was forced to shake my head.\\n\\n“I will assist you. To begin with, Black answered well within the\\nnormal time limit, with no pauses, so we can take it that he\\nhimself has no guilty knowledge to conceal. ‘Day’ to ‘Night’ and\\n‘Place’ to ‘Name’ are normal associations. I began work with\\n‘Bernard’ which might have suggested the local doctor had he come\\nacross him at all. Evidently he had not. After our recent\\nconversation, he gave ‘Dinner’ to my ‘Tuesday,’ but ‘Journey’ and\\n‘Country’ were answered by ‘Ship’ and ‘Uganda,’ showing clearly\\nthat it was his journey abroad that was important to him and not\\nthe one which brought him down here. ‘Story’ recalls to him one of\\nthe ‘Lion’ stories he told at dinner. I proceed to ‘Rook Rifle’\\nand he answered with the totally unexpected word ‘Farm.’ When I\\nsay ‘Shot,’ he answers at once ‘Suicide.’ The association seems\\nclear. A man he knows committed suicide with a rook rifle on a farm\\nsomewhere. Remember, too, that his mind is still on the stories he\\ntold at dinner, and I think you will agree that I shall not be far\\nfrom the truth if I recall Captain Black and ask him to repeat the\\nparticular suicide story which he told at the dinner-table on\\nTuesday evening.”\\n\\nBlack was straightforward enough over the matter.\\n\\n“Yes, I did tell them that story now that I come to think of it.\\nChap shot himself on a farm out there. Did it with a rook rifle\\nthrough the roof of the mouth, bullet lodged in the brain. Doctors\\nwere no end puzzled over it—there was nothing to show except a\\nlittle blood on the lips. But what——”\\n\\n“What has it got to do with Mr. Maltravers? You did not know, I\\nsee, that he was found with a rook rifle by his side.”\\n\\n“You mean my story suggested to him—oh, but that is awful!”\\n\\n“Do not distress yourself—it would have been one way or another.\\nWell, I must get on the telephone to London.”\\n\\nPoirot had a lengthy conversation over the wire, and came back\\nthoughtful. He went off by himself in the afternoon, and it was\\nnot till seven o’clock that he announced that he could put it off\\nno longer, but must break the news to the young widow. My sympathy\\nhad already gone out to her unreservedly. To be left penniless,\\nand with the knowledge that her husband had killed himself to\\nassure her future was a hard burden for any woman to bear. I\\ncherished a secret hope, however, that young Black might prove\\ncapable of consoling her after her first grief had passed. He\\nevidently admired her enormously.\\n\\nOur interview with the lady was painful. She refused vehemently to\\nbelieve the facts that Poirot advanced, and when she was at last\\nconvinced broke down into bitter weeping. An examination of the\\nbody turned our suspicions into certainty. Poirot was very sorry\\nfor the poor lady, but, after all, he was employed by the Insurance\\nCompany, and what could he do? As he was preparing to leave he said\\ngently to Mrs. Maltravers:\\n\\n“Madame, you of all people should know that there are no dead!”\\n\\n“What do you mean?” she faltered, her eyes growing wide.\\n\\n“Have you never taken part in any spiritualistic séances? You are\\nmediumistic, you know.”\\n\\n“I have been told so. But you do not believe in Spiritualism,\\nsurely?”\\n\\n“Madame, I have seen some strange things. You know that they say\\nin the village that this house is haunted?”\\n\\nShe nodded, and at that moment the parlourmaid announced that\\ndinner was ready.\\n\\n“Won’t you just stay and have something to eat?”\\n\\nWe accepted gratefully, and I felt that our presence could not but\\nhelp distract her a little from her own griefs.\\n\\nWe had just finished our soup, when there was a scream outside the\\ndoor, and the sound of breaking crockery. We jumped up. The\\nparlourmaid appeared, her hand to her heart.\\n\\n“It was a man—standing in the passage.”\\n\\nPoirot rushed out, returning quickly.\\n\\n“There is no one there.”\\n\\n“Isn’t there, sir?” said the parlourmaid weakly. “Oh, it did give\\nme a start!”\\n\\n“But why?”\\n\\nShe dropped her voice to a whisper.\\n\\n“I thought—I thought it was the master—it looked like ’im.”\\n\\nI saw Mrs. Maltravers give a terrified start, and my mind flew to\\nthe old superstition that a suicide cannot rest. She thought of it\\ntoo, I am sure, for a minute later, she caught Poirot’s arm with\\na scream.\\n\\n“Didn’t you hear that? Those three taps on the window? That’s how\\n_he_ always used to tap when he passed round the house.”\\n\\n“The ivy,” I cried. “It was the ivy against the pane.”\\n\\nBut a sort of terror was gaining on us all. The parlourmaid was\\nobviously unstrung, and when the meal was over Mrs. Maltravers\\nbesought Poirot not to go at once. She was clearly terrified to be\\nleft alone. We sat in the little morning-room. The wind was getting\\nup, and moaning round the house in an eerie fashion. Twice the door\\nof the room came unlatched and the door slowly opened, and each\\ntime she clung to me with a terrified gasp.\\n\\n“Ah, but this door, it is bewitched!” cried\\n\\nPoirot angrily at last. He got up and shut it once more, then\\nturned the key in the lock. “I shall lock it, so!”\\n\\n“Don’t do that,” she gasped, “if it should come open now——”\\n\\nAnd even as she spoke the impossible happened. The locked door\\nslowly swung open. I could not see into the passage from where I\\nsat, but she and Poirot were facing it. She gave one long shriek\\nas she turned to him.\\n\\n“You saw him—there in the passage?” she cried.\\n\\nHe was staring down at her with a puzzled face, then shook his\\nhead.\\n\\n“I saw him—my husband—you must have seen him too?”\\n\\n“Madame, I saw nothing. You are not well—unstrung——”\\n\\n“I am perfectly well, I——Oh, God!”\\n\\nSuddenly, without any warning, the lights quivered and went out.\\nOut of the darkness came three loud raps. I could hear Mrs.\\nMaltravers moaning.\\n\\nAnd then—I saw!\\n\\nThe man I had seen on the bed upstairs stood there facing us,\\ngleaming with a faint ghostly light. There was blood on his lips,\\nand he held his right hand out, pointing. Suddenly a brilliant\\nlight seemed to proceed from it. It passed over Poirot and me, and\\nfell on Mrs. Maltravers. I saw her white terrified face, and\\nsomething else!\\n\\n“My God, Poirot!” I cried. “Look at her hand, her right hand. It’s\\nall red!”\\n\\nHer own eyes fell on it, and she collapsed in a heap on the floor.\\n\\n“Blood,” she cried hysterically. “Yes, it’s blood. I killed him.\\nI did it. He was showing me, and then I put my hand on the trigger\\nand pressed. Save me from him—save me! he’s come back!”\\n\\nHer voice died away in a gurgle.\\n\\n“Lights,” said Poirot briskly.\\n\\nThe lights went on as if by magic.\\n\\n“That’s it,” he continued. “You heard, Hastings? And you, Everett?\\nOh, by the way, this is Mr. Everett, rather a fine member of the\\ntheatrical profession. I ’phoned to him this afternoon. His make-up\\nis good, isn’t it? Quite like the dead man, and with a pocket torch\\nand the necessary phosphorescence he made the proper impression.\\nI shouldn’t touch her right hand if I were you, Hastings. Red paint\\nmarks so. When the lights went out I clasped her hand, you see. By\\nthe way, we mustn’t miss our train. Inspector Japp is outside the\\nwindow. A bad night—but he has been able to while away the time by\\ntapping on the window every now and then.”\\n\\n“You see,” continued Poirot, as we walked briskly through the wind\\nand rain, “there was a little discrepancy. The doctor seemed to\\nthink the deceased was a Christian Scientist, and who could have\\ngiven him that impression but Mrs. Maltravers? But to us she\\nrepresented him as being in a grave state of apprehension about\\nhis own health. Again, why was she so taken aback by the reappearance\\nof young Black? And lastly, although I know that convention decrees\\nthat a woman must make a decent pretence of mourning for her\\nhusband, I do not care for such heavily-rouged eyelids! You did\\nnot observe them, Hastings? No? As I always tell you, you see\\nnothing!”\\n\\n“Well, there it was. There were the two possibilities. Did Black’s\\nstory suggest an ingenious method of committing suicide to Mr.\\nMaltravers, or did his other listener, the wife, see an equally\\ningenious method of committing murder? I inclined to the latter\\nview. To shoot himself in the way indicated, he would probably have\\nhad to pull the trigger with his toe—or at least so I imagine.\\nNow if Maltravers had been found with one boot off, we should\\nalmost certainly have heard of it from some one. An odd detail like\\nthat would have been remembered.\\n\\n“No, as I say, I inclined to the view that it was a case of murder,\\nnot suicide, but I realized that I had not a shadow of proof in\\nsupport of my theory. Hence the elaborate little comedy you saw\\nplayed to-night.”\\n\\n“Even now I don’t quite see all the details of the crime?” I said.\\n\\n“Let us start from the beginning. Here is a shrewd and scheming\\nwoman who, knowing of her husband’s financial _débâcle_ and tired\\nof the elderly mate she has only married for his money, induces\\nhim to insure his life for a large sum, and then seeks for the\\nmeans to accomplish her purpose. An accident gives her that—the\\nyoung soldier’s strange story. The next afternoon when _monsieur\\nle capitaine_, as she thinks, is on the high seas, she and her\\nhusband are strolling round the grounds. ‘What a curious story that\\nwas last night!’ she observes. ‘Could a man shoot himself in such\\na way? Do show me if it is possible!’ The poor fool—he shows her.\\nHe places the end of the rifle in his mouth. She stoops down, and\\nputs her finger on the trigger, laughing up at him. ‘And now, sir,’\\nshe says saucily, ‘supposing I pull the trigger?’\\n\\n“And then—and then, Hastings—she pulls it!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  III\\n\\n\\n  The Adventure of the Cheap Flat\\n\\n\\nSo far, in the cases which I have recorded, Poirot’s investigations\\nhave started from the central fact, whether murder or robbery, and\\nhave proceeded from thence by a process of logical deduction to\\nthe final triumphant unravelling. In the events I am now about to\\nchronicle, a remarkable chain of circumstances led from the\\napparently trivial incidents which first attracted Poirot’s\\nattention to the sinister happenings which completed a most unusual\\ncase.\\n\\nI had been spending the evening with an old friend of mine, Gerald\\nParker. There had been, perhaps, about half a dozen people there\\nbesides my host and myself, and the talk fell, as it was bound to\\ndo sooner or later wherever Parker found himself, on the subject\\nof house-hunting in London. Houses and flats were Parker’s special\\nhobby. Since the end of the War, he had occupied at least half a\\ndozen different flats and maisonnettes. No sooner was he settled\\nanywhere than he would light unexpectedly upon a new find, and\\nwould forthwith depart bag and baggage. His moves were nearly\\nalways accomplished at a slight pecuniary gain, for he had a shrewd\\nbusiness head, but it was sheer love of the sport that actuated\\nhim, and not a desire to make money at it. We listened to Parker\\nfor some time with the respect of the novice for the expert. Then\\nit was our turn, and a perfect babel of tongues was let loose.\\nFinally the floor was left to Mrs. Robinson, a charming little\\nbride who was there with her husband. I had never met them before,\\nas Robinson was only a recent acquaintance of Parker’s.\\n\\n“Talking of flats,” she said, “have you heard of our piece of luck,\\nMr. Parker? We’ve got a flat—at last! In Montagu Mansions.”\\n\\n“Well,” said Parker, “I’ve always said there are plenty of flats—at\\na price!”\\n\\n“Yes, but this isn’t at a price. It’s dirt cheap. Eighty pounds a\\nyear!”\\n\\n“But—but Montagu Mansions is just off Knightsbridge, isn’t it? Big\\nhandsome building. Or are you talking of a poor relation of the\\nsame name stuck in the slums somewhere?”\\n\\n“No, it’s the Knightsbridge one. That’s what makes it so wonderful.”\\n\\n“Wonderful is the word! It’s a blinking miracle. But there must be\\na catch somewhere. Big premium, I suppose?”\\n\\n“No premium!”\\n\\n“No prem—oh, hold my head, somebody!” groaned Parker.\\n\\n“But we’ve got to buy the furniture,” continued Mrs. Robinson.\\n\\n“Ah!” Parker brisked up. “I knew there was a catch!”\\n\\n“For fifty pounds. And it’s beautifully furnished!”\\n\\n“I give it up,” said Parker. “The present occupants must be lunatics\\nwith a taste for philanthropy.”\\n\\nMrs. Robinson was looking a little troubled. A little pucker\\nappeared between her dainty brows.\\n\\n“It _is_ queer, isn’t it? You don’t think that—that—the place is\\n_haunted_?”\\n\\n“Never heard of a haunted flat,” declared Parker decisively.\\n\\n“N-o.” Mrs. Robinson appeared far from convinced. “But there were\\nseveral things about it all that struck me as—well, queer.”\\n\\n“For instance——” I suggested.\\n\\n“Ah,” said Parker, “our criminal expert’s attention is aroused!\\nUnburden yourself to him, Mrs. Robinson. Hastings is a great\\nunraveller of mysteries.”\\n\\nI laughed, embarrassed but not wholly displeased with the rôle\\nthrust upon me.\\n\\n“Oh, not really queer, Captain Hastings, but when we went to the\\nagents, Stosser and Paul—we hadn’t tried them before because they\\nonly have the expensive Mayfair flats, but we thought at any rate\\nit would do no harm—everything they offered us was four and five\\nhundred a year, or else huge premiums, and then, just as we were\\ngoing, they mentioned that they had a flat at eighty, but that they\\ndoubted if it would be any good our going there, because it had\\nbeen on their books some time and they had sent so many people to\\nsee it that it was almost sure to be taken—‘snapped up’ as the\\nclerk put it—only people were so tiresome in not letting them know,\\nand then they went on sending, and people get annoyed at being sent\\nto a place that had, perhaps, been let some time.”\\n\\nMrs. Robinson paused for some much needed breath, and then\\ncontinued: “We thanked him, and said that we quite\\nunderstood it would probably be no good, but that we should\\nlike an order all the same—just in case. And we went there\\nstraight away in a taxi, for, after all, you never know. No.\\n4 was on the second floor, and just as we were waiting for\\nthe lift, Elsie Ferguson—she’s a friend of mine, Captain\\nHastings, and they are looking for a flat too—came hurrying\\ndown the stairs. ‘Ahead of you for once, my dear,’ she said.\\n‘But it’s no good. It’s already let.’ That seemed to finish\\nit, but—well, as John said, the place was very cheap, we\\ncould afford to give more, and perhaps if we offered a\\npremium.——A horrid thing to do, of course, and I feel quite\\nashamed of telling you, but you know what flat-hunting is.”\\n\\nI assured her that I was well aware that in the struggle for\\nhouse-room the baser side of human nature frequently triumphed over\\nthe higher, and that the well-known rule of dog eat dog always\\napplied.\\n\\n“So we went up and, would you believe it, the flat wasn’t let at\\nall. We were shown over it by the maid, and then we saw the\\nmistress, and the thing was settled then and there. Immediate\\npossession and fifty pounds for the furniture. We signed the\\nagreement next day, and we are to move in to-morrow!” Mrs. Robinson\\npaused triumphantly.\\n\\n“And what about Mrs. Ferguson?” asked Parker. “Let’s have your\\ndeductions, Hastings.”\\n\\n“‘Obvious, my dear Watson,’” I quoted lightly. “She went to the\\nwrong flat.”\\n\\n“Oh, Captain Hastings, how clever of you!” cried Mrs. Robinson\\nadmiringly.\\n\\nI rather wished Poirot had been there. Sometimes I have the feeling\\nthat he rather underestimates my capabilities.\\n\\n\\n  •   •   •   •   •   •   •\\n\\n\\nThe whole thing was rather amusing, and I propounded the thing as\\na mock problem to Poirot on the following morning. He seemed\\ninterested, and questioned me rather narrowly as to the rents of\\nflats in various localities.\\n\\n“A curious story,” he said thoughtfully. “Excuse me, Hastings, I\\nmust take a short stroll.”\\n\\nWhen he returned, about an hour later, his eyes were gleaming with\\na peculiar excitement. He laid his stick on the table, and brushed\\nthe nap of his hat with his usual tender care before he spoke.\\n\\n“It is as well, _mon ami_, that we have no affairs of moment on\\nhand. We can devote ourselves wholly to the present investigation.”\\n\\n“What investigation are you talking about?”\\n\\n“The remarkable cheapness of your friend’s, Mrs. Robinson’s, new\\nflat.”\\n\\n“Poirot, you are not serious!”\\n\\n“I am most serious. Figure to yourself, my friend, that the real\\nrent of those flats is £350. I have just ascertained that from the\\nlandlord’s agents. And yet this particular flat is being sublet at\\neighty pounds! Why?”\\n\\n“There must be something wrong with it. Perhaps it is haunted, as\\nMrs. Robinson suggested.”\\n\\nPoirot shook his head in a dissatisfied manner.\\n\\n“Then again how curious it is that her friend tells her the flat\\nis let, and, when she goes up, behold, it is not so at all!”\\n\\n“But surely you agree with me that the other woman must have gone\\nto the wrong flat. That is the only possible solution.”\\n\\n“You may or may not be right on that point, Hastings. The fact\\nstill remains that numerous other applicants were sent to see it,\\nand yet, in spite of its remarkable cheapness, it was still in the\\nmarket when Mrs. Robinson arrived.”\\n\\n“That shows that there must be something wrong about it.”\\n\\n“Mrs. Robinson did not seem to notice anything amiss. Very curious,\\nis it not? Did she impress you as being a truthful woman, Hastings?”\\n\\n“She was a delightful creature!”\\n\\n“_Évidemment!_ since she renders you incapable of replying to my\\nquestion. Describe her to me, then.”\\n\\n“Well, she’s tall and fair; her hair’s really a beautiful shade of\\nauburn——”\\n\\n“Always you have had a penchant for auburn hair!” murmured Poirot.\\n“But continue.”\\n\\n“Blue eyes and a very nice complexion and—well, that’s all, I\\nthink,” I concluded lamely.\\n\\n“And her husband?”\\n\\n“Oh, he’s quite a nice fellow—nothing startling.”\\n\\n“Dark or fair?”\\n\\n“I don’t know—betwixt and between, and just an ordinary sort of\\nface.”\\n\\nPoirot nodded.\\n\\n“Yes, there are hundreds of these average men—and, anyway, you\\nbring more sympathy and appreciation to your description of women.\\nDo you know anything about these people? Does Parker know them\\nwell.”\\n\\n“They are just recent acquaintances, I believe. But surely, Poirot,\\nyou don’t think for an instant——”\\n\\nPoirot raised his hand.\\n\\n“_Tout doucement, mon ami_. Have I said that I think anything? All\\nI say is—it is a curious story. And there is nothing to throw light\\nupon it; except perhaps the lady’s name, eh, Hastings?”\\n\\n“Her name is Stella,” I said stiffly, “but I don’t see——”\\n\\nPoirot interrupted me with a tremendous chuckle. Something seemed\\nto be amusing him vastly.\\n\\n“And Stella means a star, does it not? Famous!”\\n\\n“What on earth——”\\n\\n“And stars give light! _Voilà!_ Calm yourself, Hastings. Do not\\nput on that air of injured dignity. Come, we will go to Montagu\\nMansions and make a few inquiries.”\\n\\nI accompanied him, nothing loath. The Mansions were a handsome\\nblock of buildings in excellent repair. A uniformed porter was\\nsunning himself on the threshold, and it was to him that Poirot\\naddressed himself:\\n\\n“Pardon, but could you tell me if a Mr. and Mrs. Robinson reside\\nhere?”\\n\\nThe porter was a man of few words and apparently of a sour or\\nsuspicious disposition. He hardly looked at us and grunted out:\\n\\n“No. 4. Second floor.”\\n\\n“I thank you. Can you tell me how long they have been here?”\\n\\n“Six months.”\\n\\nI started forward in amazement, conscious as I did so of Poirot’s\\nmalicious grin.\\n\\n“Impossible,” I cried. “You must be making a mistake.”\\n\\n“Six months.”\\n\\n“Are you sure? The lady I mean is tall and fair with reddish gold\\nhair and——”\\n\\n“That’s ’er,” said the porter. “Come in the Michaelmas quarter,\\nthey did. Just six months ago.”\\n\\nHe appeared to lose interest in us and retreated slowly up the\\nhall. I followed Poirot outside.\\n\\n“_Eh bien_, Hastings?” my friend demanded slyly. “Are you so sure\\nnow that delightful women always speak the truth?”\\n\\nI did not reply.\\n\\nPoirot had steered his way into Brompton Road before I asked him\\nwhat he was going to do and where we were going.\\n\\n“To the house agents, Hastings. I have a great desire to have a\\nflat in Montagu Mansions. If I am not mistaken, several interesting\\nthings will take place there before long.”\\n\\nWe were fortunate in our quest. No. 8, on the fourth floor, was to\\nbe let furnished at ten guineas a week. Poirot promptly took it\\nfor a month. Outside in the street again, he silenced my protests:\\n\\n“But I make money nowadays! Why should I not indulge a whim? By\\nthe way, Hastings, have you a revolver?”\\n\\n“Yes—somewhere,” I answered, slightly thrilled. “Do you think——”\\n\\n“That you will need it? It is quite possible. The idea pleases you,\\nI see. Always the spectacular and romantic appeals to you.”\\n\\nThe following day saw us installed in our temporary home. The flat\\nwas pleasantly furnished. It occupied the same position in the\\nbuilding as that of the Robinsons, but was two floors higher.\\n\\nThe day after our installation was a Sunday. In the afternoon,\\nPoirot left the front door ajar, and summoned me hastily as a bang\\nreverberated from somewhere below.\\n\\n“Look over the banisters. Are those your friends. Do not let them\\nsee you.”\\n\\nI craned my neck over the staircase.\\n\\n“That’s them,” I declared in an ungrammatical whisper.\\n\\n“Good. Wait awhile.”\\n\\nAbout half an hour later, a young woman emerged in brilliant and\\nvaried clothing. With a sigh of satisfaction, Poirot tiptoed back\\ninto the flat.\\n\\n“_C’est ça_. After the master and mistress, the maid. The flat\\nshould now be empty.”\\n\\n“What are we going to do?” I asked uneasily.\\n\\nPoirot had trotted briskly into the scullery and was hauling at\\nthe rope of the coal-lift.\\n\\n“We are about to descend after the method of the dustbins,” he\\nexplained cheerfully. “No one will observe us. The Sunday concert,\\nthe Sunday ‘afternoon out,’ and finally the Sunday nap after the\\nSunday dinner of England—_le rosbif_—all these will distract\\nattention from the doings of Hercule Poirot. Come, my friend.”\\n\\nHe stepped into the rough wooden contrivance and I followed him\\ngingerly.\\n\\n“Are we going to break into the flat?” I asked dubiously.\\n\\nPoirot’s answer was not too reassuring:\\n\\n“Not precisely to-day,” he replied.\\n\\nPulling on the rope, we descended slowly till we reached the second\\nfloor. Poirot uttered an exclamation of satisfaction as he perceived\\nthat the wooden door into the scullery was open.\\n\\n“You observe? Never do they bolt these doors in the daytime. And\\nyet anyone could mount or descend as we have done. At night\\nyes—though not always then—and it is against that that we are going\\nto make provision.”\\n\\nHe had drawn some tools from his pocket as he spoke, and at once\\nset deftly to work, his object being to arrange the bolt so that\\nit could be pulled back from the lift. The operation only occupied\\nabout three minutes. Then Poirot returned the tools to his pocket,\\nand we reascended once more to our own domain.\\n\\n\\n  •   •   •   •   •   •   •\\n\\n\\nOn Monday Poirot was out all day, but when he returned in the\\nevening he flung himself into his chair with a sigh of satisfaction.\\n\\n“Hastings, shall I recount to you a little history? A story after\\nyour own heart and which will remind you of your favourite cinema?”\\n\\n“Go ahead,” I laughed. “I presume that it is a true story, not one\\nof your efforts of fancy.”\\n\\n“It is true enough. Inspector Japp of Scotland Yard will vouch for\\nits accuracy, since it was through his kind offices that it came\\nto my ears. Listen, Hastings. A little over six months ago some\\nimportant Naval plans were stolen from an American Government\\ndepartment. They showed the position of some of the most important\\nHarbour defences, and would be worth a considerable sum to any\\nforeign Government—that of Japan, for example. Suspicion fell upon\\na young man named Luigi Valdarno, an Italian by birth, who was\\nemployed in a minor capacity in the Department and who was missing\\nat the same time as the papers. Whether Luigi Valdarno was the\\nthief or not, he was found two days later on the East Side in New\\nYork, shot dead. The papers were not on him. Now for some time past\\nLuigi Valdarno had been going about with a Miss Elsa Hardt, a young\\nconcert singer who had recently appeared and who lived with a\\nbrother in an apartment in Washington. Nothing was known of the\\nantecedents of Miss Elsa Hardt, and she disappeared suddenly about\\nthe time of Valdarno’s death. There are reasons for believing that\\nshe was in reality an accomplished international spy who has done\\nmuch nefarious work under various _aliases_. The American Secret\\nService, whilst doing their best to trace her, also kept an eye\\nupon certain insignificant Japanese gentlemen living in Washington.\\nThey felt pretty certain that, when Elsa Hardt had covered her\\ntracks sufficiently, she would approach the gentlemen in question.\\nOne of them left suddenly for England a fortnight ago. On the face\\nof it, therefore, it would seem that Elsa Hardt is in England.”\\nPoirot paused, and then added softly: “The official description of\\nElsa Hardt is: Height 5 ft. 7, eyes blue, hair auburn, fair\\ncomplexion, nose straight, no special distinguishing marks.”\\n\\n“Mrs. Robinson!” I gasped.\\n\\n“Well, there is a chance of it, anyhow,” amended Poirot. “Also, I\\nlearn that a swarthy man, a foreigner of some kind, was inquiring\\nabout the occupants of No. 4 only this morning. Therefore, _mon\\nami_, I fear that you must forswear your beauty sleep to-night,\\nand join me in my all-night vigil in the flat below—armed with that\\nexcellent revolver of yours, _bien entendu_!”\\n\\n“Rather,” I cried with enthusiasm. “When shall we start?”\\n\\n“The hour of midnight is both solemn and suitable, I fancy. Nothing\\nis likely to occur before then.”\\n\\nAt twelve o’clock precisely, we crept cautiously into the coal-lift\\nand lowered ourselves to the second floor. Under Poirot’s\\nmanipulation, the wooden door quickly swung inwards, and we climbed\\ninto the flat. From the scullery we passed into the kitchen where\\nwe established ourselves comfortably in two chairs with the door\\ninto the hall ajar.\\n\\n“Now we have but to wait,” said Poirot contentedly, closing his\\neyes.\\n\\nTo me, the waiting appeared endless. I was terrified of going to\\nsleep. Just when it seemed to me that I had been there about eight\\nhours—and had, as I found out afterwards, in reality been exactly\\none hour and twenty minutes—a faint scratching sound came to my\\nears. Poirot’s hand touched mine. I rose, and together we moved\\ncarefully in the direction of the hall. The noise came from there.\\nPoirot placed his lips to my ear.\\n\\n“Outside the front door. They are cutting out the lock. When I give\\nthe word, not before, fall upon him from behind and hold him fast.\\nBe careful, he will have a knife.”\\n\\nPresently there was a rending sound, and a little circle of light\\nappeared through the door. It was extinguished immediately and then\\nthe door was slowly opened. Poirot and I flattened ourselves\\nagainst the wall. I heard a man’s breathing as he passed us. Then\\nhe flashed on his torch, and as he did so, Poirot hissed in my ear:\\n\\n“_Allez_.”\\n\\nWe sprang together, Poirot with a quick movement enveloped the\\nintruder’s head with a light woollen scarf whilst I pinioned his\\narms. The whole affair was quick and noiseless. I twisted a dagger\\nfrom his hand, and as Poirot brought down the scarf from his eyes,\\nwhilst keeping it wound tightly round his mouth, I jerked up my\\nrevolver where he could see it and understand that resistance was\\nuseless. As he ceased to struggle Poirot put his mouth close to\\nhis ear and began to whisper rapidly. After a minute the man\\nnodded. Then enjoining silence with a movement of the hand, Poirot\\nled the way out of the flat and down the stairs. Our captive\\nfollowed, and I brought up the rear with the revolver. When we were\\nout in the street, Poirot turned to me.\\n\\n“There is a taxi waiting just round the corner. Give me the\\nrevolver. We shall not need it now.”\\n\\n“But if this fellow tries to escape?”\\n\\nPoirot smiled.\\n\\n“He will not.”\\n\\nI returned in a minute with the waiting taxi. The scarf had been\\nunwound from the stranger’s face, and I gave a start of surprise.\\n\\n“He’s not a Jap,” I ejaculated in a whisper to Poirot.\\n\\n“Observation was always your strong point, Hastings! Nothing\\nescapes you. No, the man is not a Jap. He is an Italian.”\\n\\nWe got into the taxi, and Poirot gave the driver an address in St.\\nJohn’s Wood. I was by now completely fogged. I did not like to ask\\nPoirot where we were going in front of our captive, and strove in\\nvain to obtain some light upon the proceedings.\\n\\nWe alighted at the door of a small house standing back from the\\nroad. A returning wayfarer, slightly drunk, was lurching along the\\npavement and almost collided with Poirot, who said something\\nsharply to him which I did not catch. All three of us went up the\\nsteps of the house. Poirot rang the bell and motioned us to stand\\na little aside. There was no answer and he rang again and then\\nseized the knocker which he plied for some minutes vigorously.\\n\\nA light appeared suddenly above the fanlight, and the door was\\nopened cautiously a little way.\\n\\n“What the devil do you want?” a man’s voice demanded harshly.\\n\\n“I want the doctor. My wife is taken ill.”\\n\\n“There’s no doctor here.”\\n\\nThe man prepared to shut the door, but Poirot thrust his foot in\\nadroitly. He became suddenly a perfect caricature of an infuriated\\nFrenchman.\\n\\n“What you say, there is no doctor? I will have the law of you. You\\nmust come! I will stay here and ring and knock all night.”\\n\\n“My dear sir——” The door was opened again, the man, clad in a\\ndressing-gown and slippers, stepped forward to pacify Poirot with\\nan uneasy glance round.\\n\\n“I will call the police.”\\n\\nPoirot prepared to descend the steps.\\n\\n“No, don’t do that for Heaven’s sake!” The man dashed after him.\\n\\nWith a neat push Poirot sent him staggering down the steps. In\\nanother minute all three of us were inside the door and it was\\npushed to and bolted.\\n\\n“Quick—in here.” Poirot led the way into the nearest room switching\\non the light as he did so. “And you—behind the curtain.”\\n\\n“Si, signor,” said the Italian and slid rapidly behind the full\\nfolds of rose-coloured velvet which draped the embrasure of the\\nwindow.\\n\\nNot a minute too soon. Just as he disappeared from view a woman\\nrushed into the room. She was tall with reddish hair and held a\\nscarlet kimono round her slender form.\\n\\n“Where is my husband?” she cried, with a quick frightened glance.\\n“Who are you?”\\n\\nPoirot stepped forward with a bow.\\n\\n“It is to be hoped your husband will not suffer from a chill. I\\nobserved that he had slippers on his feet, and that his dressing-gown\\nwas a warm one.”\\n\\n“Who are you? What are you doing in my house?”\\n\\n“It is true that none of us have the pleasure of your acquaintance,\\nmadame. It is especially to be regretted as one of our number has\\ncome specially from New York in order to meet you.”\\n\\nThe curtains parted and the Italian stepped out. To my horror I\\nobserved that he was brandishing my revolver, which Poirot must\\ndoubtless have put down through inadvertence in the cab.\\n\\nThe woman gave a piercing scream and turned to fly, but Poirot was\\nstanding in front of the closed door.\\n\\n“Let me by,” she shrieked. “He will murder me.”\\n\\n“Who was it dat croaked Luigi Valdarno?” asked the Italian hoarsely,\\nbrandishing the weapon, and sweeping each one of us with it. We\\ndared not move.\\n\\n“My God, Poirot, this is awful. What shall we do?” I cried.\\n\\n“You will oblige me by refraining from talking so much, Hastings.\\nI can assure you that our friend will not shoot until I give the\\nword.”\\n\\n“Youse sure o’ dat, eh?” said the Italian, leering unpleasantly.\\n\\nIt was more than I was, but the woman turned to Poirot like a\\nflash.\\n\\n“What is it you want?”\\n\\nPoirot bowed.\\n\\n“I do not think it is necessary to insult Miss Elsa Hardt’s\\nintelligence by telling her.”\\n\\nWith a swift movement, the woman snatched up a big black velvet\\ncat which served as a cover for the telephone.\\n\\n“They are stitched in the lining of that.”\\n\\n“Clever,” murmured Poirot appreciatively. He stood aside from the\\ndoor. “Good evening, madame. I will detain your friend from New\\nYork whilst you make your getaway.”\\n\\n“Whatta fool!” roared the big Italian, and raising the revolver he\\nfired point-blank at the woman’s retreating figure just as I flung\\nmyself upon him.\\n\\nBut the weapon merely clicked harmlessly and Poirot’s voice rose\\nin mild reproof.\\n\\n“Never will you trust your old friend, Hastings. I do not care for\\nmy friends to carry loaded pistols about with them and never would\\nI permit a mere acquaintance to do so. No, no, _mon ami_.” This to\\nthe Italian who swearing hoarsely. Poirot continued to address him\\nin a tone of mild reproof: “See now, what I have done for you. I\\nhave saved you from being hanged. And do not think that our\\nbeautiful lady will escape. No, no, the house is watched, back and\\nfront. Straight into the arms of the police they will go. Is not\\nthat a beautiful and consoling thought? Yes, you may leave the room\\nnow. But be careful—be very careful. I——Ah, he is gone! And my\\nfriend Hastings looks at me with eyes of reproach. But it was all\\nso simple! It was clear, from the first, that out of several\\nhundred, probably, applicants for No. 4, Montagu Mansions only the\\nRobinsons were considered suitable. Why? What was there that\\nsingled them out from the rest—at practically a glance. Their\\nappearance? Possibly, but it was not so unusual. Their name, then!”\\n\\n“But there’s nothing unusual about the name of Robinson,” I cried.\\n“It’s quite a common name.”\\n\\n“Ah! _Sapristi_, but exactly! That was the point. Elsa Hardt and\\nher husband, or brother or whatever he really is, come from New\\nYork, and take a flat in the name of Mr. and Mrs. Robinson. Suddenly\\nthey learn that one of these secret societies, the Mafia, or the\\nCamorra, to which doubtless Luigi Valdarno belonged, is on their\\ntrack. What do they do? They hit on a scheme of transparent\\nsimplicity. Evidently they knew that their pursuers were not\\npersonally acquainted with either of them. What then can be simpler?\\nThey offer the flat at an absurdly low rental. Of the thousands of\\nyoung couples in London looking for flats, there cannot fail to be\\nseveral Robinsons. It is only a matter of waiting. If you will look\\nat the name of Robinson in the telephone directory, you will\\nrealize that a fair-haired Mrs. Robinson was pretty sure to come\\nalong sooner or later. Then what will happen? The avenger arrives.\\nHe knows the name, he knows the address. He strikes! All is over,\\nvengeance is satisfied, and Miss Elsa Hardt has escaped by the skin\\nof her teeth once more. By the way, Hastings, you must present me\\nto the real Mrs. Robinson—that delightful and truthful creature!\\nWhat will they think when they find their flat has been broken\\ninto! We must hurry back. Ah, that sounds like Japp and his friends\\narriving.”\\n\\nA mighty tattoo sounded on the knocker.\\n\\n“How did you know this address?” I asked as I followed Poirot out\\ninto the hall. “Oh, of course, you had the first Mrs. Robinson\\nfollowed when she left the other flat.”\\n\\n“_A la bonne heure_, Hastings. You use your grey cells at last.\\nNow for a little surprise for Japp.”\\n\\nSoftly unbolting the door, he stuck the cat’s head round the edge\\nand ejaculated a piercing “Miaow.”\\n\\nThe Scotland Yard inspector, who was standing outside with another\\nman, jumped in spite of himself.\\n\\n“Oh, it’s only Monsieur Poirot at one of his little jokes!” he\\nexclaimed, as Poirot’s head followed that of the cat. “Let us in,\\nmoosior.”\\n\\n“You have our friends safe and sound?”\\n\\n“Yes, we’ve got the birds all right. But they hadn’t got the goods\\nwith them.”\\n\\n“I see. So you come to search. Well, I am about to depart with\\nHastings, but I should like to give you a little lecture upon the\\nhistory and habits of the domestic cat.”\\n\\n“For the Lord’s sake, have you gone completely balmy?”\\n\\n“The cat,” declaimed Poirot, “was worshipped by the ancient\\nEgyptians. It is still regarded as a symbol of good luck if a black\\ncat crosses your path. This cat crossed your path to-night, Japp.\\nTo speak of the interior of any animal or any person is not, I\\nknow, considered polite in England. But the interior of this cat\\nis perfectly delicate. I refer to the lining.”\\n\\nWith a sudden grunt, the second man seized the cat from Poirot’s\\nhand.\\n\\n“Oh, I forgot to introduce you,” said Japp. “Mr. Poirot, this is\\nMr. Burt of the United States Secret Service.”\\n\\nThe American’s trained fingers had felt what he was looking for.\\nHe held out his hand, and for a moment speech failed him. Then he\\nrose to the occasion.\\n\\n“Pleased to meet you,” said Mr. Burt.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  IV\\n\\n\\n  The Mystery of Hunter’s Lodge\\n\\n\\n“After all,” murmured Poirot, “it is possible that I shall not die\\nthis time.”\\n\\nComing from a convalescent influenza patient, I hailed the remark\\nas showing a beneficial optimism. I myself had been the first\\nsufferer from the disease. Poirot in his turn had gone down. He\\nwas now sitting up in bed, propped up with pillows, his head\\nmuffled in a woollen shawl, and was slowly sipping a particularly\\nnoxious tisane which I had prepared according to his directions.\\nHis eye rested with pleasure upon a neatly graduated row of medicine\\nbottles which adorned the mantelpiece.\\n\\n“Yes, yes,” my little friend continued. “Once more shall I be\\nmyself again, the great Hercule Poirot, the terror of evil-doers!\\nFigure to yourself, _mon ami_, that I have a little paragraph to\\nmyself in _Society Gossip_. But yes! Here it is! ‘Go it—criminals—all\\nout! Hercule Poirot—and believe me, girls, he’s some Hercules!—our\\nown pet society detective can’t get a grip on you. ’Cause why?\\n’Cause he’s got _la grippe_ himself’!”\\n\\nI laughed.\\n\\n“Good for you, Poirot. You are becoming quite a public character.\\nAnd fortunately you haven’t missed anything of particular interest\\nduring this time.”\\n\\n“That is true. The few cases I have had to decline did not fill me\\nwith any regret.”\\n\\nOur landlady stuck her head in at the door.\\n\\n“There’s a gentleman downstairs. Says he must see Monsieur Poirot\\nor you, Captain. Seeing as he was in a great to-do—and with all\\nthat quite the gentleman—I brought up ’is card.”\\n\\nShe handed me the bit of pasteboard. “Mr. Roger Havering,” I read.\\n\\nPoirot motioned with his head towards the bookcase, and I obediently\\npulled forth “Who’s Who.” Poirot took it from me and scanned the\\npages rapidly.\\n\\n“Second son of fifth Baron Windsor. Married 1913 Zoe, fourth\\ndaughter of William Crabb.”\\n\\n“H’m!” I said. “I rather fancy that’s the girl who used to act at\\nthe Frivolity—only she called herself Zoe Carrisbrook. I remember\\nshe married some young man about town just before the War.”\\n\\n“Would it interest you, Hastings, to go down and hear what our\\nvisitor’s particular little trouble is? Make him all my excuses.”\\n\\nRoger Havering was a man of about forty, well set up and of smart\\nappearance. His face, however, was haggard, and he was evidently\\nlabouring under great agitation.\\n\\n“Captain Hastings? You are Monsieur Poirot’s partner, I understand.\\nIt is imperative that he should come with me to Derbyshire to-day.”\\n\\n“I’m afraid that’s impossible,” I replied. “Poirot is ill in\\nbed—influenza.”\\n\\nHis face fell.\\n\\n“Dear me, that is a great blow to me.”\\n\\n“The matter on which you want to consult him is serious?”\\n\\n“My God, yes! My uncle, the best friend I have in the world, was\\nfoully murdered last night.”\\n\\n“Here in London?”\\n\\n“No, in Derbyshire. I was in town and received a telegram from my\\nwife this morning. Immediately upon its receipt I determined to\\ncome round and beg Monsieur Poirot to undertake the case.”\\n\\n“If you will excuse me a minute,” I said, struck by a sudden idea.\\n\\nI rushed upstairs, and in a few brief words acquainted Poirot with\\nthe situation. He took any further words out of my mouth.\\n\\n“I see. I see. You want to go yourself, is it not so? Well, why\\nnot? You should know my methods by now. All I ask is that you\\nshould report to me fully every day, and follow implicitly any\\ninstructions I may wire you.”\\n\\nTo this I willingly agreed.\\n\\n\\n  •   •   •   •   •   •   •\\n\\n\\nAn hour later I was sitting opposite Mr. Havering in a first-class\\ncarriage on the Midland Railway, speeding rapidly away from London.\\n\\n“To begin with, Captain Hastings, you must understand that Hunter’s\\nLodge, where we are going, and where the tragedy took place, is\\nonly a small shooting-box in the heart of the Derbyshire moors.\\nOur real home is near Newmarket, and we usually rent a flat in town\\nfor the season. Hunter’s Lodge is looked after by a housekeeper\\nwho is quite capable of doing all we need when we run down for an\\noccasional week-end. Of course, during the shooting season, we take\\ndown some of our own servants from Newmarket. My uncle, Mr.\\nHarrington Pace (as you may know, my mother was a Miss Pace of New\\nYork), has, for the last three years, made his home with us. He\\nnever got on well with my father, or my elder brother, and I\\nsuspect that my being somewhat of a prodigal son myself rather\\nincreased than diminished his affection towards me. Of course I am\\na poor man, and my uncle was a rich one—in other words, he paid\\nthe piper! But, though exacting in many ways, he was not really\\nhard to get on with, and we all three lived very harmoniously\\ntogether. Two days ago my uncle, rather wearied with some recent\\ngaieties of ours in town, suggested that we should run down to\\nDerbyshire for a day or two. My wife telegraphed to Mrs. Middleton,\\nthe housekeeper, and we went down that same afternoon. Yesterday\\nevening I was forced to return to town, but my wife and my uncle\\nremained on. This morning I received this telegram.” He handed it\\nover to me:\\n\\n“Come at once uncle harrington murdered last night bring good\\ndetective if you can but do come—Zoe.”\\n\\n“Then, as yet you know no details?”\\n\\n“No, I suppose it will be in the evening papers. Without doubt the\\npolice are in charge.”\\n\\nIt was about three o’clock when we arrived at the little station\\nof Elmer’s Dale. From there a five-mile drive brought us to a small\\ngrey stone building in the midst of the rugged moors.\\n\\n“A lonely place,” I observed with a shiver.\\n\\nHavering nodded.\\n\\n“I shall try and get rid of it. I could never live here again.”\\n\\nWe unlatched the gate and were walking up the narrow path to the\\noak door when a familiar figure emerged and came to meet us.\\n\\n“Japp!” I ejaculated.\\n\\nThe Scotland Yard inspector grinned at me in a friendly fashion\\nbefore addressing my companion.\\n\\n“Mr. Havering, I think? I’ve been sent down from London to take\\ncharge of this case, and I’d like a word with you, if I may, sir.”\\n\\n“My wife——”\\n\\n“I’ve seen your good lady, sir—and the housekeeper. I won’t keep\\nyou a moment, but I’m anxious to get back to the village now that\\nI’ve seen all there is to see here.”\\n\\n“I know nothing as yet as to what——”\\n\\n“Ex-actly,” said Japp soothingly. “But there are just one or two\\nlittle points I’d like your opinion about all the same. Captain\\nHastings here, he knows me, and he’ll go on up to the house and\\ntell them you’re coming. What have you done with the little man,\\nby the way, Captain Hastings?”\\n\\n“He’s ill in bed with influenza.”\\n\\n“Is he now? I’m sorry to hear that. Rather the case of the cart\\nwithout the horse, your being here without him, isn’t it?”\\n\\nAnd on his rather ill-timed jest I went on to the house. I rang\\nthe bell, as Japp had closed the door behind him. After some\\nmoments it was opened to me by a middle-aged woman in black.\\n\\n“Mr. Havering will be here in a moment,” I explained. “He has been\\ndetained by the inspector. I have come down with him from London\\nto look into the case. Perhaps you can tell me briefly what occurred\\nlast night.”\\n\\n“Come inside, sir.” She closed the door behind me, and we stood in\\nthe dimly-lighted hall. “It was after dinner last night, sir, that\\nthe man came. He asked to see Mr. Pace, sir, and, seeing that he\\nspoke the same way, I thought it was an American gentleman friend\\nof Mr. Pace’s and I showed him into the gun-room, and then went to\\ntell Mr. Pace. He wouldn’t give any name, which, of course, was a\\nbit odd, now I come to think of it. I told Mr. Pace, and he seemed\\npuzzled like, but he said to the mistress: ‘Excuse me, Zoe, while\\nI just see what this fellow wants.’ He went off to the gun-room,\\nand I went back to the kitchen, but after a while I heard loud\\nvoices, as if they were quarrelling, and I came out into the hall.\\nAt the same time, the mistress she comes out too, and just then\\nthere was a shot and then a dreadful silence. We both ran to the\\ngun-room door, but it was locked and we had to go round to the\\nwindow. It was open, and there inside was Mr. Pace, all shot and\\nbleeding.”\\n\\n“What became of the man?”\\n\\n“He must have got away through the window, sir, before we got to\\nit.”\\n\\n“And then?”\\n\\n“Mrs. Havering sent me to fetch the police. Five miles to walk it\\nwas. They came back with me, and the constable he stayed all night,\\nand this morning the police gentleman from London arrived.”\\n\\n“What was this man like who called to see Mr. Pace?”\\n\\nThe housekeeper reflected.\\n\\n“He had a black beard, sir, and was about middle-aged, and had on\\na light overcoat. Beyond the fact that he spoke like an American\\nI didn’t notice much about him.”\\n\\n“I see. Now I wonder if I can see Mrs. Havering?”\\n\\n“She’s upstairs, sir. Shall I tell her?”\\n\\n“If you please. Tell her that Mr. Havering is outside with Inspector\\nJapp, and that the gentleman he has brought back with him from\\nLondon is anxious to speak to her as soon as possible.”\\n\\n“Very good, sir.”\\n\\nI was in a fever of impatience to get at all the facts. Japp had\\ntwo or three hours’ start of me, and his anxiety to be gone made\\nme keen to be close at his heels.\\n\\nMrs. Havering did not keep me waiting long. In a few minutes I\\nheard a light step descending the stairs, and looked up to see a\\nvery handsome young woman coming towards me. She wore a\\nflame-coloured jumper, that set off the slender boyishness of her\\nfigure. On her dark head was a little hat of flame-coloured leather.\\nEven the present tragedy could not dim the vitality of her\\npersonality.\\n\\nI introduced myself, and she nodded in quick comprehension.\\n\\n“Of course I have often heard of you and your colleague, Monsieur\\nPoirot. You have done some wonderful things together, haven’t you?\\nIt was very clever of my husband to get you so promptly. Now will\\nyou ask me questions? That is the easiest way, isn’t it, of getting\\nto know all you want to about this dreadful affair?”\\n\\n“Thank you, Mrs. Havering. Now what time was it that this man\\narrived?”\\n\\n“It must have been just before nine o’clock. We had finished\\ndinner, and were sitting over our coffee and cigarettes.”\\n\\n“Your husband had already left for London?”\\n\\n“Yes, he went up by the 6.15.”\\n\\n“Did he go by car to the station, or did he walk?”\\n\\n“Our own car isn’t down here. One came out from the garage in\\nElmer’s Dale to fetch him in time for the train.”\\n\\n“Was Mr. Pace quite his usual self?”\\n\\n“Absolutely. Most normal in every way.”\\n\\n“Now, can you describe this visitor at all?”\\n\\n“I’m afraid not. I didn’t see him. Mrs. Middleton showed him\\nstraight into the gun-room and then came to tell my uncle.”\\n\\n“What did your uncle say?”\\n\\n“He seemed rather annoyed, but went off at once. It was about five\\nminutes later that I heard the sound of raised voices. I ran out\\ninto the hall and almost collided with Mrs. Middleton. Then we\\nheard the shot. The gun-room door was locked on the inside, and we\\nhad to go right round the house to the window. Of course that took\\nsome time, and the murderer had been able to get well away. My poor\\nuncle”—her voice faltered—“had been shot through the head. I saw\\nat once that he was dead. I sent Mrs. Middleton for the police. I\\nwas careful to touch nothing in the room but to leave it exactly\\nas I found it.”\\n\\nI nodded approval.\\n\\n“Now, as to the weapon?”\\n\\n“Well, I can make a guess at it, Captain Hastings. A pair of\\nrevolvers of my husband’s were mounted upon the wall. One of them\\nis missing. I pointed this out to the police, and they took the\\nother one away with them. When they have extracted the bullet, I\\nsuppose they will know for certain.”\\n\\n“May I go to the gun-room?”\\n\\n“Certainly. The police have finished with it. But the body has been\\nremoved.”\\n\\nShe accompanied me to the scene of the crime. At that moment Havering\\nentered the hall, and with a quick apology his wife ran to him. I\\nwas left to undertake my investigations alone.\\n\\nI may as well confess at once that they were rather disappointing.\\nIn detective novels clues abound, but here I could find nothing\\nthat struck me as out of the ordinary except a large bloodstain on\\nthe carpet where I judged the dead man had fallen. I examined\\neverything with painstaking care and took a couple of pictures of\\nthe room with my little camera which I had brought with me. I also\\nexamined the ground outside the window, but it appeared to have\\nbeen so heavily trampled underfoot that I judged it was useless to\\nwaste time over it. No, I had seen all that Hunter’s Lodge had to\\nshow me. I must go back to Elmer’s Dale and get into touch with\\nJapp. Accordingly I took leave of the Haverings, and was driven\\noff in the car that had brought us up from the station.\\n\\nI found Japp at the Matlock Arms and he took me forthwith to see\\nthe body. Harrington Pace was a small, spare clean-shaven man,\\ntypically American in appearance. He had been shot through the back\\nof the head, and the revolver had been discharged at close quarters.\\n\\n“Turned away for a moment,” remarked Japp, “and the other fellow\\nsnatched up a revolver and shot him. The one Mrs. Havering handed\\nover to us was fully loaded and I suppose the other one was also.\\nCurious what darn fool things people do. Fancy keeping two loaded\\nrevolvers hanging up on your wall.”\\n\\n“What do you think of the case?” I asked, as we left the gruesome\\nchamber behind us.\\n\\n“Well, I’d got my eye on Havering to begin with. Oh, yes!” noting\\nmy exclamation of astonishment. “Havering has one or two shady\\nincidents in his past. When he was a boy at Oxford there was some\\nfunny business about the signature on one of his father’s cheques.\\nAll hushed up of course. Then, he’s pretty heavily in debt now,\\nand they’re the kind of debts he wouldn’t like to go to his uncle\\nabout, whereas you may be sure the uncle’s will would be in his\\nfavour. Yes, I’d got my eye on him, and that’s why I wanted to\\nspeak to him before he saw his wife, but their statements dovetail\\nall right, and I’ve been to the station and there’s no doubt\\nwhatever that he left by the 6.15. That gets up to London about\\n10.30. He went straight to his club, he says, and if that’s\\nconfirmed all right—why, he couldn’t have been shooting his uncle\\nhere at nine o’clock in a black beard!”\\n\\n“Ah, yes, I was going to ask you what you thought about that\\nbeard?”\\n\\nJapp winked.\\n\\n“I think it grew pretty fast—grew in the five miles from Elmer’s\\nDale to Hunter’s Lodge. Americans that I’ve met are mostly\\nclean-shaven. Yes, it’s amongst Mr. Pace’s American associates that\\nwe’ll have to look for the murderer. I questioned the housekeeper\\nfirst, and then her mistress, and their stories agree all right,\\nbut I’m sorry Mrs. Havering didn’t get a look at the fellow. She’s\\na smart woman, and she might have noticed something that would set\\nus on the track.”\\n\\nI sat down and wrote a minute and lengthy account to Poirot. I was\\nable to add various further items of information before I posted\\nthe letter.\\n\\nThe bullet had been extracted and was proved to have been fired\\nfrom a revolver identical with the one held by the police.\\nFurthermore, Mr. Havering’s movements on the night in question had\\nbeen checked and verified, and it was proved beyond doubt that he\\nhad actually arrived in London by the train in question. And,\\nthirdly, a sensational development had occurred. A city gentleman,\\nliving at Ealing, on crossing Haven Green to get to the District\\nRailway Station that morning, had observed a brown-paper parcel\\nstuck between the railings. Opening it, he found that it contained\\na revolver. He handed the parcel over to the local police station,\\nand before night it was proved to be the one we were in search of,\\nthe fellow to that given us by Mrs. Havering. One bullet had been\\nfired from it.\\n\\nAll this I added to my report. A wire from Poirot arrived whilst\\nI was at breakfast the following morning:\\n\\n“Of course black bearded man was not Havering only you or Japp\\nwould have such an idea wire me description of housekeeper and what\\nclothes she wore this morning same of Mrs. Havering do not waste\\ntime taking photographs of interiors they are underexposed and not\\nin the least artistic.”\\n\\nIt seemed to me that Poirot’s style was unnecessarily facetious.\\nI also fancied he was a shade jealous of my position on the spot\\nwith full facilities for handling the case. His request for a\\ndescription of the clothes worn by the two women appeared to me to\\nbe simply ridiculous, but I complied as well as I, a mere man, was\\nable to.\\n\\nAt eleven a reply wire came from Poirot:\\n\\n“Advise Japp arrest housekeeper before it is too late.”\\n\\nDumbfounded, I took the wire to Japp. He swore softly under his\\nbreath.\\n\\n“He’s the goods, Monsieur Poirot! If he says so, there’s something\\nin it. And I hardly noticed the woman. I don’t know that I can go\\nso far as arresting her, but I’ll have her watched. We’ll go up\\nright away, and take another look at her.”\\n\\nBut it was too late. Mrs. Middleton, that quiet middle-aged woman,\\nwho had appeared so normal and respectable, had vanished into thin\\nair. Her box had been left behind. It contained only ordinary\\nwearing apparel. There was no clue in it to her identity, or as to\\nher whereabouts.\\n\\nFrom Mrs. Havering we elicited all the facts we could:\\n\\n“I engaged her about three weeks ago when Mrs. Emery, our former\\nhousekeeper, left. She came to me from Mrs. Selbourne’s Agency in\\nMount Street—a very well-known place. I get all my servants from\\nthere. They sent several women to see me, but this Mrs. Middleton\\nseemed much the nicest, and had splendid references. I engaged her\\non the spot, and notified the Agency of the fact. I can’t believe\\nthat there was anything wrong with her. She was such a nice quiet\\nwoman.”\\n\\nThe thing was certainly a mystery. Whilst it was clear that the\\nwoman herself could not have committed the crime, since at the\\nmoment the shot was fired Mrs. Havering was with her in the hall,\\nnevertheless she must have some connection with the murder, or why\\nshould she suddenly take to her heels and bolt?\\n\\nI wired the latest development to Poirot and suggested returning\\nto London and making inquiries at Selbourne’s Agency.\\n\\nPoirot’s reply was prompt:\\n\\n“Useless to inquire at agency they will never have heard of her\\nfind out what vehicle took her up to hunters lodge when she first\\narrived there.”\\n\\nThough mystified, I was obedient. The means of transport in Elmer’s\\nDale were limited. The local garage had two battered Ford cars,\\nand there were two station flies. None of these had been\\nrequisitioned on the date in question. Questioned, Mrs. Havering\\nexplained that she had given the woman the money for her fare down\\nto Derbyshire and sufficient to hire a car or fly to take her up\\nto Hunter’s Lodge. There was usually one of the Fords at the\\nstation on the chance of its being required. Taking into\\nconsideration the further fact that nobody at the station had\\nnoticed the arrival of a stranger, black-bearded or otherwise, on\\nthe fatal evening, everything seemed to point to the conclusion\\nthat the murderer had come to the spot in a car, which had been\\nwaiting near at hand to aid his escape, and that the same car had\\nbrought the mysterious housekeeper to her new post. I may mention\\nthat inquiries at the Agency in London bore out Poirot’s\\nprognostication. No such woman as “Mrs. Middleton” had ever been\\non their books. They had received the Hon. Mrs. Havering’s\\napplication for a housekeeper, and had sent her various applicants\\nfor the post. When she sent them the engagement fee, she omitted\\nto mention which woman she had selected.\\n\\nSomewhat crestfallen, I returned to London. I found Poirot\\nestablished in an arm-chair by the fire in a garish, silk\\ndressing-gown. He greeted me with much affection.\\n\\n“_Mon ami_ Hastings! But how glad I am to see you. Veritably I have\\nfor you a great affection. And you have enjoyed yourself? You have\\nrun to and fro with the good Japp? You have interrogated and\\ninvestigated to your heart’s content?”\\n\\n“Poirot,” I cried, “the thing’s a dark mystery! It will never be\\nsolved.”\\n\\n“It is true that we are not likely to cover ourselves with glory\\nover it.”\\n\\n“No, indeed. It’s a hard nut to crack.”\\n\\n“Oh, as far as that goes, I am very good at cracking the nuts! A\\nveritable squirrel! It is not that which embarrasses me. I know\\nwell enough who killed Mr. Harrington Pace.”\\n\\n“You know? How did you find out?”\\n\\n“Your illuminating answers to my wires supplied me with the truth.\\nSee here, Hastings, let us examine the facts methodically and in\\norder. Mr. Harrington Pace is a man with a considerable fortune\\nwhich at his death will doubtless pass to his nephew. Point No. 1.\\nHis nephew is known to be desperately hard up. Point No. 2. His\\nnephew is also known to be—shall we say a man of rather loose\\nmoral fibre? Point No. 3.”\\n\\n“But Roger Havering is proved to have journeyed straight up to\\nLondon.”\\n\\n“_Précisément_—and therefore, as Mr. Havering left Elmer’s Dale at\\n6.15, and since Mr. Pace cannot have been killed before he left,\\nor the doctor would have spotted the time of the crime as being\\ngiven wrongly when he examined the body, we conclude quite rightly,\\nthat Mr. Havering did not shoot his uncle. But there is a Mrs.\\nHavering, Hastings.”\\n\\n“Impossible! The housekeeper was with her when the shot was fired.”\\n\\n“Ah, yes, the housekeeper. But she has disappeared.”\\n\\n“She will be found.”\\n\\n“I think not. There is something peculiarly elusive about that\\nhousekeeper, don’t you think so, Hastings? It struck me at once.”\\n\\n“She played her part, I suppose, and then got out in the nick of\\ntime.”\\n\\n“And what was her part?”\\n\\n“Well, presumably to admit her confederate, the black-bearded man.”\\n\\n“Oh, no, that was not her part! Her part was what you have just\\nmentioned, to provide an alibi for Mrs. Havering at the moment the\\nshot was fired. And no one will ever find her, _mon ami_, because\\nshe does not exist! ‘There’s no sech person,’ as your so great\\nShakespeare says.”\\n\\n“It was Dickens,” I murmured, unable to suppress a smile. “But what\\ndo you mean, Poirot?”\\n\\n“I mean that Zoe Havering was an actress before her marriage, that\\nyou and Japp only saw the housekeeper in a dark hall, a dim\\nmiddle-aged figure in black with a faint subdued voice, and finally\\nthat neither you nor Japp, nor the local police whom the housekeeper\\nfetched, ever saw Mrs. Middleton and her mistress at one and the\\nsame time. It was child’s play for that clever and daring woman.\\nOn the pretext of summoning her mistress, she runs upstairs, slips\\non a bright jumper and a hat with black curls attached which she\\njams down over the grey transformation. A few deft touches, and\\nthe make-up is removed, a slight dusting of rouge, and the brilliant\\nZoe Havering comes down with her clear ringing voice. Nobody looks\\nparticularly at the housekeeper. Why should they? There is nothing\\nto connect her with the crime. She, too, has an alibi.”\\n\\n“But the revolver that was found at Ealing? Mrs. Havering could\\nnot have placed it there?”\\n\\n“No, that was Roger Havering’s job—but it was a mistake on their\\npart. It put me on the right track. A man who has committed a\\nmurder with a revolver which he found on the spot would fling it\\naway at once, he would not carry it up to London with him. No, the\\nmotive was clear, the criminals wished to focus the interest of\\nthe police on a spot far removed from Derbyshire they were anxious\\nto get the police away as soon as possible from the vicinity of\\nHunter’s Lodge. Of course the revolver found at Ealing was not the\\none with which Mr. Pace was shot. Roger Havering discharged one\\nshot from it, brought it up to London, went straight to his club\\nto establish his alibi, then went quickly out to Ealing by the\\ndistrict, a matter of about twenty minutes only, placed the parcel\\nwhere it was found and so back to town. That charming creature,\\nhis wife, quietly shoots Mr. Pace after dinner—you remember he was\\nshot from behind? Another significant point, that!—reloads the\\nrevolver and puts it back in its place, and then starts off with\\nher desperate little comedy.”\\n\\n“It’s incredible,” I murmured, fascinated, “and yet——”\\n\\n“And yet it is true. _Bien sur_, my friend, it is true. But to\\nbring that precious pair to justice, that is another matter. Well,\\nJapp must do what he can—I have written him fully—but I very much\\nfear, Hastings, that we shall be obliged to leave them to Fate, or\\n_le bon Dieu_, whichever you prefer.”\\n\\n“The wicked flourish like a green bay tree,” I reminded him.\\n\\n“But at a price, Hastings, always at a price, _croyez-moi!_”\\n\\nPoirot’s forebodings were confirmed. Japp, though convinced of the\\ntruth of his theory, was unable to get together the necessary\\nevidence to ensure a conviction.\\n\\nMr. Pace’s huge fortune passed into the hands of his murderers.\\nNevertheless, Nemesis did overtake them, and when I read in the\\npaper that the Hon. Roger and Mrs. Havering were amongst those\\nkilled in the crashing of the Air Mail to Paris I knew that Justice\\nwas satisfied.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  V\\n\\n  The Million Dollar Bond Robbery\\n\\n“What a number of bond robberies there have been lately!” I observed\\none morning, laying aside the newspaper. “Poirot, let us forsake\\nthe science of detection, and take to crime instead!”\\n\\n“You are on the—how do you say it?—get-rich-quick tack, eh, _mon\\nami_?”\\n\\n“Well, look at this last _coup_, the million dollars’ worth of\\nLiberty Bonds which the London and Scottish Bank were sending to\\nNew York, and which disappeared in such a remarkable manner on\\nboard the _Olympia_.”\\n\\n“If it were not for the _mal de mer_, and the difficulty of\\npractising the so excellent method of Laverguier for a longer time\\nthan the few hours of crossing the channel, I should delight to\\nvoyage myself on one of these big liners,” murmured Poirot dreamily.\\n\\n“Yes, indeed,” I said enthusiastically. “Some of them must be\\nperfect palaces; the swimming-baths, the lounges, the restaurant,\\nthe palm courts—really, it must be hard to believe that one is on\\nthe sea.”\\n\\n“Me, I always know when I am on the sea,” said Poirot sadly. “And\\nall those bagatelles that you enumerate, they say nothing to me;\\nbut, my friend, consider for a moment the geniuses that travel as\\nit were incognito! On board these floating palaces, as you so\\njustly call them, one would meet the élite, the _haute noblesse_\\nof the criminal world!”\\n\\nI laughed.\\n\\n“So that’s the way your enthusiasm runs! You would have liked to\\ncross swords with the man who sneaked the Liberty Bonds?”\\n\\nThe landlady interrupted us.\\n\\n“A young lady as wants to see you, Mr. Poirot. Here’s her card.”\\n\\nThe card bore the inscription: Miss Esmée Farquhar, and Poirot,\\nafter diving under the table to retrieve a stray crumb, and putting\\nit carefully in the waste-paper-basket, nodded to the landlady to\\nadmit her.\\n\\nIn another minute one of the most charming girls I have ever seen\\nwas ushered into the room. She was perhaps about five-and-twenty,\\nwith big brown eyes and a perfect figure. She was well-dressed and\\nperfectly composed in manner.\\n\\n“Sit down, I beg of you, mademoiselle. This is my friend, Captain\\nHastings, who aids me in my little problems.”\\n\\n“I am afraid it is a big problem I have brought you to-day, Monsieur\\nPoirot,” said the girl, giving me a pleasant bow as she seated\\nherself. “I dare say you have read about it in the papers. I am\\nreferring to the theft of Liberty Bonds on the _Olympia_.” Some\\nastonishment must have shown itself in Poirot’s face, for she\\ncontinued quickly: “You are doubtless asking yourself what I have\\nto do with a grave institution like the London and Scottish Bank.\\nIn one sense nothing, in another sense everything. You see, Monsieur\\nPoirot, I am engaged to Mr. Philip Ridgeway.”\\n\\n“Aha! and Mr. Philip Ridgeway——”\\n\\n“Was in charge of the bonds when they were stolen. Of course no\\nactual blame can attach to him, it was not his fault in any way.\\nNevertheless, he is half distraught over the matter, and his uncle,\\nI know, insists that he must carelessly have mentioned having them\\nin his possession. It is a terrible set-back in his career.”\\n\\n“Who is his uncle?”\\n\\n“Mr. Vavasour, joint general manager of the London and Scottish\\nBank.”\\n\\n“Suppose, Miss Farquhar, that you recount to me the whole story?”\\n\\n“Very well. As you know, the Bank wished to extend their credits\\nin America, and for this purpose decided to send over a million\\ndollars in Liberty Bonds. Mr. Vavasour selected his nephew, who\\nhad occupied a position of trust in the Bank for many years and\\nwho was conversant with all the details of the Bank’s dealings in\\nNew York, to make the trip. The Olympia sailed from Liverpool on\\nthe 23rd, and the bonds were handed over to Philip on the morning\\nof that day by Mr. Vavasour and Mr. Shaw, the two joint general\\nmanagers of the London and Scottish Bank. They were counted,\\nenclosed in a package, and sealed in his presence, and he then\\nlocked the package at once in his portmanteau.”\\n\\n“A portmanteau with an ordinary lock?”\\n\\n“No, Mr. Shaw insisted on a special lock being fitted to it by\\nHubbs’s. Philip, as I say, placed the package at the bottom of the\\ntrunk. It was stolen just a few hours before reaching New York. A\\nrigorous search of the whole ship was made, but without result.\\nThe bonds seemed literally to have vanished into thin air.”\\n\\nPoirot made a grimace.\\n\\n“But they did not vanish absolutely, since I gather that they were\\nsold in small parcels within half an hour of the docking of the\\n_Olympia_! Well, undoubtedly the next thing is for me to see Mr.\\nRidgeway.”\\n\\n“I was about to suggest that you should lunch with me at the\\n‘Cheshire Cheese.’ Philip will be there. He is meeting me, but does\\nnot yet know that I have been consulting you on his behalf.”\\n\\nWe agreed to this suggestion readily enough, and drove there in a\\ntaxi.\\n\\nMr. Philip Ridgeway was there before us, and looked somewhat\\nsurprised to see his fiancée arriving with two complete strangers.\\nHe was a nice-looking young fellow, tall and spruce, with a touch\\nof greying hair at the temples, though he could not have been much\\nover thirty.\\n\\nMiss Farquhar went up to him and laid her hand on his arm.\\n\\n“You must forgive my acting without consulting you, Philip,” she\\nsaid. “Let me introduce you to Monsieur Hercule Poirot, of whom\\nyou must often have heard, and his friend, Captain Hastings.”\\n\\nRidgeway looked very astonished.\\n\\n“Of course I have heard of you, Monsieur Poirot,” he said, as he\\nshook hands. “But I had no idea that Esmée was thinking of\\nconsulting you about my—our trouble.”\\n\\n“I was afraid you would not let me do it, Philip,” said Miss\\nFarquhar meekly.\\n\\n“So you took care to be on the safe side,” he observed, with a\\nsmile. “I hope Monsieur Poirot will be able to throw some light on\\nthis extraordinary puzzle, for I confess frankly that I am nearly\\nout of my mind with worry and anxiety about it.”\\n\\nIndeed, his face looked drawn and haggard and showed only too\\nclearly the strain under which he was labouring.\\n\\n“Well, well,” said Poirot. “Let us lunch, and over lunch we will\\nput our heads together and see what can be done. I want to hear\\nMr. Ridgeway’s story from his own lips.”\\n\\nWhilst we discussed the excellent steak and kidney pudding of the\\nestablishment, Philip Ridgeway narrated the circumstances leading\\nto the disappearance of the bonds. His story agreed with that of\\nMiss Farquhar in every particular. When he had finished, Poirot\\ntook up the thread with a question.\\n\\n“What exactly led you to discover that the bonds had been stolen,\\nMr. Ridgeway?”\\n\\nHe laughed rather bitterly.\\n\\n“The thing stared me in the face, Monsieur Poirot. I couldn’t have\\nmissed it. My cabin trunk was half out from under the bunk and all\\nscratched and cut about where they’d tried to force the lock.”\\n\\n“But I understood that it had been opened with a key?”\\n\\n“That’s so. They tried to force it, but couldn’t. And, in the end,\\nthey must have got it unlocked somehow or other.”\\n\\n“Curious,” said Poirot, his eyes beginning to flicker with the\\ngreen light I knew so well. “Very curious! They waste much, much\\ntime trying to prise it open, and then—_sapristi!_ they find that\\nthey have the key all the time—for each of Hubbs’s locks are\\nunique.”\\n\\n“That’s just why they couldn’t have had the key. It never left me\\nday or night.”\\n\\n“You are sure of that?”\\n\\n“I can swear to it, and besides, if they had had the key or a\\nduplicate, why should they waste time trying to force an obviously\\nunforceable lock?”\\n\\n“Ah! there is exactly the question we are asking ourselves! I\\nventure to prophesy that the solution, if we ever find it, will\\nhinge on that curious fact. I beg of you not to assault me if I\\nask you one more question: _Are you perfectly certain you did not\\nleave the trunk unlocked?_”\\n\\nPhilip Ridgeway merely looked at him, and Poirot gesticulated\\napologetically.\\n\\n“Ah, but these things can happen, I assure you! Very well, the\\nbonds were stolen from the trunk. What did the thief do with them?\\nHow did he manage to get ashore with them?”\\n\\n“Ah!” cried Ridgeway. “That’s just it. How? Word was passed to the\\nCustoms authorities, and every soul that left the ship was gone\\nover with a toothcomb!”\\n\\n“And the bonds, I gather, made a bulky package?”\\n\\n“Certainly they did. They could hardly have been hidden on board—and\\nanyway we know they weren’t because they were offered for sale\\nwithin half an hour of the _Olympia’s_ arrival, long before I got\\nthe cables going and the numbers sent out. One broker swears he\\nbought some of them even before the _Olympia_ got in. But you can’t\\nsend bonds by wireless.”\\n\\n“Not by wireless, but did any tug come alongside?”\\n\\n“Only the official ones, and that was after the alarm was given\\nwhen every one was on the look-out. I was watching out myself for\\ntheir being passed over to some one that way. My God, Monsieur\\nPoirot, this thing will drive me mad! People are beginning to say\\nI stole them myself.”\\n\\n“But you also were searched on landing, weren’t you?” asked Poirot\\ngently.\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\nThe young man stared at him in a puzzled manner.\\n\\n“You do not catch my meaning, I see,” said Poirot, smiling\\nenigmatically. “Now I should like to make a few inquiries at the\\nBank.”\\n\\nRidgeway produced a card and scribbled a few words on it.\\n\\n“Send this in and my uncle will see you at once.”\\n\\nPoirot thanked him, bade farewell to Miss Farquhar, and together\\nwe started out for Threadneedle Street and the head office of the\\nLondon and Scottish Bank. On production of Ridgeway’s card, we were\\nled through the labyrinth of counters and desks, skirting paying-in\\nclerks and paying-out clerks and up to a small office on the first\\nfloor where the joint general managers received us. They were two\\ngrave gentlemen, who had grown grey in the service of the Bank.\\nMr. Vavasour had a short white beard, Mr. Shaw was clean shaven.\\n\\n“I understand you are strictly a private inquiry agent?” said Mr.\\nVavasour. “Quite so, quite so. We have, of course, placed ourselves\\nin the hands of Scotland Yard. Inspector McNeil has charge of the\\ncase. A very able officer, I believe.”\\n\\n“I am sure of it,” said Poirot politely. “You will permit a few\\nquestions, on your nephew’s behalf? About this lock, who ordered\\nit from Hubbs’s?”\\n\\n“I ordered it myself,” said Mr. Shaw. “I would not trust to any\\nclerk in the matter. As to the keys, Mr. Ridgeway had one, and the\\nother two are held by my colleague and myself.”\\n\\n“And no clerk has had access to them?”\\n\\nMr. Shaw turned inquiringly to Mr. Vavasour. “I think I am correct\\nin saying that they have remained in the safe where we placed them\\non the 23rd,” said Mr. Vavasour. “My colleague was unfortunately\\ntaken ill a fortnight ago—in fact on the very day that Philip left\\nus. He has only just recovered.”\\n\\n“Severe bronchitis is no joke to a man of my age,” said Mr. Shaw\\nruefully. “But I am afraid Mr. Vavasour has suffered from the hard\\nwork entailed by my absence, especially with this unexpected worry\\ncoming on top of everything.”\\n\\nPoirot asked a few more questions. I judged that he was endeavouring\\nto gauge the exact amount of intimacy between uncle and nephew.\\nMr. Vavasour’s answers were brief and punctilious. His nephew was\\na trusted official of the Bank, and had no debts or money\\ndifficulties that he knew of. He had been entrusted with similar\\nmissions in the past. Finally we were politely bowed out.\\n\\n“I am disappointed,” said Poirot, as we emerged into the street.\\n\\n“You hoped to discover more? They are such stodgy old men.”\\n\\n“It is not their stodginess which disappoints me, _mon ami_. I do\\nnot expect to find in a Bank manager a ‘keen financier with an\\neagle glance’ as your favourite works of fiction put it. No, I am\\ndisappointed in the case—it is too easy!”\\n\\n“Easy?”\\n\\n“Yes, do you not find it almost childishly simple?”\\n\\n“You know who stole the bonds?”\\n\\n“I do.”\\n\\n“But then—we must—why——”\\n\\n“Do not confuse and fluster yourself, Hastings. We are not going\\nto do anything at present.”\\n\\n“But why? What are you waiting for?”\\n\\n“For the _Olympia_. She is due on her return trip from New York on\\nTuesday.”\\n\\n“But if you know who stole the bonds, why wait? He may escape.”\\n\\n“To a South Sea island where there is no extradition? No, _mon\\nami_, he would find life very uncongenial there. As to why I\\nwait—_eh bien_ to the intelligence of Hercule Poirot the case is\\nperfectly clear, but for the benefit of others, not so greatly\\ngifted by the good God—the Inspector McNeil, for instance—it would\\nbe as well to make a few inquiries to establish the facts. One must\\nhave consideration for those less gifted than oneself.”\\n\\n“Good Lord, Poirot! Do you know, I’d give a considerable sum of\\nmoney to see you make a thorough ass of yourself—just for once.\\nYou’re so confoundedly conceited!”\\n\\n“Do not enrage yourself, Hastings. In verity, I observe that there\\nare times when you almost detest me! Alas, I suffer the penalties\\nof greatness!”\\n\\nThe little man puffed out his chest, and sighed so comically that\\nI was forced to laugh.\\n\\nTuesday saw us speeding to Liverpool in a first-class carriage of\\nthe L. & N.W.R. Poirot had obstinately refused to enlighten me as\\nto his suspicions—or certainties. He contented himself with\\nexpressing surprise that I, too, was not equally _au fait_ with\\nthe situation. I disdained to argue, and entrenched my curiosity\\nbehind a rampart of pretended indifference.\\n\\nOnce arrived at the quay alongside which lay the big transatlantic\\nliner, Poirot became brisk and alert. Our proceedings consisted in\\ninterviewing four successive stewards and inquiring after a friend\\nof Poirot’s who had crossed to New York on the 23rd.\\n\\n“An elderly gentleman, wearing glasses. A great invalid, hardly\\nmoved out of his cabin.”\\n\\nThe description appeared to tally with one Mr. Ventnor who had\\noccupied the cabin C 24 which was next to that of Philip Ridgeway.\\nAlthough unable to see how Poirot had deduced Mr. Ventnor’s\\nexistence and personal appearance, I was keenly excited.\\n\\n“Tell me,” I cried, “was this gentleman one of the first to land\\nwhen you got to New York?” The steward shook his head.\\n\\n“No, indeed, sir, he was one of the last off the boat.”\\n\\nI retired crestfallen, and observed Poirot grinning at me. He\\nthanked the steward, a note changed hands, and we took our\\ndeparture.\\n\\n“It’s all very well,” I remarked heatedly, “but that last answer\\nmust have damped your precious theory, grin as you please!”\\n\\n“As usual, you see nothing, Hastings. That last answer is, on the\\ncontrary, the coping-stone of my theory.”\\n\\nI flung up my hands in despair.\\n\\n“I give it up.”\\n\\n\\n  •   •   •   •   •   •   •\\n\\n\\nWhen we were in the train, speeding towards London, Poirot wrote\\nbusily for a few minutes, sealing up the result in an envelope.\\n\\n“This is for the good Inspector McNeil. We will leave it at Scotland\\nYard in passing, and then to the Rendezvous Restaurant, where I\\nhave asked Miss Esmée Farquhar to do us the honour of dining with\\nus.”\\n\\n“What about Ridgeway?”\\n\\n“What about him?” asked Poirot with a twinkle.\\n\\n“Why, you surely don’t think—you can’t——”\\n\\n“The habit of incoherence is growing upon you, Hastings. As a\\nmatter of fact I _did_ think. If Ridgeway had been the thief—which\\nwas perfectly possible—the case would have been charming; a piece\\nof neat methodical work.”\\n\\n“But not so charming for Miss Farquhar.”\\n\\n“Possibly you are right. Therefore all is for the best. Now,\\nHastings, let us review the case. I can see that you are dying to\\ndo so. The sealed package is removed from the trunk and vanishes,\\nas Miss Farquhar puts it, into thin air. We will dismiss the thin\\nair theory, which is not practicable at the present stage of\\nscience, and consider what is likely to have become of it. Every\\none asserts the incredibility of its being smuggled ashore——”\\n\\n“Yes, but we know——”\\n\\n“_You_ may know, Hastings. I do not. I take the view that, since\\nit seemed incredible, it _was_ incredible. Two possibilities\\nremain: it was hidden on board—also rather difficult—or it was\\nthrown overboard.”\\n\\n“With a cork on it, do you mean?”\\n\\n“Without a cork.”\\n\\nI stared.\\n\\n“But if the bonds were thrown overboard, they couldn’t have been\\nsold in New York.”\\n\\n“I admire your logical mind, Hastings. The bonds were sold in New\\nYork, therefore they were not thrown overboard. You see where that\\nleads us?”\\n\\n“Where we were when we started.”\\n\\n“_Jamais de la vie!_ If the package was thrown overboard, and the\\nbonds were sold in New York, the package could not have contained\\nthe bonds. Is there any evidence that the package _did_ contain\\nthe bonds? Remember, Mr. Ridgeway never opened it from the time it\\nwas placed in his hands in London.”\\n\\n“Yes, but then——”\\n\\nPoirot waved an impatient hand.\\n\\n“Permit me to continue. The last moment that the bonds are seen as\\nbonds is in the office of the London and Scottish Bank on the\\nmorning of the 23rd. They reappear in New York half an hour after\\nthe _Olympia_ gets in, and according to one man, whom nobody\\nlistens to, actually _before_ she gets in. Supposing then, that\\nthey have never been on the _Olympia_ at all? Is there any other\\nway they could get to New York? Yes. The _Gigantic_ leaves\\nSouthampton on the same day as the _Olympia_, and she holds the\\nrecord for the Atlantic. Mailed by the _Gigantic_, the bonds would\\nbe in New York the day before the _Olympia_ arrived. All is clear,\\nthe case begins to explain itself. The sealed packet is only a\\ndummy, and the moment of its substitution must be in the office in\\nthe Bank. It would be an easy matter for any of the three men\\npresent to have prepared a duplicate package which could be\\nsubstituted for the genuine one. _Très bien_, the bonds are mailed\\nto a confederate in New York, with instructions to sell as soon as\\nthe _Olympia_ is in, but some one must travel on the _Olympia_ to\\nengineer the supposed moment of the robbery.”\\n\\n“But why?”\\n\\n“Because if Ridgeway merely opens the packet and finds it a dummy,\\nsuspicion flies at once to London. No, the man on board in the\\ncabin next door does his work, pretends to force the lock in an\\nobvious manner so as to draw immediate attention to the theft,\\nreally unlocks the trunk with a duplicate key, throws the package\\noverboard and waits until the last to leave the boat. Naturally he\\nwears glasses to conceal his eyes, and is an invalid since he does\\nnot want to run the risk of meeting Ridgeway. He steps ashore in\\nNew York and returns by the first boat available.”\\n\\n“But who—which was he?”\\n\\n“The man who had a duplicate key, the man who ordered the lock,\\nthe man who has _not_ been severely ill with bronchitis at his home\\nin the country—_enfin_, that ‘stodgy’ old man, Mr. Shaw! There are\\ncriminals in high places sometimes, my friend. Ah, here we are.\\nMademoiselle, I have succeeded! You permit?”\\n\\nAnd, beaming, Poirot kissed the astonished girl lightly on either\\ncheek!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  VI\\n\\n\\n  The Adventure of the Egyptian Tomb\\n\\n\\nI have always considered that one of the most thrilling and dramatic\\nof the many adventures I have shared with Poirot was that of our\\ninvestigation into the strange series of deaths which followed upon\\nthe discovery and opening of the Tomb of King Men-her-Ra.\\n\\nHard upon the discovery of the Tomb of Tut-ankh-Amen by Lord\\nCarnarvon, Sir John Willard and Mr. Bleibner of New York, pursuing\\ntheir excavations not far from Cairo, in the vicinity of the\\nPyramids of Gizeh, came unexpectedly on a series of funeral\\nchambers. The greatest interest was aroused by their discovery.\\nThe Tomb appeared to be that of King Men-her-Ra, one of those\\nshadowy kings of the Eighth Dynasty, when the Old Kingdom was\\nfalling to decay. Little was known about this period, and the\\ndiscoveries were fully reported in the newspapers.\\n\\nAn event soon occurred which took a profound hold on the public\\nmind. Sir John Willard died quite suddenly of heart failure.\\n\\nThe more sensational newspapers immediately took the opportunity\\nof reviving all the old superstitious stories connected with the\\nill luck of certain Egyptian treasures. The unlucky Mummy at the\\nBritish Museum, that hoary old chestnut, was dragged out with fresh\\nzest, was quietly denied by the Museum, but nevertheless enjoyed\\nall its usual vogue.\\n\\nA fortnight later Mr. Bleibner died of acute blood poisoning, and\\na few days afterwards a nephew of his shot himself in New York.\\nThe “Curse of Men-her-Ra” was the talk of the day, and the magic\\npower of dead and gone Egypt was exalted to a fetish point.\\n\\nIt was then that Poirot received a brief note from Lady Willard,\\nwidow of the dead archaeologist, asking him to go and see her at\\nher house in Kensington Square. I accompanied him.\\n\\nLady Willard was a tall, thin woman, dressed in deep mourning. Her\\nhaggard face bore eloquent testimony to her recent grief.\\n\\n“It is kind of you to have come so promptly, Monsieur Poirot.”\\n\\n“I am at your service, Lady Willard. You wished to consult me?”\\n\\n“You are, I am aware, a detective, but it is not only as a detective\\nthat I wish to consult you. You are a man of original views, I\\nknow, you have imagination, experience of the world, tell me,\\nMonsieur Poirot, what are your views on the supernatural?”\\n\\nPoirot hesitated for a moment before he replied. He seemed to be\\nconsidering. Finally he said:\\n\\n“Let us not misunderstand each other, Lady Willard. It is not a\\ngeneral question that you are asking me there. It has a personal\\napplication, has it not? You are referring obliquely to the death\\nof your late husband?”\\n\\n“That is so,” she admitted.\\n\\n“You want me to investigate the circumstances of his death?”\\n\\n“I want you to ascertain for me exactly how much is newspaper\\nchatter, and how much may be said to be founded on fact? Three\\ndeaths, Monsieur Poirot—each one explicable taken by itself, but\\ntaken together surely an almost unbelievable coincidence, and all\\nwithin a month of the opening of the tomb! It may be mere\\nsuperstition, it may be some potent curse from the past that\\noperates in ways undreamed of by modern science. The fact\\nremains—three deaths! And I am afraid, Monsieur Poirot, horribly\\nafraid. It may not yet be the end.”\\n\\n“For whom do you fear?”\\n\\n“For my son. When the news of my husband’s death came I was ill.\\nMy son, who has just come down from Oxford, went out there. He\\nbrought the—the body home, but now he has gone out again, in spite\\nof my prayers and entreaties. He is so fascinated by the work that\\nhe intends to take his father’s place and carry on the system of\\nexcavations. You may think me a foolish, credulous woman, but,\\nMonsieur Poirot, I am afraid. Supposing that the spirit of the dead\\nKing is not yet appeased? Perhaps to you I seem to be talking\\nnonsense——”\\n\\n“No, indeed, Lady Willard,” said Poirot quickly. “I, too, believe\\nin the force of superstition, one of the greatest forces the world\\nhas ever known.”\\n\\nI looked at him in surprise. I should never have credited Poirot\\nwith being superstitious. But the little man was obviously in\\nearnest.\\n\\n“What you really demand is that I shall protect your son? I will\\ndo my utmost to keep him from harm.”\\n\\n“Yes, in the ordinary way, but against an occult influence?”\\n\\n“In volumes of the Middle Ages, Lady Willard, you will find many\\nways of counteracting black magic. Perhaps they knew more than we\\nmoderns with all our boasted science. Now let us come to facts,\\nthat I may have guidance. Your husband had always been a devoted\\nEgyptologist, hadn’t he?”\\n\\n“Yes, from his youth upwards. He was one of the greatest living\\nauthorities upon the subject.”\\n\\n“But Mr. Bleibner, I understand, was more or less of an amateur?”\\n\\n“Oh, quite. He was a very wealthy man who dabbled freely in any\\nsubject that happened to take his fancy. My husband managed to\\ninterest him in Egyptology, and it was his money that was so useful\\nin financing the expedition.”\\n\\n“And the nephew? What do you know of his tastes? Was he with the\\nparty at all?”\\n\\n“I do not think so. In fact I never knew of his existence till I\\nread of his death in the paper, I do not think he and Mr. Bleibner\\ncan have been at all intimate. He never spoke of having any\\nrelations.”\\n\\n“Who are the other members of the party?”\\n\\n“Well, there is Dr. Tosswill, a minor official connected with the\\nBritish Museum; Mr. Schneider of the Metropolitan Museum in New\\nYork; a young American secretary; Dr. Ames, who accompanies the\\nexpedition in his professional capacity; and Hassan, my husband’s\\ndevoted native servant.”\\n\\n“Do you remember the name of the American secretary?”\\n\\n“Harper, I think, but I cannot be sure. He had not been with Mr.\\nBleibner very long, I know. He was a very pleasant young fellow.”\\n\\n“Thank you, Lady Willard.”\\n\\n“If there is anything else——?”\\n\\n“For the moment, nothing. Leave it now in my hands, and be assured\\nthat I will do all that is humanly possible to protect your son.”\\n\\nThey were not exactly reassuring words, and I observed Lady Willard\\nwince as he uttered them. Yet, at the same time, the fact that he\\nhad not pooh-poohed her fears seemed in itself to be a relief to\\nher.\\n\\nFor my part I had never before suspected that Poirot had so deep\\na vein of superstition in his nature. I tackled him on the subject\\nas we went homewards. His manner was grave and earnest.\\n\\n“But yes, Hastings. I believe in these things. You must not\\nunderrate the force of superstition.”\\n\\n“What are we going to do about it?”\\n\\n“_Toujours pratique_, the good Hastings! _Eh bien_, to begin with\\nwe are going to cable to New York for fuller details of young Mr.\\nBleibner’s death.”\\n\\nHe duly sent off his cable. The reply was full and precise. Young\\nRupert Bleibner had been in low water for several years. He had\\nbeen a beach-comber and a remittance man in several South Sea\\nislands, but had returned to New York two years ago, where he had\\nrapidly sunk lower and lower. The most significant thing, to my\\nmind, was that he had recently managed to borrow enough money to\\ntake him to Egypt. “I’ve a good friend there I can borrow from,”\\nhe had declared. Here, however, his plans had gone awry. He had\\nreturned to New York cursing his skinflint of an uncle who cared\\nmore for the bones of dead and gone kings than his own flesh and\\nblood. It was during his sojourn in Egypt that the death of Sir\\nJohn Willard occurred. Rupert had plunged once more into his life\\nof dissipation in New York, and then, without warning, he had\\ncommitted suicide, leaving behind him a letter which contained some\\ncurious phrases. It seemed written in a sudden fit of remorse. He\\nreferred to himself as a leper and an outcast, and the letter ended\\nby declaring that such as he were better dead.\\n\\nA shadowy theory leapt into my brain. I had never really believed\\nin the vengeance of a long dead Egyptian king. I saw here a more\\nmodern crime. Supposing this young man had decided to do away with\\nhis uncle—preferably by poison. By mistake, Sir John Willard\\nreceives the fatal dose. The young man returns to New York, haunted\\nby his crime. The news of his uncle’s death reaches him. He realizes\\nhow unnecessary his crime has been, and stricken with remorse takes\\nhis own life.\\n\\nI outlined my solution to Poirot. He was interested.\\n\\n“It is ingenious what you have thought of there—decidedly it is\\ningenious. It may even be true. But you leave out of count the\\nfatal influence of the Tomb.”\\n\\nI shrugged my shoulders.\\n\\n“You still think that has something to do with it?”\\n\\n“So much so, _mon ami_, that we start for Egypt to-morrow.”\\n\\n“What?” I cried, astonished.\\n\\n“I have said it.” An expression of conscious heroism spread over\\nPoirot’s face. Then he groaned. “But, oh,” he lamented, “the sea!\\nThe hateful sea!”\\n\\n\\n  •   •   •   •   •   •   •\\n\\n\\nIt was a week later. Beneath our feet was the golden sand of the\\ndesert. The hot sun poured down overhead. Poirot, the picture of\\nmisery, wilted by my side. The little man was not a good traveller.\\nOur four days’ voyage from Marseilles had been one long agony to\\nhim. He had landed at Alexandria the wraith of his former self,\\neven his usual neatness had deserted him. We had arrived in Cairo\\nand had driven out at once to the Mena House Hotel, right in the\\nshadow of the Pyramids.\\n\\nThe charm of Egypt had laid hold of me. Not so Poirot. Dressed\\nprecisely the same as in London, he carried a small clothes-brush\\nin his pocket and waged an unceasing war on the dust which\\naccumulated on his dark apparel.\\n\\n“And my boots,” he wailed. “Regard them, Hastings. My boots, of\\nthe neat patent leather, usually so smart and shining. See, the\\nsand is inside them, which is painful, and outside them, which\\noutrages the eyesight. Also the heat, it causes my moustaches to\\nbecome limp—but limp!”\\n\\n“Look at the Sphinx,” I urged. “Even I can feel the mystery and\\nthe charm it exhales.”\\n\\nPoirot looked at it discontentedly.\\n\\n“It has not the air happy,” he declared. “How could it, half-buried\\nin sand in that untidy fashion. Ah, this cursed sand!”\\n\\n“Come, now, there’s a lot of sand in Belgium,” I reminded him,\\nmindful of a holiday spent at Knocke-sur-mer in the midst of “_les\\ndunes impeccables_” as the guide-book had phrased it.\\n\\n“Not in Brussels,” declared Poirot. He gazed at the Pyramids\\nthoughtfully. “It is true that they, at least, are of a shape solid\\nand geometrical, but their surface is of an unevenness most\\nunpleasing. And the palm-trees I like them not. Not even do they\\nplant them in rows!”\\n\\nI cut short his lamentations, by suggesting that we should start\\nfor the camp. We were to ride there on camels, and the beasts were\\npatiently kneeling, waiting for us to mount, in charge of several\\npicturesque boys headed by a voluble dragoman.\\n\\nI pass over the spectacle of Poirot on a camel. He started by\\ngroans and lamentations and ended by shrieks, gesticulations and\\ninvocations to the Virgin Mary and every Saint in the calendar. In\\nthe end, he descended ignominiously and finished the journey on a\\ndiminutive donkey. I must admit that a trotting camel is no joke\\nfor the amateur. I was stiff for several days.\\n\\nAt last we neared the scene of the excavations. A sunburnt man with\\na grey beard, in white clothes and wearing a helmet, came to meet\\nus.\\n\\n“Monsieur Poirot and Captain Hastings? We received your cable. I’m\\nsorry that there was no one to meet you in Cairo. An unforeseen\\nevent occurred which completely disorganized our plans.”\\n\\nPoirot paled. His hand, which had stolen to his clothes-brush,\\nstayed its course.\\n\\n“Not another death?” he breathed.\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“Sir Guy Willard?” I cried.\\n\\n“No, Captain Hastings. My American colleague, Mr. Schneider.”\\n\\n“And the cause?” demanded Poirot.\\n\\n“Tetanus.”\\n\\nI blanched. All around me I seemed to feel an atmosphere of evil,\\nsubtle and menacing. A horrible thought flashed across me. Supposing\\nI were the next?\\n\\n“_Mon Dieu_,” said Poirot, in a very low voice, “I do not understand\\nthis. It is horrible. Tell me, monsieur, there is no doubt that it\\nwas tetanus?”\\n\\n“I believe not. But Dr. Ames will tell you more than I can do.”\\n\\n“Ah, of course, you are not the doctor.”\\n\\n“My name is Tosswill.”\\n\\nThis, then, was the British expert described by Lady Willard as\\nbeing a minor official at the British Museum. There was something\\nat once grave and steadfast about him that took my fancy.\\n\\n“If you will come with me,” continued Dr. Tosswill, “I will take\\nyou to Sir Guy Willard. He was most anxious to be informed as soon\\nas you should arrive.”\\n\\nWe were taken across the camp to a large tent. Dr. Tosswill lifted\\nup the flap and we entered. Three men were sitting inside.\\n\\n“Monsieur Poirot and Captain Hastings have arrived, Sir Guy,” said\\nTosswill.\\n\\nThe youngest of the three men jumped up and came forward to greet\\nus. There was a certain impulsiveness in his manner which reminded\\nme of his mother. He was not nearly so sunburnt as the others, and\\nthat fact, coupled with a certain haggardness round the eyes, made\\nhim look older than his twenty-two years. He was clearly endeavouring\\nto bear up under a severe mental strain.\\n\\nHe introduced his two companions, Dr. Ames, a capable looking man\\nof thirty odd, with a touch of greying hair at the temples, and\\nMr. Harper, the secretary, a pleasant lean young man wearing the\\nnational insignia of horn-rimmed spectacles.\\n\\nAfter a few minutes’ desultory conversation the latter went out,\\nand Dr. Tosswill followed him. We were left alone with Sir Guy and\\nDr. Ames.\\n\\n“Please ask any questions you want to ask, Monsieur Poirot,” said\\nWillard. “We are utterly dumbfounded at this strange series of\\ndisasters, but it isn’t—it can’t be, anything but coincidence.”\\n\\nThere was a nervousness about his manner which rather belied the\\nwords. I saw that Poirot was studying him keenly.\\n\\n“Your heart is really in this work, Sir Guy?”\\n\\n“Rather. No matter what happens, or what comes of it, the work is\\ngoing on. Make up your mind to that.”\\n\\nPoirot wheeled round on the other.\\n\\n“What have you to say to that, _monsieur le docteur_?”\\n\\n“Well,” drawled the doctor, “I’m not for quitting myself.”\\n\\nPoirot made one of those expressive grimaces of his.\\n\\n“Then, _évidemment_, we must find out just how we stand. When did\\nMr. Schneider’s death take place?”\\n\\n“Three days ago.”\\n\\n“You are sure it was tetanus?”\\n\\n“Dead sure.”\\n\\n“It couldn’t have been a case of strychnine poisoning, for\\ninstance?”\\n\\n“No, Monsieur Poirot. I see what you’re getting at. But it was a\\nclear case of tetanus.”\\n\\n“Did you not inject anti-serum?”\\n\\n“Certainly we did,” said the doctor dryly. “Every conceivable thing\\nthat could be done was tried.”\\n\\n“Had you the anti-serum with you?”\\n\\n“No. We procured it from Cairo.”\\n\\n“Have there been any other cases of tetanus in the camp?”\\n\\n“No, not one.”\\n\\n“Are you certain that the death of Mr. Bleibner was not due to\\ntetanus?”\\n\\n“Absolutely plumb certain. He had a scratch upon his thumb which\\nbecame poisoned, and septicæmia set in. It sounds pretty much the\\nsame to a layman, I dare say, but the two things are entirely\\ndifferent.”\\n\\n“Then we have four deaths—all totally dissimilar, one heart failure,\\none blood poisoning, one suicide and one tetanus.”\\n\\n“Exactly, Monsieur Poirot.”\\n\\n“Are you certain that there is nothing which might link the four\\ntogether?”\\n\\n“I don’t quite understand you?”\\n\\n“I will put it plainly. Was any act committed by those four men\\nwhich might seem to denote disrespect to the spirit of Men-her-Ra?”\\n\\nThe doctor gazed at Poirot in astonishment.\\n\\n“You’re talking through your hat, Monsieur Poirot. Surely you’ve\\nnot been guyed into believing all that fool talk?”\\n\\n“Absolute nonsense,” muttered Willard angrily.\\n\\nPoirot remained placidly immovable, blinking a little out of his\\ngreen cat’s eyes.\\n\\n“So you do not believe it, _monsieur le docteur_?”\\n\\n“No, sir, I do not,” declared the doctor emphatically. “I am a\\nscientific man, and I believe only what science teaches.”\\n\\n“Was there no science then in Ancient Egypt?” asked Poirot softly.\\nHe did not wait for a reply, and indeed Dr. Ames seemed rather at\\na loss for the moment. “No, no, do not answer me, but tell me this.\\nWhat do the native workmen think?”\\n\\n“I guess,” said Dr. Ames, “that, where white folk lose their heads,\\nnatives aren’t going to be far behind. I’ll admit that they’re\\ngetting what you might call scared—but they’ve no cause to be.”\\n\\n“I wonder,” said Poirot non-committally.\\n\\nSir Guy leant forward.\\n\\n“Surely,” he cried incredulously, “you cannot believe in—oh, but\\nthe thing’s absurd! You can know nothing of Ancient Egypt if you\\nthink that.”\\n\\nFor answer Poirot produced a little book from his pocket—an ancient\\ntattered volume. As he held it out I saw its title, _The Magic of\\nthe Egyptians and Chaldeans_. Then, wheeling round, he strode out\\nof the tent. The doctor stared at me.\\n\\n“What is his little idea?”\\n\\nThe phrase, so familiar on Poirot’s lips, made me smile as it came\\nfrom another.\\n\\n“I don’t know exactly,” I confessed. “He’s got some plan of\\nexorcizing the evil spirits, I believe.”\\n\\nI went in search of Poirot, and found him talking to the lean-faced\\nyoung man who had been the late Mr. Bleibner’s secretary.\\n\\n“No,” Mr. Harper was saying, “I’ve only been six months with the\\nexpedition. Yes, I knew Mr. Bleibner’s affairs pretty well.”\\n\\n“Can you recount to me anything concerning his nephew?”\\n\\n“He turned up here one day, not a bad-looking fellow. I’d never\\nmet him before, but some of the others had—Ames, I think, and\\nSchneider. The old man wasn’t at all pleased to see him. They were\\nat it in no time, hammer and tongs. ‘Not a cent,’ the old man\\nshouted. ‘Not one cent now or when I’m dead. I intend to leave my\\nmoney to the furtherance of my life’s work. I’ve been talking it\\nover with Mr. Schneider to-day.’ And a bit more of the same. Young\\nBleibner lit out for Cairo right away.”\\n\\n“Was he in perfectly good health at the time?”\\n\\n“The old man?”\\n\\n“No, the young one.”\\n\\n“I believe he did mention there was something wrong with him. But\\nit couldn’t have been anything serious, or I should have remembered.”\\n\\n“One thing more, has Mr. Bleibner left a will?”\\n\\n“So far as we know, he has not.”\\n\\n“Are you remaining with the expedition, Mr. Harper?”\\n\\n“No, sir, I am not. I’m for New York as soon as I can square up\\nthings here. You may laugh if you like, but I’m not going to be\\nthis blasted old Men-her-Ra’s next victim. He’ll get me if I stop\\nhere.”\\n\\nThe young man wiped the perspiration from his brow.\\n\\nPoirot turned away. Over his shoulder he said with a peculiar\\nsmile:\\n\\n“Remember, he got one of his victims in New York.”\\n\\n“Oh, hell!” said Mr. Harper forcibly.\\n\\n“That young man is nervous,” said Poirot thoughtfully. “He is on\\nthe edge, but absolutely on the edge.”\\n\\nI glanced at Poirot curiously, but his enigmatical smile told me\\nnothing. In company with Sir Guy Willard and Dr. Tosswill we were\\ntaken round the excavations. The principal finds had been removed\\nto Cairo, but some of the tomb furniture was extremely interesting.\\nThe enthusiasm of the young baronet was obvious, but I fancied that\\nI detected a shade of nervousness in his manner as though he could\\nnot quite escape from the feeling of menace in the air. As we\\nentered the tent which had been assigned to us, for a wash before\\njoining the evening meal, a tall dark figure in white robes stood\\naside to let us pass with a graceful gesture and a murmured greeting\\nin Arabic. Poirot stopped.\\n\\n“You are Hassan, the late Sir John Willard’s servant?”\\n\\n“I served my Lord Sir John, now I serve his son.” He took a step\\nnearer to us and lowered his voice. “You are a wise one, they say,\\nlearned in dealing with evil spirits. Let the young master depart\\nfrom here. There is evil in the air around us.”\\n\\nAnd with an abrupt gesture, not waiting for a reply, he strode\\naway.\\n\\n“Evil in the air,” muttered Poirot. “Yes, I feel it.”\\n\\nOur meal was hardly a cheerful one. The floor was left to Dr.\\nTosswill, who discoursed at length upon Egyptian antiquities. Just\\nas we were preparing to retire to rest, Sir Guy caught Poirot by\\nthe arm and pointed. A shadowy figure was moving amidst the tents.\\nIt was no human one: I recognized distinctly the dog-headed figure\\nI had seen carved on the walls of the tomb.\\n\\nMy blood literally froze at the sight.\\n\\n“_Mon Dieu!_” murmured Poirot, crossing himself vigorously. “Anubis,\\nthe jackal-headed, the god of departing souls.”\\n\\n“Some one is hoaxing us,” cried Dr. Tosswill, rising indignantly\\nto his feet.\\n\\n“It went into your tent, Harper,” muttered Sir Guy, his face\\ndreadfully pale.\\n\\n“No,” said Poirot, shaking his head, “into that of the Dr. Ames.”\\n\\nThe doctor stared at him incredulously; then, repeating Dr.\\nTosswill’s words, he cried:\\n\\n“Some one is hoaxing us. Come, we’ll soon catch the fellow.”\\n\\nHe dashed energetically in pursuit of the shadowy apparition. I\\nfollowed him, but, search as we would, we could find no trace of\\nany living soul having passed that way. We returned, somewhat\\ndisturbed in mind, to find Poirot taking energetic measures, in\\nhis own way, to ensure his personal safety. He was busily\\nsurrounding our tent with various diagrams and inscriptions which\\nhe was drawing in the sand. I recognized the five-pointed star or\\nPentagon many times repeated. As was his wont, Poirot was at the\\nsame time delivering an impromptu lecture on witchcraft and magic\\nin general, White Magic as opposed to Black, with various references\\nto the Ka and the Book of the Dead thrown in.\\n\\nIt appeared to excite the liveliest contempt in Dr. Tosswill, who\\ndrew me aside, literally snorting with rage.\\n\\n“Balderdash, sir,” he exclaimed angrily. “Pure balderdash. The\\nman’s an impostor. He doesn’t know the difference between the\\nsuperstitions of the Middle Ages and the beliefs of Ancient Egypt.\\nNever have I heard such a hotch-potch of ignorance and credulity.”\\n\\nI calmed the excited expert, and joined Poirot in the tent. My\\nlittle friend was beaming cheerfully.\\n\\n“We can now sleep in peace,” he declared happily. “And I can do\\nwith some sleep. My head, it aches abominably. Ah, for a good\\n_tisane_!”\\n\\nAs though in answer to prayer, the flap of the tent was lifted and\\nHassan appeared, bearing a steaming cup which he offered to Poirot.\\nIt proved to be camomile tea, a beverage of which he is inordinately\\nfond. Having thanked Hassan and refused his offer of another cup\\nfor myself, we were left alone once more. I stood at the door of\\nthe tent some time after undressing, looking out over the desert.\\n\\n“A wonderful place,” I said aloud, “and a wonderful work. I can\\nfeel the fascination. This desert life, this probing into the heart\\nof a vanished civilization. Surely, Poirot, you, too, must feel\\nthe charm?”\\n\\nI got no answer, and I turned, a little annoyed. My annoyance was\\nquickly changed to concern. Poirot was lying back across the rude\\ncouch, his face horribly convulsed. Beside him was the empty cup.\\nI rushed to his side, then dashed out and across the camp to Dr.\\nAmes’s tent.\\n\\n“Dr. Ames!” I cried. “Come at once.”\\n\\n“What’s the matter?” said the doctor, appearing in pyjamas.\\n\\n“My friend. He’s ill. Dying. The camomile tea. Don’t let Hassan\\nleave the camp.”\\n\\nLike a flash the doctor ran to our tent. Poirot was lying as I left\\nhim.\\n\\n“Extraordinary,” cried Ames. “Looks like a seizure—or—what did you\\nsay about something he drank?” He picked up the empty cup.\\n\\n“Only I did not drink it!” said a placid voice.\\n\\nWe turned in amazement. Poirot was sitting up on the bed. He was\\nsmiling.\\n\\n“No,” he said gently. “I did not drink it. While my good friend\\nHastings was apostrophizing the night, I took the opportunity of\\npouring it, not down my throat, but into a little bottle. That\\nlittle bottle will go to the analytical chemist. No”—as the doctor\\nmade a sudden movement—“as a sensible man, you will understand that\\nviolence will be of no avail. During Hastings’ brief absence to\\nfetch you, I have had time to put the bottle in safe keeping. Ah,\\nquick, Hastings, hold him!”\\n\\nI misunderstood Poirot’s anxiety. Eager to save my friend, I flung\\nmyself in front of him. But the doctor’s swift movement had another\\nmeaning. His hand went to his mouth, a smell of bitter almonds\\nfilled the air, and he swayed forward and fell.\\n\\n“Another victim,” said Poirot gravely, “but the last. Perhaps it\\nis the best way. He has three deaths on his head.”\\n\\n“Dr. Ames?” I cried, stupefied. “But I thought you believed in some\\noccult influence?”\\n\\n“You misunderstood me, Hastings. What I meant was that I believe\\nin the terrific force of superstition. Once get it firmly\\nestablished that a series of deaths are supernatural, and you might\\nalmost stab a man in broad daylight, and it would still be put down\\nto the curse, so strongly is the instinct of the supernatural\\nimplanted in the human race. I suspected from the first that a man\\nwas taking advantage of that instinct. The idea came to him, I\\nimagine, with the death of Sir John Willard. A fury of superstition\\narose at once. As far as I could see, nobody could derive any\\nparticular profit from Sir John’s death. Mr. Bleibner was a\\ndifferent case. He was a man of great wealth. The information I\\nreceived from New York contained several suggestive points. To\\nbegin with, young Bleibner was reported to have said he had a good\\nfriend in Egypt from whom he could borrow. It was tacitly understood\\nthat he meant his uncle, but it seemed to me that in that case he\\nwould have said so outright. The words suggest some boon companion\\nof his own. Another thing, he scraped up enough money to take him\\nto Egypt, his uncle refused outright to advance him a penny, yet\\nhe was able to pay the return passage to New York. Some one must\\nhave lent him the money.”\\n\\n“All that was very thin,” I objected.\\n\\n“But there was more. Hastings, there occur often enough words\\nspoken metaphorically which are taken literally. The opposite can\\nhappen too. In this case, words which were meant literally were\\ntaken metaphorically. Young Bleibner wrote plainly enough: ‘I am\\na leper,’ but nobody realized that he shot himself because he\\nbelieved that he had contracted the dread disease of leprosy.”\\n\\n“What?” I ejaculated.\\n\\n“It was the clever invention of a diabolical mind. Young Bleibner\\nwas suffering from some minor skin trouble, he had lived in the\\nSouth Sea Islands, where the disease is common enough. Ames was a\\nformer friend of his, and a well-known medical man, he would never\\ndream of doubting his word. When I arrived here, my suspicions were\\ndivided between Harper and Dr. Ames, but I soon realized that only\\nthe doctor could have perpetrated and concealed the crimes, and I\\nlearnt from Harper that he was previously acquainted with young\\nBleibner. Doubtless the latter at some time or another had made a\\nwill or had insured his life in favour of the doctor. The latter\\nsaw his chance of acquiring wealth. It was easy for him to inoculate\\nMr. Bleibner with the deadly germs. Then the nephew, overcome with\\ndespair at the dread news his friend had conveyed to him, shot\\nhimself. Mr. Bleibner, whatever his intentions, had made no will.\\nHis fortune would pass to his nephew and from him to the doctor.”\\n\\n“And Mr. Schneider?”\\n\\n“We cannot be sure. He knew young Bleibner too, remember, and may\\nhave suspected something, or, again, the doctor may have thought\\nthat a further death motiveless and purposeless would strengthen\\nthe coils of superstition. Furthermore, I will tell you an\\ninteresting psychological fact, Hastings. A murderer has always a\\nstrong desire to repeat his successful crime, the performance of\\nit grows upon him. Hence my fears for young Willard. The figure of\\nAnubis you saw to-night was Hassan, dressed up by my orders. I\\nwanted to see if I could frighten the doctor. But it would take\\nmore than the supernatural to frighten him. I could see that he\\nwas not entirely taken in by my pretences of belief in the occult.\\nThe little comedy I played for him did not deceive him. I suspected\\nthat he would endeavour to make me the next victim. Ah, but in\\nspite of _la mer maudite_, the heat abominable, and the annoyances\\nof the sand, the little grey cells still functioned!”\\n\\nPoirot proved to be perfectly right in his premises. Young Bleibner,\\nsome years ago, in a fit of drunken merriment, had made a jocular\\nwill, leaving “my cigarette case you admire so much and everything\\nelse of which I die possessed which will be principally debts to\\nmy good friend Robert Ames who once saved my life from drowning.”\\n\\nThe case was hushed up as far as possible, and, to this day, people\\ntalk of the remarkable series of deaths in connection with the Tomb\\nof Men-her-Ra as a triumphal proof of the vengeance of a bygone\\nking upon the desecrators of his tomb—a belief which, as Poirot\\npointed out to me, is contrary to all Egyptian belief and thought.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  VII\\n\\n  The Jewel Robbery at the _Grand Metropolitan_\\n\\n“Poirot,” I said, “a change of air would do you good.”\\n\\n“You think so, _mon ami_?”\\n\\n“I am sure of it.”\\n\\n“Eh—eh?” said my friend, smiling. “It is all arranged, then?”\\n\\n“You will come?”\\n\\n“Where do you propose to take me?”\\n\\n“Brighton. As a matter of fact, a friend of mine in the City put\\nme on to a very good thing, and—well, I have money to burn, as the\\nsaying goes. I think a week-end at the _Grand Metropolitan_ would\\ndo us all the good in the world.”\\n\\n“Thank you, I accept most gratefully. You have the good heart to\\nthink of an old man. And the good heart, it is in the end worth\\nall the little grey cells. Yes, yes, I who speak to you am in\\ndanger of forgetting that sometimes.”\\n\\nI did not quite relish the implication. I fancy that Poirot is\\nsometimes a little inclined to underestimate my mental capacities.\\nBut his pleasure was so evident that I put my slight annoyance\\naside.\\n\\n“Then, that’s all right,” I said hastily.\\n\\nSaturday evening saw us dining at the _Grand Metropolitan_ in the\\nmidst of a gay throng. All the world and his wife seemed to be at\\nBrighton. The dresses were marvellous, and the jewels—worn sometimes\\nwith more love of display than good taste—were something magnificent.\\n\\n“_Hein_, it is a sight this!” murmured Poirot. “This is the home\\nof the Profiteer, is it not so, Hastings?”\\n\\n“Supposed to be,” I replied. “But we’ll hope they aren’t all tarred\\nwith the Profiteering brush.”\\n\\nPoirot gazed round him placidly.\\n\\n“The sight of so many jewels makes me wish I had turned my brains\\nto crime, instead of to its detection. What a magnificent\\nopportunity for some thief of distinction! Regard, Hastings, that\\nstout woman by the pillar. She is, as you would say, plastered with\\ngems.”\\n\\nI followed his eyes.\\n\\n“Why,” I exclaimed, “it’s Mrs. Opalsen.”\\n\\n“You know her?”\\n\\n“Slightly. Her husband is a rich stockbroker who made a fortune in\\nthe recent Oil boom.”\\n\\nAfter dinner we ran across the Opalsens in the lounge, and I\\nintroduced Poirot to them. We chatted for a few minutes, and ended\\nby having our coffee together.\\n\\nPoirot said a few words in praise of some of the costlier gems\\ndisplayed on the lady’s ample bosom, and she brightened up at once.\\n\\n“It’s a perfect hobby of mine, Mr. Poirot. I just _love_ jewellery.\\nEd knows my weakness, and every time things go well he brings me\\nsomething new. You are interested in precious stones?”\\n\\n“I have had a good deal to do with them one time and another,\\nmadame. My profession has brought me into contact with some of the\\nmost famous jewels in the world.”\\n\\nHe went on to narrate, with discreet pseudonyms, the story of the\\nhistoric jewels of a reigning house, and Mrs. Opalsen listened with\\nbated breath.\\n\\n“There now!” she exclaimed, as he ended. “If it isn’t just like a\\nplay! You know, I’ve got some pearls of my own that have a history\\nattached to them. I believe it’s supposed to be one of the finest\\nnecklaces in the world—the pearls are so beautifully matched and\\nso perfect in colour. I declare I really must run up and get it!”\\n\\n“Oh, madame,” protested Poirot, “you are too amiable. Pray do not\\nderange yourself!”\\n\\n“Oh, but I’d like to show it to you.”\\n\\nThe buxom dame waddled across to the lift briskly enough. Her\\nhusband, who had been talking to me, looked at Poirot inquiringly.\\n\\n“Madame your wife is so amiable as to insist on showing me her\\npearl necklace,” explained the latter.\\n\\n“Oh, the pearls!” Opalsen smiled in a satisfied fashion. “Well,\\nthey _are_ worth seeing. Cost a pretty penny too! Still, the\\nmoney’s there all right; I could get what I paid for them any\\nday—perhaps more. May have to, too, if things go on as they are\\nnow. Money’s confoundedly tight in the City. All this infernal\\nE.P.D.” He rambled on, launching into technicalities where I could\\nnot follow him.\\n\\nHe was interrupted by a small page-boy who approached and murmured\\nsomething in his ear.\\n\\n“Eh—what? I’ll come at once. Not taken ill, is she? Excuse me,\\ngentlemen.”\\n\\nHe left us abruptly. Poirot leaned back and lit one of his tiny\\nRussian cigarettes. Then, carefully and meticulously, he arranged\\nthe empty coffee-cups in a neat row, and beamed happily on the\\nresult.\\n\\nThe minutes passed. The Opalsens did not return.\\n\\n“Curious,” I remarked, at length. “I wonder when they will come\\nback.”\\n\\nPoirot watched the ascending spirals of smoke, and then said\\nthoughtfully:\\n\\n“They will not come back.”\\n\\n“Why?”\\n\\n“Because, my friend, something has happened.”\\n\\n“What sort of thing? How do you know?” I asked curiously.\\n\\nPoirot smiled.\\n\\n“A few moments ago the manager came hurriedly out of his office\\nand ran upstairs. He was much agitated. The lift-boy is deep in\\ntalk with one of the pages. The lift-bell has rung three times,\\nbut he heeds it not. Thirdly, even the waiters are _distrait_; and\\nto make a waiter _distrait_——” Poirot shook his head with an air\\nof finality. “The affair must indeed be of the first magnitude.\\nAh, it is as I thought! Here come the police.”\\n\\nTwo men had just entered the hotel—one in uniform, the other in\\nplain clothes. They spoke to a page, and were immediately ushered\\nupstairs. A few minutes later, the same boy descended and came up\\nto where we were sitting.\\n\\n“Mr. Opalsen’s compliments, and would you step upstairs.”\\n\\nPoirot sprang nimbly to his feet. One would have said that he\\nawaited the summons. I followed with no less alacrity.\\n\\nThe Opalsens’ apartments were situated on the first floor. After\\nknocking on the door, the page-boy retired, and we answered the\\nsummons, “Come in!” A strange scene met our eyes. The room was Mrs.\\nOpalsen’s bedroom, and in the centre of it, lying back in an\\narm-chair, was the lady herself, weeping violently. She presented\\nan extraordinary spectacle, with the tears making great furrows in\\nthe powder with which her complexion was liberally coated. Mr.\\nOpalsen was striding up and down angrily. The two police officials\\nstood in the middle of the room, one with a notebook in hand. An\\nhotel chambermaid, looking frightened to death, stood by the\\nfire-place; and on the other side of the room a Frenchwoman,\\nobviously Mrs. Opalsen’s maid, was weeping and wringing her hands,\\nwith an intensity of grief that rivalled that of her mistress.\\n\\nInto this pandemonium stepped Poirot, neat and smiling. Immediately,\\nwith an energy surprising in one of her bulk, Mrs. Opalsen sprang\\nfrom her chair towards him.\\n\\n“There now; Ed may say what he likes, but I believe in luck, I do.\\nIt was fated I should meet you the way I did this evening, and I’ve\\na feeling that if you can’t get my pearls back for me nobody can.”\\n\\n“Calm yourself, I pray of you, madame.” Poirot patted her hand\\nsoothingly. “Reassure yourself. All will be well. Hercule Poirot\\nwill aid you!”\\n\\nMr. Opalsen turned to the police inspector.\\n\\n“There will be no objection to my—er—calling in this gentleman, I\\nsuppose?”\\n\\n“None at all, sir,” replied the man civilly, but with complete\\nindifference. “Perhaps now your lady’s feeling better she’ll just\\nlet us have the facts?”\\n\\nMrs. Opalsen looked helplessly at Poirot. He led her back to her\\nchair.\\n\\n“Seat yourself, madame, and recount to us the whole history without\\nagitating yourself.”\\n\\nThus abjured, Mrs. Opalsen dried her eyes gingerly, and began.\\n\\n“I came upstairs after dinner to fetch my pearls for Mr. Poirot\\nhere to see. The chambermaid and Célestine were both in the room\\nas usual——”\\n\\n“Excuse me, madame, but what do you mean by ‘as usual’?”\\n\\nMr. Opalsen explained.\\n\\n“I make it a rule that no one is to come into this room unless\\nCélestine, the maid, is there also. The chambermaid does the room\\nin the morning while Célestine is present, and comes in after\\ndinner to turn down the beds under the same conditions; otherwise\\nshe never enters the room.”\\n\\n“Well, as I was saying,” continued Mrs. Opalsen, “I came up. I went\\nto the drawer here,”—she indicated the bottom right-hand drawer of\\nthe knee-hole dressing-table—“took out my jewel-case and unlocked\\nit. It seemed quite as usual—but the pearls were not there!”\\n\\nThe inspector had been busy with his notebook. “When had you last\\nseen them?” he asked.\\n\\n“They were there when I went down to dinner.”\\n\\n“You are sure?”\\n\\n“Quite sure. I was uncertain whether to wear them or not, but in\\nthe end I decided on the emeralds, and put them back in the\\njewel-case.”\\n\\n“Who locked up the jewel-case?”\\n\\n“I did. I wear the key on a chain round my neck.” She held it up\\nas she spoke.\\n\\nThe inspector examined it, and shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n“The thief must have had a duplicate key. No difficult matter. The\\nlock is quite a simple one. What did you do after you’d locked the\\njewel-case?”\\n\\n“I put it back in the bottom drawer where I always keep it.”\\n\\n“You didn’t lock the drawer?”\\n\\n“No, I never do. My maid remains in the room till I come up, so\\nthere’s no need.”\\n\\nThe inspector’s face grew graver.\\n\\n“Am I to understand that the jewels were there when you went down\\nto dinner, and that since then _the maid has not left the room_?”\\n\\nSuddenly, as though the horror of her own situation for the first\\ntime burst upon her, Célestine uttered a piercing shriek, and,\\nflinging herself upon Poirot, poured out a torrent of incoherent\\nFrench.\\n\\nThe suggestion was infamous! That she should be suspected of\\nrobbing Madame! The police were well known to be of a stupidity\\nincredible! But Monsieur, who was a Frenchman—\\n\\n“A Belgian,” interjected Poirot, but Célestine paid no attention\\nto the correction.\\n\\nMonsieur would not stand by and see her falsely accused, while that\\ninfamous chambermaid was allowed to go scot-free. She had never\\nliked her—a bold, red-faced thing—a born thief. She had said from\\nthe first that she was not honest. And had kept a sharp watch over\\nher too, when she was doing Madame’s room! Let those idiots of\\npolicemen search her, and if they did not find Madame’s pearls on\\nher it would be very surprising!\\n\\nAlthough this harangue was uttered in rapid and virulent French,\\nCélestine had interlarded it with a wealth of gesture, and the\\nchambermaid realized at least a part of her meaning. She reddened\\nangrily.\\n\\n“If that foreign woman’s saying I took the pearls, it’s a lie!”\\nshe declared heatedly. “I never so much as saw them.”\\n\\n“Search her!” screamed the other. “You will find it is as I say.”\\n\\n“You’re a liar—do you hear?” said the chambermaid, advancing upon\\nher. “Stole ’em yourself, and want to put it on me. Why, I was only\\nin the room about three minutes before the lady come up, and then\\nyou were sitting here the whole time, as you always do, like a cat\\nwatching a mouse.”\\n\\nThe inspector looked across inquiringly at Célestine. “Is that\\ntrue? Didn’t you leave the room at all?”\\n\\n“I did not actually leave her alone,” admitted Célestine reluctantly,\\n“but I went into my own room through the door here twice—once to\\nfetch a reel of cotton, and once for my scissors. She must have\\ndone it then.”\\n\\n“You wasn’t gone a minute,” retorted the chambermaid angrily. “Just\\npopped out and in again. I’d be glad if the police _would_ search\\nme. _I’ve nothing to be afraid of_.”\\n\\nAt this moment there was a tap at the door. The inspector went to\\nit. His face brightened when he saw who it was.\\n\\n“Ah!” he said. “That’s rather fortunate. I sent for one of our\\nfemale searchers, and she’s just arrived. Perhaps if you wouldn’t\\nmind going into the room next door.”\\n\\nHe looked at the chambermaid, who stepped across the threshold with\\na toss of her head, the searcher following her closely.\\n\\nThe French girl had sunk sobbing into a chair. Poirot was looking\\nround the room, the main features of which I have made clear by a\\nsketch.\\n\\n[A sketch of the bedroom, adjoining maid's room, and corridor.]\\n\\n“Where does that door lead?” he inquired, nodding his head towards\\nthe one by the window.\\n\\n“Into the next apartment, I believe,” said the inspector. “It’s\\nbolted, anyway, on this side.”\\n\\nPoirot walked across to it, tried it, then drew back the bolt and\\ntried it again.\\n\\n“And on the other side as well,” he remarked. “Well, that seems to\\nrule out that.”\\n\\nHe walked over to the windows, examining each of them in turn.\\n\\n“And again—nothing. Not even a balcony outside.”\\n\\n“Even if there were,” said the inspector impatiently, “I don’t see\\nhow that would help us, if the maid never left the room.”\\n\\n“_Évidemment_,” said Poirot, not disconcerted. “As Mademoiselle is\\npositive she did not leave the room——”\\n\\nHe was interrupted by the reappearance of the chambermaid and the\\npolice searcher.\\n\\n“Nothing,” said the latter laconically.\\n\\n“I should hope not, indeed,” said the chambermaid virtuously. “And\\nthat French hussy ought to be ashamed of herself taking away an\\nhonest girl’s character!”\\n\\n“There, there, my girl; that’s all right,” said the inspector,\\nopening the door. “Nobody suspects you. You go along and get on\\nwith your work.”\\n\\nThe chambermaid went unwillingly.\\n\\n“Going to search _her_?” she demanded, pointing at Célestine.\\n\\n“Yes, yes!” He shut the door on her and turned the key.\\n\\nCélestine accompanied the searcher into the small room in her turn.\\nA few minutes later she also returned. Nothing had been found on\\nher.\\n\\nThe inspector’s face grew graver.\\n\\n“I’m afraid I’ll have to ask you to come along with me all the\\nsame, miss.” He turned to Mrs. Opalsen. “I’m sorry, madam, but all\\nthe evidence points that way. If she’s not got them on her, they’re\\nhidden somewhere about the room.”\\n\\nCélestine uttered a piercing shriek, and clung to Poirot’s arm.\\nThe latter bent and whispered something in the girl’s ear. She\\nlooked up at him doubtfully.\\n\\n“_Si, si, mon enfant_—I assure you it is better not to resist.”\\nThen he turned to the inspector. “You permit, monsieur? A little\\nexperiment—purely for my own satisfaction.”\\n\\n“Depends on what it is,” replied the police officer non-committally.\\n\\nPoirot addressed Célestine once more.\\n\\n“You have told us that you went into your room to fetch a reel of\\ncotton. Whereabouts was it?”\\n\\n“On the top of the chest of drawers, monsieur.”\\n\\n“And the scissors?”\\n\\n“They also.”\\n\\n“Would it be troubling you too much, mademoiselle, to ask you to\\nrepeat those two actions? You were sitting here with your work,\\nyou say?”\\n\\nCélestine sat down, and then, at a sign from Poirot, rose, passed\\ninto the adjoining room, took up an object from the chest of\\ndrawers, and returned.\\n\\nPoirot divided his attention between her movements and a large\\nturnip of a watch which he held in the palm of his hand.\\n\\n“Again, if you please, mademoiselle.”\\n\\nAt the conclusion of the second performance, he made a note in his\\npocket-book, and returned the watch to his pocket.\\n\\n“Thank you, mademoiselle. And you, monsieur,”—he bowed to the\\ninspector—“for your courtesy.”\\n\\nThe inspector seemed somewhat entertained by this excessive\\npoliteness. Célestine departed in a flood of tears, accompanied by\\nthe woman and the plain-clothes official.\\n\\nThen, with a brief apology to Mrs. Opalsen, the inspector set to\\nwork to ransack the room. He pulled out drawers, opened cupboards,\\ncompletely unmade the bed, and tapped the floor. Mr. Opalsen looked\\non sceptically.\\n\\n“You really think you will find them?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir. It stands to reason. She hadn’t time to take them out\\nof the room. The lady’s discovering the robbery so soon upset her\\nplans. No, they’re here right enough. One of the two must have\\nhidden them—and it’s very unlikely for the chambermaid to have done\\nso.”\\n\\n“More than unlikely—impossible!” said Poirot quietly.\\n\\n“Eh?” The inspector stared.\\n\\nPoirot smiled modestly.\\n\\n“I will demonstrate. Hastings, my good friend, take my watch in\\nyour hand—with care. It is a family heirloom! Just now I timed\\nMademoiselle’s movements—her first absence from the room was of\\ntwelve seconds, her second of fifteen. Now observe my actions.\\nMadame will have the kindness to give me the key of the jewel-case.\\nI thank you. My friend Hastings will have the kindness to say\\n‘Go!’”\\n\\n“Go!” I said.\\n\\nWith almost incredible swiftness, Poirot wrenched open the drawer\\nof the dressing-table, extracted the jewel-case, fitted the key in\\nthe lock, opened the case, selected a piece of jewellery, shut and\\nlocked the case, and returned it to the drawer, which he pushed to\\nagain. His movements were like lightning.\\n\\n“Well, _mon ami_?” he demanded of me breathlessly.\\n\\n“Forty-six seconds,” I replied.\\n\\n“You see?” He looked round. “There would not have been time for\\nthe chambermaid even to take the necklace out, far less hide it.”\\n\\n“Then that settles it on the maid,” said the inspector with\\nsatisfaction, and returned to his search. He passed into the maid’s\\nbedroom next door.\\n\\nPoirot was frowning thoughtfully. Suddenly he shot a question at\\nMr. Opalsen.\\n\\n“This necklace—it was, without doubt, insured?”\\n\\nMr. Opalsen looked a trifle surprised at the question.\\n\\n“Yes,” he said hesitatingly, “that is so.”\\n\\n“But what does that matter?” broke in Mrs. Opalsen tearfully. “It’s\\nmy necklace I want. It was unique. No money could be the same.”\\n\\n“I comprehend, madame,” said Poirot soothingly. “I comprehend\\nperfectly. To _la femme_ sentiment is everything—is it not so? But\\nmonsieur, who has not the so fine susceptibility, will doubtless\\nfind some slight consolation in the fact.”\\n\\n“Of course, of course,” said Mr. Opalsen rather uncertainly.\\n“Still——”\\n\\nHe was interrupted by a shout of triumph from the inspector. He\\ncame in dangling something from his fingers.\\n\\nWith a cry, Mrs. Opalsen heaved herself up from her chair. She was\\na changed woman.\\n\\n“Oh, oh, my necklace!”\\n\\nShe clasped it to her breast with both hands. We crowded round.\\n\\n“Where was it?” demanded Opalsen.\\n\\n“Maid’s bed. In among the springs of the wire mattress. She must\\nhave stolen it and hidden it there before the chambermaid arrived\\non the scene.”\\n\\n“You permit, madame?” said Poirot gently. He took the necklace from\\nher and examined it closely; then handed it back with a bow.\\n\\n“I’m afraid, madam, you’ll have to hand it over to us for the time\\nbeing,” said the inspector. “We shall want it for the charge. But\\nit shall be returned to you as soon as possible.”\\n\\nMr. Opalsen frowned.\\n\\n“Is that necessary?”\\n\\n“I’m afraid so, sir. Just a formality.”\\n\\n“Oh, let him take it, Ed!” cried his wife. “I’d feel safer if he\\ndid. I shouldn’t sleep a wink thinking some one else might try and\\nget hold of it. That wretched girl! And I would never have believed\\nit of her.”\\n\\n“There, there, my dear, don’t take on so.”\\n\\nI felt a gentle pressure on my arm. It was Poirot.\\n\\n“Shall we slip away, my friend? I think our services are no longer\\nneeded.”\\n\\nOnce outside, however, he hesitated, and then, much to my surprise,\\nhe remarked:\\n\\n“I should rather like to see the room next door.”\\n\\nThe door was not locked, and we entered. The room, which was a\\nlarge double one, was unoccupied. Dust lay about rather noticeably,\\nand my sensitive friend gave a characteristic grimace as he ran\\nhis finger round a rectangular mark on a table near the window.\\n\\n“The _service_ leaves to be desired,” he observed dryly.\\n\\nHe was staring thoughtfully out of the window, and seemed to have\\nfallen into a brown study.\\n\\n“Well?” I demanded impatiently. “What did we come in here for?”\\n\\nHe started.\\n\\n“_Je vous demande pardon, mon ami_. I wished to see if the door\\nwas really bolted on this side also.”\\n\\n“Well,” I said, glancing at the door which communicated with the\\nroom we had just left, “it _is_ bolted.”\\n\\nPoirot nodded. He still seemed to be thinking.\\n\\n“And, anyway,” I continued, “what does it matter? The case is over.\\nI wish you’d had more chance of distinguishing yourself. But it\\nwas the kind of case that even a stiff-backed idiot like that\\ninspector couldn’t go wrong over.”\\n\\nPoirot shook his head.\\n\\n“The case is not over, my friend. It will not be over until we find\\nout who stole the pearls.”\\n\\n“But the maid did!”\\n\\n“Why do you say that?”\\n\\n“Why,” I stammered, “they were found—actually in her mattress.”\\n\\n“Ta, ta, ta!” said Poirot impatiently. “Those were not the pearls.”\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“Imitation, _mon ami_.”\\n\\nThe statement took my breath away. Poirot was smiling placidly.\\n\\n“The good inspector obviously knows nothing of jewels. But presently\\nthere will be a fine hullabaloo!”\\n\\n“Come!” I cried, dragging at his arm.\\n\\n“Where?”\\n\\n“We must tell the Opalsens at once.”\\n\\n“I think not.”\\n\\n“But that poor woman——”\\n\\n“_Eh bien_; that poor woman, as you call her, will have a much\\nbetter night believing the jewels to be safe.”\\n\\n“But the thief may escape with them!”\\n\\n“As usual, my friend, you speak without reflection. How do you know\\nthat the pearls Mrs. Opalsen locked up so carefully to-night were\\nnot the false ones, and that the real robbery did not take place\\nat a much earlier date?”\\n\\n“Oh!” I said, bewildered.\\n\\n“Exactly,” said Poirot, beaming. “We start again.”\\n\\nHe led the way out of the room, paused a moment as though\\nconsidering, and then walked down to the end of the corridor,\\nstopping outside the small den where the chambermaids and valets\\nof the respective floors congregated. Our particular chambermaid\\nappeared to be holding a small court there, and to be retailing\\nher late experiences to an appreciative audience. She stopped in\\nthe middle of a sentence. Poirot bowed with his usual politeness.\\n\\n“Excuse that I derange you, but I shall be obliged if you will\\nunlock for me the door of Mr. Opalsen’s room.”\\n\\nThe woman rose willingly, and we accompanied her down the passage\\nagain. Mr. Opalsen’s room was on the other side of the corridor,\\nits door facing that of his wife’s room. The chambermaid unlocked\\nit with her pass-key, and we entered.\\n\\nAs she was about to depart Poirot detained her.\\n\\n“One moment; have you ever seen among the effects of Mr. Opalsen\\na card like this?”\\n\\nHe held out a plain white card, rather highly glazed and uncommon\\nin appearance. The maid took it and scrutinized it carefully.\\n\\n“No, sir, I can’t say I have. But, anyway, the valet has most to\\ndo with the gentlemen’s rooms.”\\n\\n“I see. Thank you.”\\n\\nPoirot took back the card. The woman departed. Poirot appeared to\\nreflect a little. Then he gave a short, sharp nod of the head.\\n\\n“Ring the bell, I pray of you, Hastings. Three times, for the\\nvalet.”\\n\\nI obeyed, devoured with curiosity. Meanwhile Poirot had emptied\\nthe waste-paper-basket on the floor, and was swiftly going through\\nits contents.\\n\\nIn a few moments the valet answered the bell. To him Poirot put\\nthe same question, and handed him the card to examine. But the\\nresponse was the same. The valet had never seen a card of that\\nparticular quality among Mr. Opalsen’s belongings. Poirot thanked\\nhim, and he withdrew, somewhat unwillingly, with an inquisitive\\nglance at the overturned waste-paper-basket and the litter on the\\nfloor. He could hardly have helped overhearing Poirot’s thoughtful\\nremark as he bundled the torn papers back again:\\n\\n“And the necklace was heavily insured. . . .”\\n\\n“Poirot,” I cried,  “I see——”\\n\\n“You see nothing, my friend,” he replied quickly. “As usual,\\nnothing at all! It is incredible—but there it is. Let us return to\\nour own apartments.”\\n\\nWe did so in silence. Once there, to my intense surprise, Poirot\\neffected a rapid change of clothing.\\n\\n“I go to London to-night,” he explained. “It is imperative.”\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“Absolutely. The real work, that of the brain (ah, those brave\\nlittle grey cells), it is done. I go to seek the confirmation. I\\nshall find it! Impossible to deceive Hercule Poirot!”\\n\\n“You’ll come a cropper one of these days,” I observed, rather\\ndisgusted by his vanity.\\n\\n“Do not be enraged, I beg of you, _mon ami_. I count on you to do\\nme a service—of your friendship.”\\n\\n“Of course,” I said eagerly, rather ashamed of my moroseness. “What\\nis it?”\\n\\n“The sleeve of my coat that I have taken off—will you brush it?\\nSee you, a little white powder has clung to it. You without doubt\\nobserved me run my finger round the drawer of the dressing-table?”\\n\\n“No, I didn’t.”\\n\\n“You should observe my actions, my friend. Thus I obtained the\\npowder on my finger, and, being a little over-excited, I rubbed it\\non my sleeve; an action without method which I deplore—false to\\nall my principles.”\\n\\n“But what was the powder?” I asked, not particularly interested in\\nPoirot’s principles.\\n\\n“Not the poison of the Borgias,” replied Poirot, with a twinkle.\\n“I see your imagination mounting. I should say it was French\\nchalk.”\\n\\n“French chalk?”\\n\\n“Yes, cabinet-makers use it to make drawers run smoothly.”\\n\\nI laughed.\\n\\n“You old sinner! I thought you were working up to something\\nexciting.”\\n\\n“Au revoir, my friend. I save myself. I fly!”\\n\\nThe door shut behind him. With a smile, half of derision, half of\\naffection, I picked up the coat, and stretched out my hand for the\\nclothes-brush.\\n\\n\\n  •   •   •   •   •   •   •\\n\\n\\nThe next morning, hearing nothing from Poirot, I went out for a\\nstroll, met some old friends, and lunched with them at their hotel.\\nIn the afternoon we went for a spin. A punctured tyre delayed us,\\nand it was past eight when I got back to the _Grand Metropolitan_.\\n\\nThe first sight that met my eyes was Poirot, looking even more\\ndiminutive than usual, sandwiched between the Opalsens, beaming in\\na state of placid satisfaction.\\n\\n“_Mon ami_ Hastings!” he cried, and sprang to meet me. “Embrace\\nme, my friend; all has marched to a marvel!”\\n\\nLuckily, the embrace was merely figurative—not a thing one is\\nalways sure of with Poirot.\\n\\n“Do you mean——” I began.\\n\\n“Just wonderful, I call it!” said Mrs. Opalsen, smiling all over\\nher fat face. “Didn’t I tell you, Ed, that if he couldn’t get back\\nmy pearls nobody would?”\\n\\n“You did, my dear, you did. And you were right.”\\n\\nI looked helplessly at Poirot, and he answered the glance.\\n\\n“My friend Hastings is, as you say in England, all at the seaside.\\nSeat yourself, and I will recount to you all the affair that has\\nso happily ended.”\\n\\n“Ended?”\\n\\n“But yes. They are arrested.”\\n\\n“Who are arrested?”\\n\\n“The chambermaid and the valet, _parbleu_! You did not suspect?\\nNot with my parting hint about the French chalk?”\\n\\n“You said cabinet-makers used it.”\\n\\n“Certainly they do—to make drawers slide easily. Somebody wanted\\nthat drawer to slide in and out without any noise. Who could that\\nbe? Obviously, only the chambermaid. The plan was so ingenious that\\nit did not at once leap to the eye—not even to the eye of Hercule\\nPoirot.\\n\\n“Listen, this was how it was done. The valet was in the empty room\\nnext door, waiting. The French maid leaves the room. Quick as a\\nflash the chambermaid whips open the drawer, takes out the\\njewel-case, and, slipping back the bolt, passes it through the\\ndoor. The valet opens it at his leisure with the duplicate key with\\nwhich he has provided himself, extracts the necklace, and waits\\nhis time. Célestine leaves the room again, and—pst!—in a flash the\\ncase is passed back again and replaced in the drawer.\\n\\n“Madame arrives, the theft is discovered. The chambermaid demands\\nto be searched, with a good deal of righteous indignation, and\\nleaves the room without a stain on her character. The imitation\\nnecklace with which they have provided themselves has been concealed\\nin the French girl’s bed that morning by the chambermaid—a master\\nstroke, _ça!_”\\n\\n“But what did you go to London for?”\\n\\n“You remember the card?”\\n\\n“Certainly. It puzzled me—and puzzles me still. I thought——”\\n\\nI hesitated delicately, glancing at Mr. Opalsen.\\n\\nPoirot laughed heartily.\\n\\n“_Une blague!_ For the benefit of the valet. The card was one with\\na specially prepared surface—for finger-prints. I went straight\\nto Scotland Yard, asked for our old friend Inspector Japp, and laid\\nthe facts before him. As I had suspected, the finger-prints proved\\nto be those of two well-known jewel thieves who have been ‘wanted’\\nfor some time. Japp came down with me, the thieves were arrested,\\nand the necklace was discovered in the valet’s possession. A clever\\npair, but they failed in _method_. Have I not told you, Hastings,\\nat least thirty-six times, that without method——”\\n\\n“At least thirty-six thousand times!” I interrupted. “But where\\ndid their ‘method’ break down?”\\n\\n“_Mon ami_, it is a good plan to take a place as chambermaid or\\nvalet—but you must not shirk your work. They left an empty room\\nundusted; and therefore, when the man put down the jewel-case on\\nthe little table near the communicating door, it left a square\\nmark——”\\n\\n“I remember,” I cried.\\n\\n“Before, I was undecided. Then—I _knew_!” There was a moment’s\\nsilence.\\n\\n“And I’ve got my pearls,” said Mrs. Opalsen as a sort of Greek\\nchorus.\\n\\n“Well,” I said, “I’d better have some dinner.” Poirot accompanied\\nme.\\n\\n“This ought to mean kudos for you,” I observed.\\n\\n“_Pas du tout_,” replied Poirot tranquilly. “Japp and the local\\ninspector will divide the credit between them. But”—he tapped his\\npocket—“I have a cheque here, from Mr. Opalsen, and, how say you,\\nmy friend? This week-end has not gone according to plan. Shall we\\nreturn here next week-end—at my expense this time?”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  VIII\\n\\n\\n  The Kidnapped Prime Minister\\n\\n\\nNow that war and the problems of war are things of the past, I\\nthink I may safely venture to reveal to the world the part which\\nmy friend Poirot played in a moment of national crisis. The secret\\nhas been well guarded. Not a whisper of it reached the Press. But,\\nnow that the need for secrecy has gone by, I feel it is only just\\nthat England should know the debt it owes to my quaint little\\nfriend, whose marvellous brain so ably averted a great catastrophe.\\n\\nOne evening after dinner—I will not particularize the date; it\\nsuffices to say that it was at the time when “Peace by negotiation”\\nwas the parrot-cry of England’s enemies—my friend and I were\\nsitting in his rooms. After being invalided out of the Army I had\\nbeen given a recruiting job, and it had become my custom to drop\\nin on Poirot in the evenings after dinner and talk with him of any\\ncases of interest that he might have on hand.\\n\\nI was attempting to discuss with him the sensational news of that\\nday—no less than an attempted assassination of Mr. David MacAdam,\\nEngland’s Prime Minister. The account in the papers had evidently\\nbeen carefully censored. No details were given, save that the Prime\\nMinister had had a marvellous escape, the bullet just grazing his\\ncheek.\\n\\nI considered that our police must have been shamefully careless\\nfor such an outrage to be possible. I could well understand that\\nthe German agents in England would be willing to risk much for such\\nan achievement. “Fighting Mac,” as his own party had nicknamed him,\\nhad strenuously and unequivocally combated the Pacifist influence\\nwhich was becoming so prevalent.\\n\\nHe was more than England’s Prime Minister—he _was_ England; and\\nto have removed him from his sphere of influence would have been\\na crushing and paralysing blow to Britain.\\n\\nPoirot was busy mopping a grey suit with a minute sponge. Never\\nwas there a dandy such as Hercule Poirot. Neatness and order were\\nhis passion. Now, with the odour of benzine filling the air, he\\nwas quite unable to give me his full attention.\\n\\n“In a little minute I am with you, my friend. I have all but\\nfinished. The spot of grease—he is not good—I remove him—so!” He\\nwaved his sponge.\\n\\nI smiled as I lit another cigarette.\\n\\n“Anything interesting on?” I inquired, after a minute or two.\\n\\n“I assist a—how do you call it?—‘charlady’ to find her husband. A\\ndifficult affair, needing the tact. For I have a little idea that\\nwhen he is found he will not be pleased. What would you? For my\\npart, I sympathize with him. He was a man of discrimination to lose\\nhimself.”\\n\\nI laughed.\\n\\n“At last! The spot of grease, he is gone! I am at your disposal.”\\n\\n“I was asking you what you thought of this attempt to assassinate\\nMacAdam?”\\n\\n“_Enfantillage!_” replied Poirot promptly. “One can hardly take it\\nseriously. To fire with the rifle—never does it succeed. It is a\\ndevice of the past.”\\n\\n“It was very near succeeding this time,” I reminded him.\\n\\nPoirot shook his head impatiently. He was about to reply when the\\nlandlady thrust her head round the door and informed him that there\\nwere two gentlemen below who wanted to see him.\\n\\n“They won’t give their names, sir, but they says as it’s very\\nimportant.”\\n\\n“Let them mount,” said Poirot, carefully folding his grey trousers.\\n\\nIn a few minutes the two visitors were ushered in, and my heart\\ngave a leap as in the foremost I recognized no less a personage\\nthan Lord Estair, Leader of the House of Commons; whilst his\\ncompanion, Mr. Bernard Dodge, was also a member of the War Cabinet,\\nand, as I knew, a close personal friend of the Prime Minister.\\n\\n“Monsieur Poirot?” said Lord Estair interrogatively. My friend\\nbowed. The great man looked at me and hesitated. “My business is\\nprivate.”\\n\\n“You may speak freely before Captain Hastings,” said my friend,\\nnodding to me to remain. “He has not all the gifts, no! But I\\nanswer for his discretion.”\\n\\nLord Estair still hesitated, but Mr. Dodge broke in abruptly:\\n\\n“Oh, come on—don’t let’s beat about the bush! As far as I can see,\\nthe whole of England will know the hole we’re in soon enough.\\nTime’s everything.”\\n\\n“Pray be seated, messieurs,” said Poirot politely. “Will you take\\nthe big chair, _milord_?”\\n\\nLord Estair started slightly. “You know me?”\\n\\nPoirot smiled. “Certainly. I read the little papers with the\\npictures. How should I not know you?”\\n\\n“Monsieur Poirot, I have come to consult you upon a matter of the\\nmost vital urgency. I must ask for absolute secrecy.”\\n\\n“You have the word of Hercule Poirot—I can say no more!” said my\\nfriend grandiloquently.\\n\\n“It concerns the Prime Minister. We are in grave trouble.”\\n\\n“We’re up a tree!” interposed Mr. Dodge.\\n\\n“The injury is serious, then?” I asked.\\n\\n“What injury?”\\n\\n“The bullet wound.”\\n\\n“Oh, that!” cried Mr. Dodge contemptuously. “That’s old history.”\\n\\n“As my colleague says,” continued Lord Estair, “that affair is over\\nand done with. Luckily, it failed. I wished I could say as much\\nfor the second attempt.”\\n\\n“There has been a second attempt, then?”\\n\\n“Yes, though not of the same nature. Monsieur Poirot, the Prime\\nMinister has disappeared.”\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“He has been kidnapped!”\\n\\n“Impossible!” I cried, stupefied.\\n\\nPoirot threw a withering glance at me, which I knew enjoined me to\\nkeep my mouth shut.\\n\\n“Unfortunately, impossible as it seems, it is only too true,”\\ncontinued his lordship.\\n\\nPoirot looked at Mr. Dodge. “You said just now, monsieur, that time\\nwas everything. What did you mean by that?”\\n\\nThe two men exchanged glances, and then Lord Estair said:\\n\\n“You have heard, Monsieur Poirot, of the approaching Allied\\nConference?”\\n\\nMy friend nodded.\\n\\n“For obvious reasons, no details have been given of when and where\\nit is to take place. But, although it has been kept out of the\\nnewspapers, the date is, of course, widely known in diplomatic\\ncircles. The Conference is to be held to-morrow—Thursday—evening\\nat Versailles. Now you perceive the terrible gravity of the\\nsituation. I will not conceal from you that the Prime Minister’s\\npresence at the Conference is a vital necessity. The Pacifist\\npropaganda, started and maintained by the German agents in our\\nmidst, has been very active. It is the universal opinion that the\\nturning point of the Conference will be the strong personality of\\nthe Prime Minister. His absence may have the most serious\\nresults—possibly a premature and disastrous peace. And we have no\\none who can be sent in his place. He alone can represent England.”\\n\\nPoirot’s face had grown very grave. “Then you regard the kidnapping\\nof the Prime Minister as a direct attempt to prevent his being\\npresent at the Conference?”\\n\\n“Most certainly I do. He was actually on his way to France at the\\ntime.”\\n\\n“And the Conference is to be held?”\\n\\n“At nine o’clock to-morrow night.”\\n\\nPoirot drew an enormous watch from his pocket.\\n\\n“It is now a quarter to nine.”\\n\\n“Twenty-four hours,” said Mr. Dodge thoughtfully.\\n\\n“And a quarter,” amended Poirot. “Do not forget the quarter,\\nmonsieur—it may come in useful. Now for the details—the abduction,\\ndid it take place in England or in France?”\\n\\n“In France. Mr. MacAdam crossed to France this morning. He was to\\nstay to-night as the guest of the Commander-in-Chief, proceeding\\nto-morrow to Paris. He was conveyed across the Channel by destroyer.\\nAt Boulogne he was met by a car from General Headquarters and one\\nof the Commander-in-Chief’s A.D.C.s.”\\n\\n“_Eh bien_?”\\n\\n“Well, they started from Boulogne—but they never arrived.”\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“Monsieur Poirot, it was a bogus car and a bogus A.D.C. The real\\ncar was found in a side road, with the chauffeur and the A.D.C.\\nneatly gagged and bound.”\\n\\n“And the bogus car?”\\n\\n“Is still at large.”\\n\\nPoirot made a gesture of impatience. “Incredible! Surely it cannot\\nescape attention for long?”\\n\\n“So we thought. It seemed merely a question of searching thoroughly.\\nThat part of France is under Military Law. We were convinced that\\nthe car could not go long unnoticed. The French police and our own\\nScotland Yard men, and the military are straining every nerve. It\\nis, as you say, incredible—but nothing has been discovered!”\\n\\nAt that moment a tap came at the door, and a young officer entered\\nwith a heavily sealed envelope which he handed to Lord Estair.\\n\\n“Just through from France, sir. I brought it on here, as you\\ndirected.”\\n\\nThe Minister tore it open eagerly, and uttered an exclamation. The\\nofficer withdrew.\\n\\n“Here is news at last! This telegram has just been decoded. They\\nhave found the second car, also the secretary, Daniels, chloroformed,\\ngagged, and bound, in an abandoned farm near C——. He remembers\\nnothing, except something being pressed against his mouth and nose\\nfrom behind, and struggling to free himself. The police are\\nsatisfied as to the genuineness of his statement.”\\n\\n“And they have found nothing else?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“Not the Prime Minister’s dead body? Then, there is hope. But it\\nis strange. Why, after trying to shoot him this morning, are they\\nnow taking so much trouble to keep him alive?”\\n\\nDodge shook his head. “One thing’s quite certain. They’re determined\\nat all costs to prevent his attending the Conference.”\\n\\n“If it is humanly possible, the Prime Minister shall be there. God\\ngrant it is not too late. Now, messieurs, recount to me\\neverything—from the beginning. I must know about this shooting\\naffair as well.”\\n\\n“Last night, the Prime Minister, accompanied by one of his\\nsecretaries, Captain Daniels——”\\n\\n“The same who accompanied him to France?”\\n\\n“Yes. As I was saying, they motored down to Windsor, where the\\nPrime Minister was granted an Audience. Early this morning, he\\nreturned to town, and it was on the way that the attempted\\nassassination took place.”\\n\\n“One moment, if you please. Who is this Captain Daniels? You have\\nhis dossier?”\\n\\nLord Estair smiled. “I thought you would ask me that. We do not\\nknow very much of him. He is of no particular family. He has served\\nin the English Army, and is an extremely able secretary, being an\\nexceptionally fine linguist. I believe he speaks seven languages.\\nIt is for that reason that the Prime Minister chose him to accompany\\nhim to France.”\\n\\n“Has he any relatives in England?”\\n\\n“Two aunts. A Mrs. Everard, who lives at Hampstead, and a Miss\\nDaniels, who lives near Ascot.”\\n\\n“Ascot? That is near to Windsor, is it not?”\\n\\n“That point has not been overlooked. But it has led to nothing.”\\n\\n“You regard the Capitaine Daniels, then, as above suspicion?”\\n\\nA shade of bitterness crept into Lord Estair’s voice, as he replied:\\n\\n“No, Monsieur Poirot. In these days, I should hesitate before I\\npronounced _anyone_ above suspicion.”\\n\\n“_Très bien_. Now I understand, _milord_, that the Prime Minister\\nwould, as a matter of course, be under vigilant police protection,\\nwhich ought to render any assault upon him an impossibility?”\\n\\nLord Estair bowed his head. “That is so. The Prime Minister’s car\\nwas closely followed by another car containing detectives in plain\\nclothes. Mr. MacAdam knew nothing of these precautions. He is\\npersonally a most fearless man, and would be inclined to sweep them\\naway arbitrarily. But, naturally, the police make their own\\narrangements. In fact, the Premier’s chauffeur, O’Murphy, is a\\nC.I.D. man.”\\n\\n“O’Murphy? That is a name of Ireland, is it not so?”\\n\\n“Yes, he is an Irishman.”\\n\\n“From what part of Ireland?”\\n\\n“County Clare, I believe.”\\n\\n“_Tiens!_ But proceed, _milord_.”\\n\\n“The Premier started for London. The car was a closed one. He and\\nCaptain Daniels sat inside. The second car followed as usual. But,\\nunluckily, for some unknown reason, the Prime Minister’s car\\ndeviated from the main road——”\\n\\n“At a point where the road curves?” interrupted Poirot.\\n\\n“Yes—but how did you know?”\\n\\n“Oh, _c’est évident_! Continue!”\\n\\n“For some unknown reason,” continued Lord Estair, “the Premier’s\\ncar left the main road. The police car, unaware of the deviation,\\ncontinued to keep to the high road. At a short distance down the\\nunfrequented lane, the Prime Minister’s car was suddenly held up\\nby a band of masked men. The chauffeur——”\\n\\n“That brave O’Murphy!” murmured Poirot thoughtfully.\\n\\n“The chauffeur, momentarily taken aback, jammed on the brakes. The\\nPrime Minister put his head out of the window. Instantly a shot\\nrang out—then another. The first one grazed his cheek, the second,\\nfortunately, went wide. The chauffeur, now realizing the danger,\\ninstantly forged straight ahead, scattering the band of men.”\\n\\n“A near escape,” I ejaculated, with a shiver.\\n\\n“Mr. MacAdam refused to make any fuss over the slight wound he had\\nreceived. He declared it was only a scratch. He stopped at a local\\ncottage hospital, where it was dressed and bound up—he did not, of\\ncourse, reveal his identity. He then drove, as per schedule,\\nstraight to Charing Cross, where a special train for Dover was\\nawaiting him, and, after a brief account of what had happened had\\nbeen given to the anxious police by Captain Daniels, he duly\\ndeparted for France. At Dover, he went on board the waiting\\ndestroyer. At Boulogne, as you know, the bogus car was waiting for\\nhim, carrying the Union Jack, and correct in every detail.”\\n\\n“That is all you have to tell me?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“There is no other circumstance that you have omitted, milord?”\\n\\n“Well, there is one rather peculiar thing.”\\n\\n“Yes?”\\n\\n“The Prime Minister’s car did not return home after leaving the\\nPrime Minister at Charing Cross. The police were anxious to\\ninterview O’Murphy, so a search was instituted at once. The car\\nwas discovered standing outside a certain unsavoury little\\nrestaurant in Soho, which is well known as a meeting-place of\\nGerman agents.”\\n\\n“And the chauffeur?”\\n\\n“The chauffeur was nowhere to be found. He, too, had disappeared.”\\n\\n“So,” said Poirot thoughtfully, “there are two disappearances: the\\nPrime Minister in France, and O’Murphy in London.”\\n\\nHe looked keenly at Lord Estair, who made a gesture of despair.\\n\\n“I can only tell you, Monsieur Poirot, that, if anyone had suggested\\nto me yesterday that O’Murphy was a traitor, I should have laughed\\nin his face.”\\n\\n“And to-day?”\\n\\n“To-day I do not know what to think.”\\n\\nPoirot nodded gravely. He looked at his turnip of a watch again.\\n\\n“I understand that I have carte blanche, messieurs—in every way,\\nI mean? I must be able to go where I choose, and how I choose.”\\n\\n“Perfectly. There is a special train leaving for Dover in an hour’s\\ntime, with a further contingent from Scotland Yard. You shall be\\naccompanied by a Military officer and a C.I.D. man, who will hold\\nthemselves at your disposal in every way. Is that satisfactory?”\\n\\n“Quite. One more question before you leave, messieurs. What made\\nyou come to me? I am unknown, obscure, in this great London of\\nyours.”\\n\\n“We sought you out on the express recommendation and wish of a very\\ngreat man of your own country.”\\n\\n“_Comment?_ My old friend the _Préfet_——?”\\n\\nLord Estair shook his head.\\n\\n“One higher than the _Préfet_. One whose word was once law in\\nBelgium—and shall be again! That England has sworn!”\\n\\nPoirot’s hand flew swiftly to a dramatic salute. “Amen to that!\\nAh, but my Master does not forget. . . . Messieurs, I, Hercule\\nPoirot, will serve you faithfully. Heaven only send that it will\\nbe in time. But this is dark—dark. . . . I cannot see.”\\n\\n“Well, Poirot,” I cried impatiently, as the door closed behind the\\nMinisters, “what do you think?”\\n\\nMy friend was busy packing a minute suitcase, with quick, deft\\nmovements. He shook his head thoughtfully.\\n\\n“I do not know what to think. My brains desert me.”\\n\\n“Why, as you said, kidnap him, when a knock on the head would do\\nas well?” I mused.\\n\\n“Pardon me, _mon ami_, but I did not quite say that. It is\\nundoubtedly far more their affair to kidnap him.”\\n\\n“But why?”\\n\\n“Because uncertainty creates panic. That is one reason. Were the\\nPrime Minister dead, it would be a terrible calamity, but the\\nsituation would have to be faced. But now you have paralysis. Will\\nthe Prime Minister reappear, or will he not? Is he dead or alive?\\nNobody knows, and until they know nothing definite can be done.\\nAnd, as I tell you, uncertainty breeds panic, which is what _les\\nBoches_ are playing for. Then, again, if the kidnappers are holding\\nhim secretly somewhere, they have the advantage of being able to\\nmake terms with both sides. The German Government is not a liberal\\npaymaster, as a rule, but no doubt they can be made to disgorge\\nsubstantial remittances in such a case as this. Thirdly, they run\\nno risk of the hangman’s rope. Oh, decidedly, kidnapping is their\\naffair.”\\n\\n“Then, if that is so, why should they first try to shoot him?”\\n\\nPoirot made a gesture of anger. “Ah, that is just what I do not\\nunderstand! It is inexplicable—stupid! They have all their\\narrangements made (and very good arrangements too!) for the\\nabduction, and yet they imperil the whole affair by a melodramatic\\nattack, worthy of a Cinema, and quite as unreal. It is almost\\nimpossible to believe in it, with its band of masked men, not\\ntwenty miles from London!”\\n\\n“Perhaps they were two quite separate attempts which happened\\nirrespective of each other,” I suggested.\\n\\n“Ah, no, that would be too much of a coincidence! Then, further—who\\nis the traitor? There must have been a traitor—in the first affair,\\nanyway. But who was it—Daniels or O’Murphy? It must have been one\\nof the two, or why did the car leave the main road? We cannot\\nsuppose that the Prime Minister connived at his own assassination!\\nDid O’Murphy take that turning of his own accord, or was it Daniels\\nwho told him to do so?”\\n\\n“Surely it must have been O’Murphy’s doing.”\\n\\n“Yes, because if it was Daniels’ the Prime Minister would have\\nheard the order, and would have asked the reason. But there are\\naltogether too many ‘whys’ in this affair, and they contradict each\\nother. If O’Murphy is an honest man, _why_ did he leave the main\\nroad? But if he was a dishonest man, _why_ did he start the car\\nagain when only two shots had been fired—thereby, in all probability,\\nsaving the Prime Minister’s life? And, again, if he was honest,\\nwhy did he, immediately on leaving Charing Cross, drive to a\\nwell-known rendezvous of German spies?”\\n\\n“It looks bad,” I said.\\n\\n“Let us look at the case with method. What have we for and against\\nthese two men? Take O’Murphy first. Against: that his conduct in\\nleaving the main road was suspicious; that he is an Irishman from\\nCounty Clare; that he has disappeared in a highly suggestive\\nmanner. For: that his promptness in restarting the car saved the\\nPremier’s life; that he is a Scotland Yard man, and, obviously,\\nfrom the post allotted to him, a trusted detective. Now for Daniels.\\nThere is not much against him, except the fact that nothing is\\nknown of his antecedents, and that he speaks too many languages\\nfor a good Englishman! (Pardon me, _mon ami_, but, as linguists,\\nyou are deplorable!) _Now for him_, we have the fact that he was\\nfound gagged, bound, and chloroformed—which does not look as though\\nhe had anything to do with the matter.”\\n\\n“He might have gagged and bound himself, to divert suspicion.”\\n\\nPoirot shook his head. “The French police would make no mistake of\\nthat kind. Besides, once he had attained his object, and the Prime\\nMinister was safely abducted, there would not be much point in his\\nremaining behind. His accomplices _could_ have gagged and\\nchloroformed him, of course, but I fail to see what object they\\nhoped to accomplish by it. He can be of little use to them now,\\nfor, until the circumstances concerning the Prime Minister have\\nbeen cleared up, he is bound to be closely watched.”\\n\\n“Perhaps he hoped to start the police on a false scent?”\\n\\n“Then why did he not do so? He merely says that something was\\npressed over his nose and mouth, and that he remembers nothing\\nmore. There is no false scent there. It sounds remarkably like the\\ntruth.”\\n\\n“Well,” I said, glancing at the clock, “I suppose we’d better start\\nfor the station. You may find more clues in France.”\\n\\n“Possibly, _mon ami_, but I doubt it. It is still incredible to me\\nthat the Prime Minister has not been discovered in that limited\\narea, where the difficulty of concealing him must be tremendous.\\nIf the military and the police of two countries have not found him,\\nhow shall I?”\\n\\nAt Charing Cross we were met by Mr. Dodge.\\n\\n“This is Detective Barnes, of Scotland Yard, and Major Norman. They\\nwill hold themselves entirely at your disposal. Good luck to you.\\nIt’s a bad business, but I’ve not given up hope. Must be off now.”\\nAnd the Minister strode rapidly away.\\n\\nWe chatted in a desultory fashion with Major Norman. In the centre\\nof the little group of men on the platform I recognized a little\\nferret-faced fellow talking to a tall, fair man. He was an old\\nacquaintance of Poirot’s—Detective-Inspector Japp, supposed to be\\none of the smartest of Scotland Yard’s officers. He came over and\\ngreeted my friend cheerfully.\\n\\n“I heard you were on this job too. Smart bit of work. So far\\nthey’ve got away with the goods all right. But I can’t believe they\\ncan keep him hidden long. Our people are going through France with\\na toothcomb. So are the French. I can’t help feeling it’s only a\\nmatter of hours now.”\\n\\n“That is, if he’s still alive,” remarked the tall detective\\ngloomily.\\n\\nJapp’s face fell. “Yes. . . . But somehow I’ve got the feeling he’s\\nalive all right.”\\n\\nPoirot nodded. “Yes, yes; he’s alive. But can he be found in time?\\nI, like you, did not believe he could be hidden so long.”\\n\\nThe whistle blew, and we all trooped up into the Pullman car. Then,\\nwith a slow, unwilling jerk, the train drew out of the station.\\n\\nIt was a curious journey. The Scotland Yard men crowded together.\\nMaps of Northern France were spread out, and eager forefingers\\ntraced the lines of roads and villages. Each man had his own pet\\ntheory. Poirot showed none of his usual loquacity, but sat staring\\nin front of him, with an expression on his face that reminded me\\nof a puzzled child. I talked to Norman, whom I found quite an\\namusing fellow. On arriving at Dover Poirot’s behaviour moved me\\nto intense amusement. The little man, as he went on board the boat,\\nclutched desperately at my arm. The wind was blowing lustily.\\n\\n“_Mon Dieu!_” he murmured. “This is terrible!”\\n\\n“Have courage, Poirot,” I cried. “You will succeed. You will find\\nhim. I am sure of it.”\\n\\n“Ah, _mon ami_, you mistake my emotion. It is this villainous sea\\nthat troubles me! The _mal de mer_—it is horrible suffering!”\\n\\n“Oh!” I said, rather taken aback.\\n\\nThe first throb of the engines was felt, and Poirot groaned and\\nclosed his eyes.\\n\\n“Major Norman has a map of Northern France if you would like to\\nstudy it?”\\n\\nPoirot shook his head impatiently.\\n\\n“But no, but no! Leave me, my friend. See you, to think, the\\nstomach and the brain must be in harmony. Laverguier has a method\\nmost excellent for averting the _mal de mer_. You breathe in—and\\nout—slowly, so—turning the head from left to right and counting\\nsix between each breath.”\\n\\nI left him to his gymnastic endeavours, and went on deck.\\n\\nAs we came slowly into Boulogne Harbour Poirot appeared, neat and\\nsmiling, and announced to me in a whisper that Laverguier’s system\\nhad succeeded “to a marvel!”\\n\\nJapp’s forefinger was still tracing imaginary routes on his map.\\n“Nonsense! The car started from Boulogne—here they branched off.\\nNow, my idea is that they transferred the Prime Minister to another\\ncar. See?”\\n\\n“Well,” said the tall detective, “I shall make for the seaports.\\nTen to one, they’ve smuggled him on board a ship.”\\n\\nJapp shook his head. “Too obvious. The order went out at once to\\nclose all the ports.”\\n\\nThe day was just breaking as we landed. Major Norman touched Poirot\\non the arm. “There’s a military car here waiting for you, sir.”\\n\\n“Thank you, monsieur. But, for the moment, I do not propose to\\nleave Boulogne.”\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“No, we will enter this hotel here, by the quay.”\\n\\nHe suited the action to the word, demanded and was accorded a\\nprivate room. We three followed him, puzzled and uncomprehending.\\n\\nHe shot a quick glance at us. “It is not so that the good detective\\nshould act, eh? I perceive your thought. He must be full of energy.\\nHe must rush to and fro. He should prostrate himself on the dusty\\nroad and seek the marks of tyres through a little glass. He must\\ngather up the cigarette-end, the fallen match? That is your idea,\\nis it not?”\\n\\nHis eyes challenged us. “But I—Hercule Poirot—tell you that it is\\nnot so! The true clues are within—_here_!” He tapped his forehead.\\n“See you, I need not have left London. It would have been sufficient\\nfor me to sit quietly in my rooms there. All that matters is the\\nlittle grey cells within. Secretly and silently they do their part,\\nuntil suddenly I call for a map, and I lay my finger on a\\nspot—so—and I say: the Prime Minister is _there_! And it is so!\\nWith method and logic one can accomplish anything! This frantic\\nrushing to France was a mistake—it is playing a child’s game of\\nhide-and-seek. But now, though it may be too late, I will set to\\nwork the right way, from within. Silence, my friends, I beg of\\nyou.”\\n\\nAnd for five long hours the little man sat motionless, blinking\\nhis eyelids like a cat, his green eyes flickering and becoming\\nsteadily greener and greener. The Scotland Yard man was obviously\\ncontemptuous, Major Norman was bored and impatient, and I myself\\nfound the time pass with wearisome slowness.\\n\\nFinally, I got up, and strolled as noiselessly as I could to the\\nwindow. The matter was becoming a farce. I was secretly concerned\\nfor my friend. If he failed, I would have preferred him to fail in\\na less ridiculous manner. Out of the window I idly watched the\\ndaily leave boat, belching forth columns of smoke, as she lay\\nalongside the quay.\\n\\nSuddenly I was aroused by Poirot’s voice close to my elbow.\\n\\n“_Mes amis_, let us start!”\\n\\nI turned. An extraordinary transformation had come over my friend.\\nHis eyes were flickering with excitement, his chest was swelled to\\nthe uttermost.\\n\\n“I have been an imbecile, my friends! But I see daylight at last.”\\n\\nMajor Norman moved hastily to the door. “I’ll order the car.”\\n\\n“There is no need. I shall not use it. Thank Heaven the wind has\\nfallen.”\\n\\n“Do you mean you are going to walk, sir?”\\n\\n“No, my young friend. I am no St. Peter. I prefer to cross the sea\\nby boat.”\\n\\n“To cross the _sea_?”\\n\\n“Yes. To work with method, one must begin from the beginning. And\\nthe beginning of this affair was in England. Therefore, we return\\nto England.”\\n\\n\\n  •   •   •   •   •   •   •\\n\\n\\nAt three o’clock, we stood once more upon Charing Cross platform.\\nTo all our expostulations, Poirot turned a deaf ear, and reiterated\\nagain and again that to start at the beginning was not a waste of\\ntime, but the only way. On the way over, he had conferred with\\nNorman in a low voice, and the latter had despatched a sheaf of\\ntelegrams from Dover.\\n\\nOwing to the special passes held by Norman, we got through\\neverywhere in record time. In London, a large police car was\\nwaiting for us, with some plain-clothes men, one of whom handed a\\ntypewritten sheet of paper to my friend. He answered my inquiring\\nglance.\\n\\n“A list of the cottage hospitals within a certain radius west of\\nLondon. I wired for it from Dover.”\\n\\nWe were whirled rapidly through the London streets. We were on the\\nBath Road. On we went, through Hammersmith, Chiswick and Brentford.\\nI began to see our objective. Through Windsor and on to Ascot. My\\nheart gave a leap. Ascot was where Daniels had an aunt living. We\\nwere after _him_, then, not O’Murphy.\\n\\nWe duly stopped at the gate of a trim villa. Poirot jumped out and\\nrang the bell. I saw a perplexed frown dimming the radiance of his\\nface. Plainly, he was not satisfied. The bell was answered. He was\\nushered inside. In a few moments he reappeared, and climbed into\\nthe car with a short, sharp shake of his head. My hopes began to\\ndie down. It was past four now. Even if he found certain evidence\\nincriminating Daniels, what would be the good of it, unless he\\ncould wring from some one the exact spot in France where they were\\nholding the Prime Minister?\\n\\nOur return progress towards London was an interrupted one. We\\ndeviated from the main road more than once, and occasionally\\nstopped at a small building, which I had no difficulty in\\nrecognizing as a cottage hospital. Poirot only spent a few minutes\\nat each, but at every halt his radiant assurance was more and more\\nrestored.\\n\\nHe whispered something to Norman, to which the latter replied:\\n\\n“Yes, if you turn off to the left, you will find them waiting by\\nthe bridge.”\\n\\nWe turned up a side road, and in the failing light I discerned a\\nsecond car, waiting by the side of the road. It contained two men\\nin plain clothes. Poirot got down and spoke to them, and then we\\nstarted off in a northerly direction, the other car following close\\nbehind.\\n\\nWe drove for some time, our objective being obviously one of the\\nnorthern suburbs of London. Finally, we drove up to the front door\\nof a tall house, standing a little back from the road in its own\\ngrounds.\\n\\nNorman and I were left with the car. Poirot and one of the\\ndetectives went up to the door and rang. A neat parlourmaid opened\\nit. The detective spoke.\\n\\n“I am a police officer, and I have a warrant to search this house.”\\n\\nThe girl gave a little scream, and a tall, handsome woman of\\nmiddle-age appeared behind her in the hall.\\n\\n“Shut the door, Edith. They are burglars, I expect.”\\n\\nBut Poirot swiftly inserted his foot in the door, and at the same\\nmoment blew a whistle. Instantly the other detectives ran up, and\\npoured into the house, shutting the door behind them.\\n\\nNorman and I spent about five minutes cursing our forced inactivity.\\nFinally the door reopened, and the men emerged, escorting three\\nprisoners—a woman and two men. The woman, and one of the men, were\\ntaken to the second car. The other man was placed in our car by\\nPoirot himself.\\n\\n“I must go with the others, my friend. But have great care of this\\ngentleman. You do not know him, no? _Eh bien_, let me present to\\nyou, Monsieur O’Murphy!”\\n\\nO’Murphy! I _gaped_ at him open-mouthed as we started again. He\\nwas not handcuffed, but I did not fancy he would try to escape. He\\nsat there staring in front of him as though dazed. Anyway, Norman\\nand I would be more than a match for him.\\n\\nTo my surprise, we still kept a northerly route. We were not\\nreturning to London, then! I was much puzzled. Suddenly, as the\\ncar slowed down, I recognized that we were close to Hendon\\nAerodrome. Immediately I grasped Poirot’s idea. He proposed to\\nreach France by aeroplane.\\n\\nIt was a sporting idea, but, on the face of it, impracticable. A\\ntelegram would be far quicker. Time was everything. He must leave\\nthe personal glory of rescuing the Prime Minister to others.\\n\\nAs we drew up, Major Norman jumped out, and a plain-clothes man\\ntook his place. He conferred with Poirot for a few minutes, and\\nthen went off briskly.\\n\\nI, too, jumped out, and caught Poirot by the arm.\\n\\n“I congratulate you, old fellow! They have told you the hiding-place?\\nBut, look here, you must wire to France at once. You’ll be too late\\nif you go yourself.”\\n\\nPoirot looked at me curiously for a minute or two.\\n\\n“Unfortunately, my friend, there are some things that cannot be\\nsent by telegram.”\\n\\n\\n  •   •   •   •   •   •   •\\n\\n\\nAt that moment Major Norman returned, accompanied by a young\\nofficer in the uniform of the Flying Corps.\\n\\n“This is Captain Lyall, who will fly you over to France. He can\\nstart at once.”\\n\\n“Wrap up warmly, sir,” said the young pilot. “I can lend you a\\ncoat, if you like.”\\n\\nPoirot was consulting his enormous watch. He murmured to himself:\\n“Yes, there is time—just time.” Then he looked up, and bowed\\npolitely to the young officer. “I thank you, monsieur. But it is\\nnot I who am your passenger. It is this gentleman here.”\\n\\nHe moved a little aside as he spoke, and a figure came forward out\\nof the darkness. It was the second male prisoner who had gone in\\nthe other car, and as the light fell on his face, I gave a gasp of\\nsurprise.\\n\\n_It was the Prime Minister!_\\n\\n\\n  •   •   •   •   •   •   •\\n\\n\\n“For Heaven’s sake, tell me all about it,” I cried impatiently, as\\nPoirot, Norman, and I motored back to London. “How in the world\\ndid they manage to smuggle him back to England?”\\n\\n“There was no need to smuggle him back,” replied Poirot dryly. “The\\nPrime Minister has never left England. He was kidnapped on his way\\nfrom Windsor to London.”\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“I will make all clear. The Prime Minister was in his car, his\\nsecretary beside him. Suddenly a pad of chloroform is clapped on\\nhis face——”\\n\\n“But by whom?”\\n\\n“By the clever linguistic Captain Daniels. As soon as the Prime\\nMinister is unconscious, Daniels picks up the speaking-tube, and\\ndirects O’Murphy to turn to the right, which the chauffeur, quite\\nunsuspicious, does. A few yards down that unfrequented road, a\\nlarge car is standing, apparently broken down. Its driver signals\\nto O’Murphy to stop. O’Murphy slows up. The stranger approaches.\\nDaniels leans out of the window, and, probably with the aid of an\\ninstantaneous anæsthetic, such as ethylchloride, the chloroform\\ntrick is repeated. In a few seconds, the two helpless men are\\ndragged out and transferred to the other car, and a pair of\\nsubstitutes take their places.”\\n\\n“Impossible!”\\n\\n“_Pas du tout!_ Have you not seen music-hall turns imitating\\ncelebrities with marvellous accuracy? Nothing is easier than to\\npersonate a public character. The Prime Minister of England is far\\neasier to understudy than Mr. John Smith of Clapham, say. As for\\nO’Murphy’s ‘double,’ no one was going to take much notice of him\\nuntil after the departure of the Prime Minister, and by then he\\nwould have made himself scarce. He drives straight from Charing\\nCross to the meeting-place of his friends. He goes in as O’Murphy,\\nhe emerges as some one quite different. O’Murphy has disappeared,\\nleaving a conveniently suspicious trail behind him.”\\n\\n“But the man who personated the Prime Minister was seen by every\\none!”\\n\\n“He was not seen by anyone who knew him privately or intimately.\\nAnd Daniels shielded him from contact with anyone as much as\\npossible. Moreover, his face was bandaged up, and anything unusual\\nin his manner would be put down to the fact that he was suffering\\nfrom shock as a result of the attempt upon his life. Mr. MacAdam\\nhas a weak throat, and always spares his voice as much as possible\\nbefore any great speech. The deception was perfectly easy to keep\\nup as far as France. There it would be impracticable and\\nimpossible—so the Prime Minister disappears. The police of this\\ncountry hurry across the Channel, and no one bothers to go into\\nthe details of the first attack. To sustain the illusion that the\\nabduction has taken place in France, Daniels is gagged and\\nchloroformed in a convincing manner.”\\n\\n“And the man who has enacted the part of the Prime Minister?”\\n\\n“Rids himself of his disguise. He and the bogus chauffeur may be\\narrested as suspicious characters, but no one will dream of\\nsuspecting their real part in the drama, and they will eventually\\nbe released for lack of evidence.”\\n\\n“And the real Prime Minister?”\\n\\n“He and O’Murphy were driven straight to the house of ‘Mrs.\\nEverard,’ at Hampstead, Daniels’ so-called ‘aunt.’ In reality, she\\nis Frau Bertha Ebenthal, and the police have been looking for her\\nfor some time. It is a valuable little present that I have made to\\nthem—to say nothing of Daniels! Ah, it was a clever plan, but he\\ndid not reckon on the cleverness of Hercule Poirot!”\\n\\nI think my friend might well be excused his moment of vanity.\\n\\n“When did you first begin to suspect the truth of the matter?”\\n\\n“When I began to work the right way—from _within_! I could not make\\nthat shooting affair fit in—but when I saw that the net result of\\nit was that _the Prime Minister went to France with his face bound\\nup_ I began to comprehend! And when I visited all the cottage\\nhospitals between Windsor and London, and found that no one\\nanswering to my description had had his face bound up and dressed\\nthat morning, I was sure! After that, it was child’s-play for a\\nmind like mine!”\\n\\n  •   •   •   •   •   •   •\\n\\nThe following morning, Poirot showed me a telegram he had just\\nreceived. It had no place of origin, and was unsigned. It ran:\\n\\n“In time.”\\n\\nLater in the day the evening papers published an account of the\\nAllied Conference. They laid particular stress on the magnificent\\novation accorded to Mr. David MacAdam, whose inspiring speech had\\nproduced a deep and lasting impression.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  IX\\n\\n\\n  The Disappearance of Mr. Davenheim\\n\\n\\nPoirot and I were expecting our old friend Inspector Japp of\\nScotland Yard to tea. We were sitting round the tea-table awaiting\\nhis arrival. Poirot had just finished carefully straightening the\\ncups and saucers which our landlady was in the habit of throwing,\\nrather than placing, on the table. He had also breathed heavily on\\nthe metal teapot, and polished it with a silk handkerchief. The\\nkettle was on the boil, and a small enamel saucepan beside it\\ncontained some thick, sweet chocolate which was more to Poirot’s\\npalate than what he described as “your English poison.” A sharp\\n“rat-tat” sounded below, and a few minutes afterwards Japp entered\\nbriskly.\\n\\n“Hope I’m not late,” he said as he greeted us. “To tell the truth,\\nI was yarning with Miller, the man who’s in charge of the Davenheim\\ncase.”\\n\\nI pricked up my ears. For the last three days the papers had been\\nfull of the strange disappearance of Mr. Davenheim, senior partner\\nof Davenheim and Salmon, the well-known bankers and financiers. On\\nSaturday last he had walked out of his house, and had never been\\nseen since. I looked forward to extracting some interesting details\\nfrom Japp.\\n\\n“I should have thought,” I remarked, “that it would be almost\\nimpossible for anyone to ‘disappear’ nowadays.”\\n\\nPoirot moved a plate of bread and butter the eighth of an inch,\\nand said sharply:\\n\\n“Be exact, my friend. What do you mean by ‘disappear’? To which\\nclass of disappearance are you referring?”\\n\\n“Are disappearances classified and labelled, then?” I laughed.\\n\\nJapp smiled also. Poirot frowned at us both.\\n\\n“But certainly they are! They fall into three categories: First,\\nand most common, the voluntary disappearance. Second, the much\\nabused ‘loss of memory’ case—rare, but occasionally genuine. Third,\\nmurder, and a more or less successful disposal of the body. Do you\\nrefer to all three as impossible of execution?”\\n\\n“Very nearly so, I should think. You might lose your own memory,\\nbut some one would be sure to recognize you—especially in the case\\nof a well-known man like Davenheim. Then ‘bodies’ can’t be made to\\nvanish into thin air. Sooner or later they turn up, concealed in\\nlonely places, or in trunks. Murder will out. In the same way, the\\nabsconding clerk, or the domestic defaulter, is bound to be run\\ndown in these days of wireless telegraphy. He can be headed off\\nfrom foreign countries; ports and railway stations are watched;\\nand, as for concealment in this country, his features and appearance\\nwill be known to every one who reads a daily newspaper. He’s up\\nagainst civilization.”\\n\\n“_Mon ami_,” said Poirot, “you make one error. You do not allow\\nfor the fact that a man who had decided to make away with another\\nman—or with himself in a figurative sense—might be that rare\\nmachine, a man of method. He might bring intelligence, talent, a\\ncareful calculation of detail to the task; and then I do not see\\nwhy he should not be successful in baffling the police force.”\\n\\n“But not _you_, I suppose?” said Japp good-humouredly, winking at\\nme. “He couldn’t baffle _you_, eh, Monsieur Poirot?”\\n\\nPoirot endeavoured, with a marked lack of success, to look modest.\\n“Me, also! Why not? It is true that I approach such problems with\\nan exact science, a mathematical precision, which seems, alas, only\\ntoo rare in the new generation of detectives!”\\n\\nJapp grinned more widely.\\n\\n“I don’t know,” he said. “Miller, the man who’s on this case, is\\na smart chap. You may be very sure he won’t overlook a footprint,\\nor a cigar-ash, or a crumb even. He’s got eyes that see everything.”\\n\\n“So, _mon ami_,” said Poirot, “has the London sparrow. But all the\\nsame, I should not ask the little brown bird to solve the problem\\nof Mr. Davenheim.”\\n\\n“Come now, monsieur, you’re not going to run down the value of\\ndetails as clues?”\\n\\n“By no means. These things are all good in their way. The danger\\nis they may assume undue importance. Most details are insignificant;\\none or two are vital. It is the brain, the little grey cells”—he\\ntapped his forehead—“on which one must rely. The senses mislead.\\nOne must seek the truth within—not without.”\\n\\n“You don’t mean to say, Monsieur Poirot, that you would undertake\\nto solve a case without moving from your chair, do you?”\\n\\n“That is exactly what I do mean—granted the facts were placed\\nbefore me. I regard myself as a consulting specialist.”\\n\\nJapp slapped his knee. “Hanged if I don’t take you at your word.\\nBet you a fiver that you can’t lay your hand—or rather tell me\\nwhere to lay my hand—on Mr. Davenheim, dead or alive, before a week\\nis out.”\\n\\nPoirot considered. “_Eh bien, mon ami_, I accept. _Le sport_, it\\nis the passion of you English. Now—the facts.”\\n\\n“On Saturday last, as is his usual custom, Mr. Davenheim took the\\n12.40 train from Victoria to Chingside, where his palatial country\\nplace, The Cedars, is situated. After lunch, he strolled round the\\ngrounds, and gave various directions to the gardeners. Everybody\\nagrees that his manner was absolutely normal and as usual. After\\ntea he put his head into his wife’s boudoir, saying that he was\\ngoing to stroll down to the village and post some letters. He added\\nthat he was expecting a Mr. Lowen, on business. If he should come\\nbefore he himself returned, he was to be shown into the study and\\nasked to wait. Mr. Davenheim then left the house by the front door,\\npassed leisurely down the drive, and out at the gate, and—was never\\nseen again. From that hour, he vanished completely.”\\n\\n“Pretty—very pretty—altogether a charming little problem,” murmured\\nPoirot. “Proceed, my good friend.”\\n\\n“About a quarter of an hour later a tall, dark man with a thick\\nblack moustache rang the front-door bell, and explained that he\\nhad an appointment with Mr. Davenheim. He gave the name of Lowen,\\nand in accordance with the banker’s instructions was shown into\\nthe study. Nearly an hour passed. Mr. Davenheim did not return.\\nFinally Mr. Lowen rang the bell, and explained that he was unable\\nto wait any longer, as he must catch his train back to town. Mrs.\\nDavenheim apologized for her husband’s absence, which seemed\\nunaccountable, as she knew him to have been expecting the visitor.\\nMr. Lowen reiterated his regrets and took his departure.\\n\\n“Well, as every one knows, Mr. Davenheim did not return. Early on\\nSunday morning the police were communicated with, but could make\\nneither head nor tail of the matter. Mr. Davenheim seemed literally\\nto have vanished into thin air. He had not been to the post office;\\nnor had he been seen passing through the village. At the station\\nthey were positive he had not departed by any train. His own motor\\nhad not left the garage. If he had hired a car to meet him in some\\nlonely spot, it seems almost certain that by this time, in view of\\nthe large reward offered for information, the driver of it would\\nhave come forward to tell what he knew. True, there was a small\\nrace-meeting at Entfield, five miles away, and if he had walked to\\nthat station he might have passed unnoticed in the crowd. But since\\nthen his photograph and a full description of him have been\\ncirculated in every newspaper, and nobody has been able to give\\nany news of him. We have, of course, received many letters from\\nall over England, but each clue, so far, has ended in disappointment.\\n\\n“On Monday morning a further sensational discovery came to light.\\nBehind a portière in Mr. Davenheim’s study stands a safe, and that\\nsafe had been broken into and rifled. The windows were fastened\\nsecurely on the inside, which seems to put an ordinary burglary\\nout of court, unless, of course, an accomplice within the house\\nfastened them again afterwards. On the other hand, Sunday having\\nintervened, and the household being in a state of chaos, it is\\nlikely that the burglary was committed on the Saturday, and remained\\nundetected until Monday.”\\n\\n“_Précisément_,” said Poirot dryly. “Well, is he arrested, _ce\\npauvre M. Lowen_?”\\n\\nJapp grinned. “Not yet. But he’s under pretty close supervision.”\\n\\nPoirot nodded. “What was taken from the safe? Have you any idea?”\\n\\n“We’ve been going into that with the junior partner of the firm\\nand Mrs. Davenheim. Apparently there was a considerable amount in\\nbearer bonds, and a very large sum in notes, owing to some large\\ntransaction having been just carried through. There was also a\\nsmall fortune in jewellery. All Mrs. Davenheim’s jewels were kept\\nin the safe. The purchasing of them had become a passion with her\\nhusband of late years, and hardly a month passed that he did not\\nmake her a present of some rare and costly gem.”\\n\\n“Altogether a good haul,” said Poirot thoughtfully. “Now, what\\nabout Lowen? Is it known what his business was with Davenheim that\\nevening?”\\n\\n“Well, the two men were apparently not on very good terms. Lowen\\nis a speculator in quite a small way. Nevertheless, he has been\\nable once or twice to score a _coup_ off Davenheim in the market,\\nthough it seems they seldom or never actually met. It was a matter\\nconcerning some South American shares which led the banker to make\\nhis appointment.”\\n\\n“Had Davenheim interests in South America, then?”\\n\\n“I believe so. Mrs. Davenheim happened to mention that he spent\\nall last autumn in Buenos Ayres.”\\n\\n“Any trouble in his home life? Were the husband and wife on good\\nterms?”\\n\\n“I should say his domestic life was quite peaceful and uneventful.\\nMrs. Davenheim is a pleasant, rather unintelligent woman. Quite a\\nnonentity, I think.”\\n\\n“Then we must not look for the solution of the mystery there. Had\\nhe any enemies?”\\n\\n“He had plenty of financial rivals, and no doubt there are many\\npeople whom he has got the better of who bear him no particular\\ngood-will. But there was no one likely to make away with him—and,\\nif they had, where is the body?”\\n\\n“Exactly. As Hastings says, bodies have a habit of coming to light\\nwith fatal persistency.”\\n\\n“By the way, one of the gardeners says he saw a figure going round\\nto the side of the house toward the rose-garden. The long French\\nwindow of the study opens on to the rose-garden, and Mr. Davenheim\\nfrequently entered and left the house that way. But the man was a\\ngood way off, at work on some cucumber frames, and cannot even say\\nwhether it was the figure of his master or not. Also, he cannot\\nfix the time with any accuracy. It must have been before six, as\\nthe gardeners cease work at that time.”\\n\\n“And Mr. Davenheim left the house?”\\n\\n“About half-past five or thereabouts.”\\n\\n“What lies beyond the rose-garden?”\\n\\n“A lake.”\\n\\n“With a boathouse?”\\n\\n“Yes, a couple of punts are kept there. I suppose you’re thinking\\nof suicide, Monsieur Poirot? Well, I don’t mind telling you that\\nMiller’s going down to-morrow expressly to see that piece of water\\ndragged. That’s the kind of man he is!”\\n\\nPoirot smiled faintly, and turned to me. “Hastings, I pray you,\\nhand me that copy of the _Daily Megaphone_. If I remember rightly,\\nthere is an unusually clear photograph there of the missing man.”\\n\\nI rose, and found the sheet required. Poirot studied the features\\nattentively.\\n\\n“H’m!” he murmured. “Wears his hair rather long and wavy, full\\nmoustache and pointed beard, bushy eyebrows. Eyes dark?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“Hair and beard turning grey?”\\n\\nThe detective nodded. “Well, Monsieur Poirot, what have you got to\\nsay to it all? Clear as daylight, eh?”\\n\\n“On the contrary, most obscure.”\\n\\nThe Scotland Yard man looked pleased.\\n\\n“Which gives me great hopes of solving it,” finished Poirot\\nplacidly.\\n\\n“Eh?”\\n\\n“I find it a good sign when a case is obscure. If a thing is clear\\nas daylight—_eh bien_, mistrust it! Some one has made it so.”\\n\\nJapp shook his head almost pityingly. “Well, each to their fancy.\\nBut it’s not a bad thing to see your way clear ahead.”\\n\\n“I do not see,” murmured Poirot. “I shut my eyes—and think.”\\n\\nJapp sighed. “Well, you’ve got a clear week to think in.”\\n\\n“And you will bring me any fresh developments that arise—the result\\nof the labours of the hard-working and lynx-eyed Inspector Miller,\\nfor instance?”\\n\\n“Certainly. That’s in the bargain.”\\n\\n“Seems a shame, doesn’t it?” said Japp to me as I accompanied him\\nto the door. “Like robbing a child!”\\n\\nI could not help agreeing with a smile. I was still smiling as I\\nre-entered the room.\\n\\n“_Eh bien!_” said Poirot immediately. “You make fun of Papa Poirot,\\nis it not so?” He shook his finger at me. “You do not trust his\\ngrey cells? Ah, do not be confused! Let us discuss this little\\nproblem—incomplete as yet, I admit, but already showing one or two\\npoints of interest.”\\n\\n“The lake!” I said significantly.\\n\\n“And even more than the lake, the boathouse!”\\n\\nI looked sidewise at Poirot. He was smiling in his most inscrutable\\nfashion. I felt that, for the moment, it would be quite useless to\\nquestion him further.\\n\\nWe heard nothing of Japp until the following evening, when he\\nwalked in about nine o’clock. I saw at once by his expression that\\nhe was bursting with news of some kind.\\n\\n“_Eh bien_, my friend,” remarked Poirot. “All goes well? But do\\nnot tell me that you have discovered the body of Mr. Davenheim in\\nyour lake, because I shall not believe you.”\\n\\n“We haven’t found the body, but we did find his _clothes_—the\\nidentical clothes he was wearing that day. What do you say to\\nthat?”\\n\\n“Any other clothes missing from the house?”\\n\\n“No, his valet is quite positive on that point. The rest of his\\nwardrobe is intact. There’s more. We’ve arrested Lowen. One of the\\nmaids, whose business it is to fasten the bedroom windows, declares\\nthat she saw Lowen coming _towards_ the study through the\\nrose-garden about a quarter past six. That would be about ten\\nminutes before he left the house.”\\n\\n“What does he himself say to that?”\\n\\n“Denied first of all that he had ever left the study. But the maid\\nwas positive, and he pretended afterwards that he had forgotten\\njust stepping out of the window to examine an unusual species of\\nrose. Rather a weak story! And there’s fresh evidence against him\\ncome to light. Mr. Davenheim always wore a thick gold ring set with\\na solitaire diamond on the little finger of his right hand. Well,\\nthat ring was pawned in London on Saturday night by a man called\\nBilly Kellett! He’s already known to the police—did three months\\nlast autumn for lifting an old gentleman’s watch. It seems he tried\\nto pawn the ring at no less than five different places, succeeded\\nat the last one, got gloriously drunk on the proceeds, assaulted\\na policeman, and was run in in consequence. I went to Bow Street\\nwith Miller and saw him. He’s sober enough now, and I don’t mind\\nadmitting we pretty well frightened the life out of him, hinting\\nhe might be charged with murder. This is his yarn, and a very queer\\none it is.\\n\\n“He was at Entfield races on Saturday, though I dare say scarfpins\\nwas his line of business, rather than betting. Anyway, he had a\\nbad day, and was down on his luck. He was tramping along the road\\nto Chingside, and sat down in a ditch to rest just before he got\\ninto the village. A few minutes later he noticed a man coming along\\nthe road to the village, ‘dark-complexioned gent, with a big\\nmoustache, one of them city toffs,’ is his description of the man.\\n\\n“Kellett was half concealed from the road by a heap of stones. Just\\nbefore he got abreast of him, the man looked quickly up and down\\nthe road, and seeing it apparently deserted he took a small object\\nfrom his pocket and threw it over the hedge. Then he went on\\ntowards the station. Now, the object he had thrown over the hedge\\nhad fallen with a slight ‘chink’ which aroused the curiosity of\\nthe human derelict in the ditch. He investigated and, after a short\\nsearch, discovered the ring! That is Kellett’s story. It’s only\\nfair to say that Lowen denies it utterly, and of course the word\\nof a man like Kellett can’t be relied upon in the slightest. It’s\\nwithin the bounds of possibility that he met Davenheim in the lane\\nand robbed and murdered him.”\\n\\nPoirot shook his head.\\n\\n“Very improbable, _mon ami_. He had no means of disposing of the\\nbody. It would have been found by now. Secondly, the open way in\\nwhich he pawned the ring makes it unlikely that he did murder to\\nget it. Thirdly, your sneak-thief is rarely a murderer. Fourthly,\\nas he has been in prison since Saturday, it would be too much of\\na coincidence that he is able to give so accurate a description of\\nLowen.”\\n\\nJapp nodded. “I don’t say you’re not right. But all the same, you\\nwon’t get a jury to take much note of a jailbird’s evidence. What\\nseems odd to me is that Lowen couldn’t find a cleverer way of\\ndisposing of the ring.”\\n\\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders. “Well, after all, if it were found\\nin the neighbourhood, it might be argued that Davenheim himself\\nhad dropped it.”\\n\\n“But why remove it from the body at all?” I cried.\\n\\n“There might be a reason for that,” said Japp. “Do you know that\\njust beyond the lake, a little gate leads out on to the hill, and\\nnot three minutes’ walk brings you to—what do you think?—a _lime\\nkiln_.”\\n\\n“Good heavens!” I cried. “You mean that the lime which destroyed\\nthe body would be powerless to affect the metal of the ring?”\\n\\n“Exactly.”\\n\\n“It seems to me,” I said, “that that explains everything. What a\\nhorrible crime!”\\n\\nBy common consent we both turned and looked at Poirot. He seemed\\nlost in reflection, his brow knitted, as though with some supreme\\nmental effort. I felt that at last his keen intellect was asserting\\nitself. What would his first words be? We were not long left in\\ndoubt. With a sigh, the tension of his attitude relaxed, and\\nturning to Japp, he asked:\\n\\n“Have you any idea, my friend, whether Mr. and Mrs. Davenheim\\noccupied the same bedroom?”\\n\\nThe question seemed so ludicrously inappropriate that for a moment\\nwe both stared in silence. Then Japp burst into a laugh. “Good\\nLord, Monsieur Poirot, I thought you were coming out with something\\nstartling. As to your question, I’m sure I don’t know.”\\n\\n“You could find out?” asked Poirot with curious persistence.\\n\\n“Oh, certainly—if you _really_ want to know.”\\n\\n“_Merci, mon ami_. I should be obliged if you would make a point\\nof it.”\\n\\nJapp stared at him a few minutes longer, but Poirot seemed to have\\nforgotten us both. The detective shook his head sadly at me, and\\nmurmuring, “Poor old fellow! War’s been too much for him!” gently\\nwithdrew from the room.\\n\\nAs Poirot still seemed sunk in a daydream, I took a sheet of paper,\\nand amused myself by scribbling notes upon it. My friend’s voice\\naroused me. He had come out of his reverie, and was looking brisk\\nand alert.\\n\\n“_Que faites vous là, mon ami?_”\\n\\n“I was jotting down what occurred to me as the main points of\\ninterest in this affair.”\\n\\n“You become methodical—at last!” said Poirot approvingly.\\n\\nI concealed my pleasure. “Shall I read them to you?”\\n\\n“By all means.”\\n\\nI cleared my throat.\\n\\n“‘One: All the evidence points to Lowen having been the man who\\nforced the safe.\\n\\n“‘Two: He had a grudge against Davenheim.\\n\\n“‘Three: He lied in his first statement that he had never left the\\nstudy.\\n\\n“‘Four: If you accept Billy Kellett’s story as true, Lowen is\\nunmistakably implicated.’”\\n\\nI paused. “Well?” I asked, for I felt that I had put my finger on\\nall the vital facts.\\n\\nPoirot looked at me pityingly, shaking his head very gently. “_Mon\\npauvre ami!_ But it is that you have not the gift! The important\\ndetail, you appreciate him never! Also, your reasoning is false.”\\n\\n“How?”\\n\\n“Let me take your four points.\\n\\n“One: Mr. Lowen could not possibly know that he would have the\\nchance to open the safe. He came for a business interview. He could\\nnot know beforehand that Mr. Davenheim would be absent posting a\\nletter, and that he would consequently be alone in the study!”\\n\\n“He might have seized his opportunity,” I suggested.\\n\\n“And the tools? City gentlemen do not carry round housebreaker’s\\ntools on the off chance! And one could not cut into that safe with\\na penknife, _bien entendu_!”\\n\\n“Well, what about Number Two?”\\n\\n“You say Lowen had a grudge against Mr. Davenheim. What you mean\\nis that he had once or twice got the better of him. And presumably\\nthose transactions were entered into with the view of benefiting\\nhimself. In any case you do not as a rule bear a grudge against a\\nman you have got the better of—it is more likely to be the other\\nway about. Whatever grudge there might have been would have been\\non Mr. Davenheim’s side.”\\n\\n“Well, you can’t deny that he lied about never having left the\\nstudy?”\\n\\n“No. But he may have been frightened. Remember, the missing man’s\\nclothes had just been discovered in the lake. Of course, as usual,\\nhe would have done better to speak the truth.”\\n\\n“And the fourth point?”\\n\\n“I grant you that. If Kellett’s story is true, Lowen is undeniably\\nimplicated. That is what makes the affair so very interesting.”\\n\\n“Then I did appreciate _one_ vital fact?”\\n\\n“Perhaps—but you have entirely overlooked the two most important\\npoints, the ones which undoubtedly hold the clue to the whole\\nmatter.”\\n\\n“And pray, what are they?”\\n\\n“One, the passion which has grown upon Mr. Davenheim in the last\\nfew years for buying jewellery. Two, his trip to Buenos Ayres last\\nautumn.”\\n\\n“Poirot, you are joking!”\\n\\n“I am most serious. Ah, sacred thunder, but I hope Japp will not\\nforget my little commission.”\\n\\nBut the detective, entering into the spirit of the joke, had\\nremembered it so well that a telegram was handed to Poirot about\\neleven o’clock the next day. At his request I opened it and read\\nit out:\\n\\n“‘Husband and wife have occupied separate rooms since last winter.’”\\n\\n“Aha!” cried Poirot. “And now we are in mid June! All is solved!”\\n\\nI stared at him.\\n\\n“You have no moneys in the bank of Davenheim and Salmon, _mon\\nami_?”\\n\\n“No,” I said, wondering. “Why?”\\n\\n“Because I should advise you to withdraw it—before it is too\\nlate.”\\n\\n“Why, what do you expect?”\\n\\n“I expect a big smash in a few days—perhaps sooner. Which reminds\\nme, we will return the compliment of a _dépêche_ to Japp. A pencil,\\nI pray you, and a form. _Voilà!_ ‘Advise you to withdraw any money\\ndeposited with firm in question.’ That will intrigue him, the good\\nJapp! His eyes will open wide—wide! He will not comprehend in the\\nslightest—until to-morrow, or the next day!”\\n\\nI remained sceptical, but the morrow forced me to render tribute\\nto my friend’s remarkable powers. In every paper was a huge headline\\ntelling of the sensational failure of the Davenheim bank. The\\ndisappearance of the famous financier took on a totally different\\naspect in the light of the revelation of the financial affairs of\\nthe bank.\\n\\nBefore we were half-way through breakfast, the door flew open and\\nJapp rushed in. In his left hand was a paper; in his right was\\nPoirot’s telegram, which he banged down on the table in front of\\nmy friend.\\n\\n“How did you know, Monsieur Poirot? How the blazes could you know?”\\n\\nPoirot smiled placidly at him. “Ah, _mon ami_, after your wire, it\\nwas a certainty! From the commencement, see you, it struck me that\\nthe safe burglary was somewhat remarkable. Jewels, ready money,\\nbearer bonds—all so conveniently arranged for—whom? Well, the good\\nMonsieur Davenheim was of those who ‘look after Number One’ as your\\nsaying goes! It seemed almost certain that it was arranged\\nfor—himself! Then his passion of late years for buying jewellery!\\nHow simple! The funds he embezzled, he converted into jewels, very\\nlikely replacing them in turn with paste duplicates, and so he put\\naway in a safe place, under another name, a considerable fortune\\nto be enjoyed all in good time when every one has been thrown off\\nthe track. His arrangements completed, he makes an appointment with\\nMr. Lowen (who has been imprudent enough in the past to cross the\\ngreat man once or twice), drills a hole in the safe, leaves orders\\nthat the guest is to be shown into the study, and walks out of the\\nhouse—where?” Poirot stopped, and stretched out his hand for\\nanother boiled egg. He frowned. “It is really insupportable,” he\\nmurmured, “that every hen lays an egg of a different size! What\\nsymmetry can there be on the breakfast table? At least they should\\nsort them in dozens at the shop!”\\n\\n“Never mind the eggs,” said Japp impatiently. “Let ’em lay ’em\\nsquare if they like. Tell us where our customer went to when he\\nleft The Cedars—that is, if you know!”\\n\\n“_Eh bien_, he went to his hiding-place. Ah, this Monsieur\\nDavenheim, there may be some malformation in his grey cells, but\\nthey are of the first quality!”\\n\\n“Do you know where he is hiding?”\\n\\n“Certainly! It is most ingenious.”\\n\\n“For the Lord’s sake, tell us, then!”\\n\\nPoirot gently collected every fragment of shell from his plate,\\nplaced them in the egg-cup, and reversed the empty egg-shell on\\ntop of them. This little operation concluded, he smiled on the neat\\neffect, and then beamed affectionately on us both.\\n\\n“Come, my friends, you are men of intelligence. Ask yourselves the\\nquestion which I asked myself. ‘If I were this man, where should\\n_I_ hide?’ Hastings, what do you say?”\\n\\n“Well,” I said, “I’m rather inclined to think I’d not do a bolt at\\nall. I’d stay in London—in the heart of things, travel by tubes\\nand buses; ten to one I’d never be recognized. There’s safety in\\na crowd.”\\n\\nPoirot turned inquiringly to Japp.\\n\\n“I don’t agree. Get clear away at once—that’s the only chance. I\\nwould have had plenty of time to prepare things beforehand. I’d\\nhave a yacht waiting, with steam up, and I’d be off to one of the\\nmost out-of-the-way corners of the world before the hue and cry\\nbegan!”\\n\\nWe both looked at Poirot. “What do _you_ say, monsieur?”\\n\\nFor a moment he remained silent. Then a very curious smile flitted\\nacross his face.\\n\\n“My friends, if _I_ were hiding from the police, do you know\\n_where_ I should hide? _In a prison!_”\\n\\n“_What?_”\\n\\n“You are seeking Monsieur Davenheim in order to put him in prison,\\nso you never dream of looking to see if he may not be already\\nthere!”\\n\\n“What do you mean?”\\n\\n“You tell me Madame Davenheim is not a very intelligent woman.\\nNevertheless I think that if you took her to Bow Street and\\nconfronted her with the man Billy Kellett, she would recognize him!\\nIn spite of the fact that he has shaved his beard and moustache\\nand those bushy eyebrows, and has cropped his hair close. A woman\\nnearly always knows her husband, though the rest of the world may\\nbe deceived!”\\n\\n“Billy Kellett? But he’s known to the police!”\\n\\n“Did I not tell you Davenheim was a clever man? He prepared his\\nalibi long beforehand. He was not in Buenos Ayres last autumn—he\\nwas creating the character of Billy Kellett, ‘doing three months,’\\nso that the police should have no suspicions when the time came.\\nHe was playing, remember, for a large fortune, as well as liberty.\\nIt was worth while doing the thing thoroughly. Only——”\\n\\n“Yes?”\\n\\n“_Eh bien_, afterwards he had to wear a false beard and wig, had\\nto _make up as himself_ again, and to sleep with a false beard is\\nnot easy—it invites detection! He cannot risk continuing to share\\nthe chamber of madame his wife. You found out for me that for the\\nlast six months, or ever since his supposed return from Buenos\\nAyres, he and Mrs. Davenheim occupied separate rooms. Then I was\\nsure! Everything fitted in. The gardener who fancied he saw his\\nmaster going round to the side of the house was quite right. He\\nwent to the boathouse, donned his ‘tramp’ clothes, which you may\\nbe sure had been safely hidden from the eyes of his valet, dropped\\nthe others in the lake, and proceeded to carry out his plan by\\npawning the ring in an obvious manner, and then assaulting a\\npoliceman, getting himself safely into the haven of Bow Street,\\nwhere nobody would ever dream of looking for him!”\\n\\n“It’s impossible,” murmured Japp.\\n\\n“Ask Madame,” said my friend, smiling.\\n\\nThe next day a registered letter lay beside Poirot’s plate. He\\nopened it, and a five-pound note fluttered out. My friend’s brow\\npuckered.\\n\\n“_Ah, sacré!_ But what shall I do with it? I have much remorse!\\n_Ce pauvre Japp_! Ah, an idea! We will have a little dinner, we\\nthree! That consoles me. It was really too easy. I am ashamed. I,\\nwho would not rob a child—_mille tonnerres! Mon ami_, what have\\nyou, that you laugh so heartily?”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  X\\n\\n\\n  The Adventure of the Italian Nobleman\\n\\n\\nPoirot and I had many friends and acquaintances of an informal\\nnature. Amongst these was to be numbered Dr. Hawker, a near\\nneighbour of ours, and a member of the medical profession. It was\\nthe genial doctor’s habit to drop in sometimes of an evening and\\nhave a chat with Poirot, of whose genius he was an ardent admirer.\\nThe doctor himself, frank and unsuspicious to the last degree,\\nadmired the talents so far removed from his own.\\n\\nOn one particular evening in early June, he arrived about half-past\\neight and settled down to a comfortable discussion on the cheery\\ntopic of the prevalence of arsenical poisoning in crimes. It must\\nhave been about a quarter of an hour later when the door of our\\nsitting-room flew open, and a distracted female precipitated\\nherself into the room.\\n\\n“Oh, doctor, you’re wanted! Such a terrible voice. It gave me a\\nturn, it did indeed.”\\n\\nI recognized in our new visitor Dr. Hawker’s housekeeper, Miss\\nRider. The doctor was a bachelor, and lived in a gloomy old house\\na few streets away. The usually placid Miss Rider was now in a\\nstate bordering on incoherence.\\n\\n“What terrible voice? Who is it, and what’s the trouble?”\\n\\n“It was the telephone, doctor. I answered it—and a voice spoke.\\n‘Help,’ it said. ‘Doctor—help. They’ve killed me!’ Then it sort of\\ntailed away. ‘Who’s speaking?’ I said. ‘Who’s speaking?’ Then I\\ngot a reply, just a whisper, it seemed, ‘Foscatine’—something like\\nthat—‘Regent’s Court.’”\\n\\nThe doctor uttered an exclamation.\\n\\n“Count Foscatini. He has a flat in Regent’s Court. I must go at\\nonce. What can have happened?”\\n\\n“A patient of yours?” asked Poirot.\\n\\n“I attended him for some slight ailment a few weeks ago. An Italian,\\nbut he speaks English perfectly. Well, I must wish you good night,\\nMonsieur Poirot, unless——” He hesitated.\\n\\n“I perceive the thought in your mind,” said Poirot, smiling. “I\\nshall be delighted to accompany you. Hastings, run down and get\\nhold of a taxi.”\\n\\nTaxis always make themselves sought for when one is particularly\\npressed for time, but I captured one at last, and we were soon\\nbowling along in the direction of Regent’s Park. Regent’s Court\\nwas a new block of flats, situated just off St. John’s Wood Road.\\nThey had only recently been built, and contained the latest service\\ndevices.\\n\\nThere was no one in the hall. The doctor pressed the lift-bell\\nimpatiently, and when the lift arrived questioned the uniformed\\nattendant sharply.\\n\\n“Flat II. Count Foscatini. There’s been an accident there, I\\nunderstand.”\\n\\nThe man stared at him.\\n\\n“First I’ve heard of it. Mr. Graves—that’s Count Foscatini’s\\nman—went out about half an hour ago, and he said nothing.”\\n\\n“Is the Count alone in the flat?”\\n\\n“No, sir, he’s got two gentlemen dining with him.”\\n\\n“What are they like?” I asked eagerly.\\n\\nWe were in the lift now, ascending rapidly to the second floor, on\\nwhich Flat II was situated.\\n\\n“I didn’t see them myself, sir, but I understand that they were\\nforeign gentlemen.”\\n\\nHe pulled back the iron door, and we stepped out on the landing.\\nNo. II was opposite to us. The doctor rang the bell. There was no\\nreply, and we could hear no sound from within. The doctor rang\\nagain and again; we could hear the bell trilling within, but no\\nsign of life rewarded us.\\n\\n“This is getting serious,” muttered the doctor. He turned to the\\nlift attendant.\\n\\n“Is there any pass-key to this door?”\\n\\n“There is one in the porter’s office downstairs.”\\n\\n“Get it, then, and, look here, I think you’d better send for the\\npolice.”\\n\\nPoirot approved with a nod of the head.\\n\\nThe man returned shortly; with him came the manager.\\n\\n“Will you tell me, gentlemen, what is the meaning of all this?”\\n\\n“Certainly. I received a telephone message from Count Foscatini\\nstating that he had been attacked and was dying. You can understand\\nthat we must lose no time—if we are not already too late.”\\n\\nThe manager produced the key without more ado, and we all entered\\nthe flat.\\n\\nWe passed first into a small square lounge hall. A door on the\\nright of it was half open. The manager indicated it with a nod.\\n\\n“The dining-room.”\\n\\nDr. Hawker led the way. We followed close on his heels. As we\\nentered the room I gave a gasp. The round table in the centre bore\\nthe remains of a meal; three chairs were pushed back, as though\\ntheir occupants had just risen. In the corner, to the right of the\\nfire-place, was a big writing-table, and sitting at it was a man—or\\nwhat had been a man. His right hand still grasped the base of the\\ntelephone, but he had fallen forward, struck down by a terrific\\nblow on the head from behind. The weapon was not far to seek. A\\nmarble statuette stood where it had been hurriedly put down, the\\nbase of it stained with blood.\\n\\nThe doctor’s examination did not take a minute. “Stone dead. Must\\nhave been almost instantaneous. I wonder he even managed to\\ntelephone. It will be better not to move him until the police\\narrive.”\\n\\nOn the manager’s suggestion we searched the flat, but the result\\nwas a foregone conclusion. It was not likely that the murderers\\nwould be concealed there when all they had to do was to walk out.\\n\\nWe came back to the dining-room. Poirot had not accompanied us in\\nour tour. I found him studying the centre table with close\\nattention. I joined him. It was a well-polished round mahogany\\ntable. A bowl of roses decorated the centre, and white lace mats\\nreposed on the gleaming surface. There was a dish of fruit, but\\nthe three dessert plates were untouched. There were three\\ncoffee-cups with remains of coffee in them—two black, one with\\nmilk. All three men had taken port, and the decanter, half-full,\\nstood before the centre plate. One of the men had smoked a cigar,\\nthe other two cigarettes. A tortoiseshell-and-silver box, holding\\ncigars and cigarettes, stood open upon the table.\\n\\nI enumerated all these facts to myself, but I was forced to admit\\nthat they did not shed any brilliant light on the situation. I\\nwondered what Poirot saw in them to make him so intent. I asked\\nhim.\\n\\n“_Mon ami_,” he replied, “you miss the point. I am looking for\\nsomething that I do _not_ see.”\\n\\n“What is that?”\\n\\n“A mistake—even a little mistake—on the part of the murderer.”\\n\\nHe stepped swiftly to the small adjoining kitchen, looked in, and\\nshook his head.\\n\\n“Monsieur,” he said to the manager, “explain to me, I pray, your\\nsystem of serving meals here.”\\n\\nThe manager stepped to a small hatch in the wall.\\n\\n“This is the service lift,” he explained. “It runs to the kitchens\\nat the top of the building. You order through this telephone, and\\nthe dishes are sent down in the lift, one course at a time. The\\ndirty plates and dishes are sent up in the same manner. No domestic\\nworries, you understand, and at the same time you avoid the wearying\\npublicity of always dining in a restaurant.”\\n\\nPoirot nodded.\\n\\n“Then the plates and dishes that were used to-night are on high in\\nthe kitchen. You permit that I mount there?”\\n\\n“Oh, certainly, if you like! Roberts, the lift man, will take you\\nup and introduce you; but I’m afraid you won’t find anything that’s\\nof any use. They’re handling hundreds of plates and dishes, and\\nthey’ll be all lumped together.”\\n\\nPoirot remained firm, however, and together we visited the kitchens\\nand questioned the man who had taken the order from Flat II.\\n\\n“The order was given from the _à la carte menu_—for three,” he\\nexplained. “Soup julienne, filet de sole normande, tournedos of\\nbeef, and a rice soufflé. What time? Just about eight o’clock, I\\nshould say. No, I’m afraid the plates and dishes have been all\\nwashed up by now. Unfortunate. You were thinking of finger-prints,\\nI suppose?”\\n\\n“Not exactly,” said Poirot, with an enigmatical smile. “I am more\\ninterested in Count Foscatini’s appetite. Did he partake of every\\ndish?”\\n\\n“Yes; but of course I can’t say how much of each he ate. The plates\\nwere all soiled, and the dishes empty—that is to say, with the\\nexception of the rice soufflé. There was a fair amount of that\\nleft.”\\n\\n“Ah!” said Poirot, and seemed satisfied with the fact.\\n\\nAs we descended to the flat again he remarked in a low tone:\\n\\n“We have decidedly to do with a man of method.”\\n\\n“Do you mean the murderer, or Count Foscatini?”\\n\\n“The latter was undoubtedly an orderly gentleman. After imploring\\nhelp and announcing his approaching demise, he carefully hung up\\nthe telephone receiver.”\\n\\nI stared at Poirot. His words now and his recent inquiries gave me\\nthe glimmering of an idea.\\n\\n“You suspect poison?” I breathed. “The blow on the head was a\\nblind.”\\n\\nPoirot merely smiled.\\n\\nWe re-entered the flat to find the local inspector of police had\\narrived with two constables. He was inclined to resent our\\nappearance, but Poirot calmed him with the mention of our Scotland\\nYard friend, Inspector Japp, and we were accorded a grudging\\npermission to remain. It was a lucky thing we were, for we had not\\nbeen back five minutes before an agitated middle-aged man came\\nrushing into the room with every appearance of grief and agitation.\\n\\nThis was Graves, valet-butler to the late Count Foscatini. The\\nstory he had to tell was a sensational one.\\n\\nOn the previous morning, two gentlemen had called to see his\\nmaster. They were Italians, and the elder of the two, a man of\\nabout forty, gave his name as Signor Ascanio. The younger was a\\nwell-dressed lad of about twenty-four.\\n\\nCount Foscatini was evidently prepared for their visit and\\nimmediately sent Graves out upon some trivial errand. Here the man\\npaused and hesitated in his story. In the end, however, he admitted\\nthat, curious as to the purport of the interview, he had not obeyed\\nimmediately, but had lingered about endeavouring to hear something\\nof what was going on.\\n\\nThe conversation was carried on in so low a tone that he was not\\nas successful as he had hoped; but he gathered enough to make it\\nclear that some kind of monetary proposition was being discussed,\\nand that the basis of it was a threat. The discussion was anything\\nbut amicable. In the end, Count Foscatini raised his voice slightly,\\nand the listener heard these words clearly:\\n\\n“I have no time to argue further now, gentlemen. If you will dine\\nwith me to-morrow night at eight o’clock, we will resume the\\ndiscussion.”\\n\\nAfraid of being discovered listening, Graves had then hurried out\\nto do his master’s errand. This evening the two men had arrived\\npunctually at eight. During dinner they had talked of indifferent\\nmatters—politics, the weather, and the theatrical world. When\\nGraves had placed the port upon the table and brought in the coffee\\nhis master told him that he might have the evening off.\\n\\n“Was that a usual proceeding of his when he had guests?” asked the\\ninspector.\\n\\n“No, sir; it wasn’t. That’s what made me think it must be some\\nbusiness of a very unusual kind that he was going to discuss with\\nthese gentlemen.”\\n\\nThat finished Graves’s story. He had gone out about 8.30, and,\\nmeeting a friend, had accompanied him to the Metropolitan Music\\nHall in Edgware Road.\\n\\nNobody had seen the two men leave, but the time of the murder was\\nfixed clearly enough at 8.47. A small clock on the writing-table\\nhad been swept off by Foscatini’s arm, and had stopped at that\\nhour, which agreed with Miss Rider’s telephone summons.\\n\\nThe police surgeon had made his examination of the body, and it\\nwas now lying on the couch. I saw the face for the first time—the\\nolive complexion, the long nose, the luxuriant black moustache,\\nand the full red lips drawn back from the dazzlingly white teeth.\\nNot altogether a pleasant face.\\n\\n“Well,” said the inspector, refastening his notebook. “The case\\nseems clear enough. The only difficulty will be to lay our hands\\non this Signor Ascanio. I suppose his address is not in the dead\\nman’s pocket-book by any chance?”\\n\\nAs Poirot had said, the late Foscatini was an orderly man. Neatly\\nwritten in small, precise handwriting was the inscription, “Signor\\nPaolo Ascanio, Grosvenor Hotel.”\\n\\nThe inspector busied himself with the telephone, then turned to us\\nwith a grin.\\n\\n“Just in time. Our fine gentleman was off to catch the boat train\\nto the Continong. Well, gentlemen, that’s about all we can do here.\\nIt’s a bad business, but straightforward enough. One of these\\nItalian vendetta things, as likely as not.”\\n\\nThus airily dismissed, we found our way downstairs. Dr. Hawker was\\nfull of excitement.\\n\\n“Like the beginning of a novel, eh? Real exciting stuff. Wouldn’t\\nbelieve it if you read about it.”\\n\\nPoirot did not speak. He was very thoughtful. All the evening he\\nhad hardly opened his lips.\\n\\n“What says the master detective, eh?” asked Hawker, clapping him\\non the back. “Nothing to work your grey cells over this time.”\\n\\n“You think not?”\\n\\n“What could there be?”\\n\\n“Well, for example, there is the window.”\\n\\n“The window? But it was fastened. Nobody could have got out or in\\nthat way. I noticed it specially.”\\n\\n“And why were you able to notice it?”\\n\\nThe doctor looked puzzled. Poirot hastened to explain.\\n\\n“It is to the curtains I refer. They were not drawn. A little odd,\\nthat. And then there was the coffee. It was very black coffee.”\\n\\n“Well, what of it?”\\n\\n“Very black,” repeated Poirot. “In conjunction with that let us\\nremember that very little of the rice soufflé was eaten, and we\\nget—what?”\\n\\n“Moonshine,” laughed the doctor. “You’re pulling my leg.”\\n\\n“Never do I pull the leg. Hastings here knows that I am perfectly\\nserious.”\\n\\n“I don’t know what you are getting at, all the same,” I confessed.\\n“You don’t suspect the manservant, do you? He might have been in\\nwith the gang, and put some dope in the coffee. I suppose they’ll\\ntest his alibi?”\\n\\n“Without doubt, my friend; but it is the alibi of Signor Ascanio\\nthat interests me.”\\n\\n“You think he has an alibi?”\\n\\n“That is just what worries me. I have no doubt that we shall soon\\nbe enlightened on that point.”\\n\\nThe _Daily Newsmonger_ enabled us to become conversant with\\nsucceeding events.\\n\\nSignor Ascanio was arrested and charged with the murder of Count\\nFoscatini. When arrested, he denied knowing the Count, and declared\\nhe had never been near Regent’s Court either on the evening of the\\ncrime or on the previous morning. The younger man had disappeared\\nentirely. Signor Ascanio had arrived alone at the Grosvenor Hotel\\nfrom the Continent two days before the murder. All efforts to trace\\nthe second man failed.\\n\\nAscanio, however, was not sent for trial. No less a personage than\\nthe Italian Ambassador himself came forward and testified at the\\npolice-court proceedings that Ascanio had been with him at the\\nEmbassy from eight till nine that evening. The prisoner was\\ndischarged. Naturally, a lot of people thought that the crime was\\na political one, and was being deliberately hushed up.\\n\\nPoirot had taken a keen interest in all these points. Nevertheless,\\nI was somewhat surprised when he suddenly informed me one morning\\nthat he was expecting a visitor at eleven o’clock, and that that\\nvisitor was none other than Ascanio himself.\\n\\n“He wishes to consult you?”\\n\\n“_Du tout_, Hastings. I wish to consult him.”\\n\\n“What about?”\\n\\n“The Regent’s Court murder.”\\n\\n“You are going to prove that he did it?”\\n\\n“A man cannot be tried twice for murder, Hastings. Endeavour to\\nhave the common sense. Ah, that is our friend’s ring.”\\n\\nA few minutes later Signor Ascanio was ushered in—a small, thin\\nman with a secretive and furtive glance in his eyes. He remained\\nstanding, darting suspicious glances from one to the other of us.\\n\\n“Monsieur Poirot?”\\n\\nMy little friend tapped himself gently on the chest.\\n\\n“Be seated, signor. You received my note. I am determined to get\\nto the bottom of this mystery. In some small measure you can aid\\nme. Let us commence. You—in company with a friend—visited the late\\nCount Foscatini on the morning of Tuesday the 9th——”\\n\\nThe Italian made an angry gesture.\\n\\n“I did nothing of the sort. I have sworn in court——”\\n\\n“_Précisément_—and I have a little idea that you have sworn\\nfalsely.”\\n\\n“You threaten me? Bah! I have nothing to fear from you. I have been\\nacquitted.”\\n\\n“Exactly; and as I am not an imbecile, it is not with the gallows\\nI threaten you—but with publicity. Publicity! I see that you do\\nnot like the word. I had an idea that you would not. My little\\nideas, you know, they are very valuable to me. Come, signor, your\\nonly chance is to be frank with me. I do not ask to know whose\\nindiscretions brought you to England. I know this much, you came\\nfor the especial purpose of seeing Count Foscatini.”\\n\\n“He was not a count,” growled the Italian.\\n\\n“I have already noted the fact that his name does not appear in\\nthe _Almanach de Gotha_. Never mind, the title of count is often\\nuseful in the profession of blackmailing.”\\n\\n“I suppose I might as well be frank. You seem to know a good deal.”\\n\\n“I have employed my grey cells to some advantage. Come, Signor\\nAscanio, you visited the dead man on the Tuesday morning—that is\\nso, is it not?”\\n\\n“Yes; but I never went there on the following evening. There was\\nno need. I will tell you all. Certain information concerning a man\\nof great position in Italy had come into this scoundrel’s\\npossession. He demanded a big sum of money in return for the\\npapers. I came over to England to arrange the matter. I called upon\\nhim by appointment that morning. One of the young secretaries of\\nthe Embassy was with me. The Count was more reasonable than I had\\nhoped, although even then the sum of money I paid him was a huge\\none.”\\n\\n“Pardon, how was it paid?”\\n\\n“In Italian notes of comparatively small denomination. I paid over\\nthe money then and there. He handed me the incriminating papers.\\nI never saw him again.”\\n\\n“Why did you not say all this when you were arrested?”\\n\\n“In my delicate position I was forced to deny any association with\\nthe man.”\\n\\n“And how do you account for the events of the evening, then?”\\n\\n“I can only think that some one must have deliberately impersonated\\nme. I understand that no money was found in the flat.”\\n\\nPoirot looked at him and shook his head.\\n\\n“Strange,” he murmured. “We all have the little grey cells. And so\\nfew of us know how to use them. Good morning, Signor Ascanio. I\\nbelieve your story. It is very much as I had imagined. But I had\\nto make sure.”\\n\\nAfter bowing his guest out, Poirot returned to his arm-chair and\\nsmiled at me.\\n\\n“Let us hear M. le Capitaine Hastings on the case?”\\n\\n“Well, I suppose Ascanio is right—somebody impersonated him.”\\n\\n“Never, never will you use the brains the good God has given you.\\nRecall to yourself some words I uttered after leaving the flat that\\nnight. I referred to the window-curtains not being drawn. We are\\nin the month of June. It is still light at eight o’clock. The light\\nis failing by half-past. _Ça vous dit quelque chose?_ I perceive\\na struggling impression that you will arrive some day. Now let us\\ncontinue. The coffee was, as I said, very black. Count Foscatini’s\\nteeth were magnificently white. Coffee stains the teeth. We reason\\nfrom that that Count Foscatini did not drink any coffee. Yet there\\nwas coffee in all three cups. Why should anyone pretend Count\\nFoscatini had drunk coffee when he had not done so?”\\n\\nI shook my head, utterly bewildered.\\n\\n“Come, I will help you. What evidence have we that Ascanio and his\\nfriend, or two men posing as them, ever came to the flat that\\nnight? Nobody saw them go in; nobody saw them go out. We have the\\nevidence of one man and of a host of inanimate objects.”\\n\\n“You mean?”\\n\\n“I mean knives and forks and plates and empty dishes. Ah, but it\\nwas a clever idea! Graves is a thief and a scoundrel, but what a\\nman of method! He overhears a portion of the conversation in the\\nmorning, enough to realize that Ascanio will be in awkward position\\nto defend himself. The following evening, about eight o’clock, he\\ntells his master he is wanted at the telephone. Foscatini sits\\ndown, stretches out his hand to the telephone, and from behind\\nGraves strikes him down with the marble figure. Then quickly to\\nthe service telephone—dinner for three! It comes, he lays the\\ntable, dirties the plates, knives, and forks, etc. But he has to\\nget rid of the food too. Not only is he a man of brain; he has a\\nresolute and capacious stomach! But after eating three tournedos,\\nthe rice soufflé is too much for him! He even smokes a cigar and\\ntwo cigarettes to carry out the illusion. Ah, but it was\\nmagnificently thorough! Then, having moved on the hands of the\\nclock to 8.47, he smashes it and stops it. The one thing he does\\nnot do is to draw the curtains. But if there had been a real dinner\\nparty the curtains would have been drawn as soon as the light began\\nto fail. Then he hurries out, mentioning the guests to the lift\\nman in passing. He hurries to a telephone box, and as near as\\npossible to 8.47 rings up the doctor with his master’s dying cry.\\nSo successful is his idea that no one ever inquires if a call was\\nput through from Flat II at that time.”\\n\\n“Except Hercule Poirot, I suppose?” I said sarcastically.\\n\\n“Not even Hercule Poirot,” said my friend, with a smile. “I am\\nabout to inquire now. I had to prove my point to you first. But\\nyou will see, I shall be right; and then Japp, to whom I have\\nalready given a hint, will be able to arrest the respectable\\nGraves. I wonder how much of the money he has spent.”\\n\\nPoirot _was_ right. He always is, confound him!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  XI\\n\\n\\n  The Case of the Missing Will\\n\\n\\nThe problem presented to us by Miss Violet Marsh made rather a\\npleasant change from our usual routine work. Poirot had received\\na brisk and business-like note from the lady asking for an\\nappointment, and he had replied asking her to call upon him at\\neleven o’clock the following day.\\n\\nShe arrived punctually—a tall, handsome young woman, plainly but\\nneatly dressed, with an assured and business-like manner. Clearly\\na young woman who meant to get on in the world. I am not a great\\nadmirer of the so-called New Woman myself, and, in spite of her\\ngood looks, I was not particularly prepossessed in her favour.\\n\\n“My business is of a somewhat unusual nature, Monsieur Poirot,”\\nshe began, after she had accepted a chair. “I had better begin at\\nthe beginning and tell you the whole story.”\\n\\n“If you please, mademoiselle.”\\n\\n“I am an orphan. My father was one of two brothers, sons of a small\\nyeoman farmer in Devonshire. The farm was a poor one, and the elder\\nbrother, Andrew, emigrated to Australia, where he did very well\\nindeed, and by means of successful speculation in land became a\\nvery rich man. The younger brother, Roger (my father), had no\\nleanings towards the agricultural life. He managed to educate\\nhimself a little, and obtained a post as a clerk with a small firm.\\nHe married slightly above him; my mother was the daughter of a poor\\nartist. My father died when I was six years old. When I was\\nfourteen, my mother followed him to the grave. My only living\\nrelation then was my Uncle Andrew, who had recently returned from\\nAustralia and bought a small place, Crabtree Manor, in his native\\ncounty. He was exceedingly kind to his brother’s orphan child, took\\nme to live with him, and treated me in every way as though I was\\nhis own daughter.\\n\\n“Crabtree Manor, in spite of its name, is really only an old\\nfarmhouse. Farming was in my uncle’s blood, and he was intensely\\ninterested in various modern farming experiments. Although kindness\\nitself to me, he had certain peculiar and deeply-rooted ideas as\\nto the up-bringing of women. Himself a man of little or no\\neducation, though possessing remarkable shrewdness, he placed\\nlittle value on what he called ‘book knowledge.’ He was especially\\nopposed to the education of women. In his opinion, girls should\\nlearn practical housework and dairy-work, be useful about the home,\\nand have as little to do with book learning as possible. He proposed\\nto bring me up on these lines, to my bitter disappointment and\\nannoyance. I rebelled frankly. I knew that I possessed a good\\nbrain, and had absolutely no talent for domestic duties. My uncle\\nand I had many bitter arguments on the subject, for, though much\\nattached to each other, we were both self-willed. I was lucky\\nenough to win a scholarship, and up to a certain point was\\nsuccessful in getting my own way. The crisis arose when I resolved\\nto go to Girton. I had a little money of my own, left me by my\\nmother, and I was quite determined to make the best use of the\\ngifts God had given me. I had one long, final argument with my\\nuncle. He put the facts plainly before me. He had no other\\nrelations, and he had intended me to be his sole heiress. As I have\\ntold you, he was a very rich man. If I persisted in these\\n‘new-fangled notions’ of mine, however, I need look for nothing\\nfrom him. I remained polite, but firm. I should always be deeply\\nattached to him, I told him, but I must lead my own life. We parted\\non that note. ‘You fancy your brains, my girl,’ were his last\\nwords. ‘I’ve no book learning, but, for all that, I’ll pit mine\\nagainst yours any day. We’ll see what we shall see.’\\n\\n“That was nine years ago. I have stayed with him for a week-end\\noccasionally, and our relations were perfectly amicable, though\\nhis views remained unaltered. He never referred to my having\\nmatriculated, nor to my B.Sc. For the last three years his health\\nhad been failing, and a month ago he died.\\n\\n“I am now coming to the point of my visit. My uncle left a most\\nextraordinary will. By its terms, Crabtree Manor and its contents\\nare to be at my disposal for a year from his death—‘during which\\ntime my clever niece may prove her wits,’ the actual words run. At\\nthe end of that period, ‘my wits having proved better than hers,’\\nthe house and all my uncle’s large fortune pass to various\\ncharitable institutions.”\\n\\n“That is a little hard on you, mademoiselle, seeing that you were\\nMr. Marsh’s only blood relation.”\\n\\n“I do not look on it in that way. Uncle Andrew warned me fairly,\\nand I chose my own path. Since I would not fall in with his wishes,\\nhe was at perfect liberty to leave his money to whom he pleased.”\\n\\n“Was the will drawn up by a lawyer?”\\n\\n“No; it was written on a printed will-form and witnessed by the\\nman and his wife who live in the house and do for my uncle.”\\n\\n“There might be a possibility of upsetting such a will?”\\n\\n“I would not even attempt to do such a thing.”\\n\\n“You regard it, then, as a sporting challenge on the part of your\\nuncle?”\\n\\n“That is exactly how I look upon it.”\\n\\n“It bears that interpretation, certainly,” said Poirot thoughtfully.\\n“Somewhere in this rambling old manor-house your uncle has concealed\\neither a sum of money in notes or possibly a second will, and has\\ngiven you a year in which to exercise your ingenuity to find it.”\\n\\n“Exactly, Monsieur Poirot; and I am paying you the compliment of\\nassuming that your ingenuity will be greater than mine.”\\n\\n“Eh, eh! but that is very charming of you. My grey cells are at\\nyour disposal. You have made no search yourself?”\\n\\n“Only a cursory one; but I have too much respect for my uncle’s\\nundoubted abilities to fancy that the task will be an easy one.”\\n\\n“Have you the will or a copy of it with you?”\\n\\nMiss Marsh handed a document across the table. Poirot ran through\\nit, nodding to himself.\\n\\n“Made three years ago. Dated March 25; and the time is given\\nalso—11 a.m.—that is very suggestive. It narrows the field of\\nsearch. Assuredly it is another will we have to seek for. A will\\nmade even half-an-hour later would upset this. _Eh bien_,\\nmademoiselle, it is a problem charming and ingenious that you have\\npresented to me here. I shall have all the pleasure in the world\\nin solving it for you. Granted that your uncle was a man of ability,\\nhis grey cells cannot have been of the quality of Hercule Poirot’s!”\\n\\n(Really, Poirot’s vanity is blatant!)\\n\\n“Fortunately, I have nothing of moment on hand at the minute.\\nHastings and I will go down to Crabtree Manor to-night. The man\\nand wife who attended on your uncle are still there, I presume?”\\n\\n“Yes, their name is Baker.”\\n\\n\\n  •   •   •   •   •   •   •\\n\\n\\nThe following morning saw us started on the hunt proper. We had\\narrived late the night before. Mr. and Mrs. Baker, having received\\na telegram from Miss Marsh, were expecting us. They were a pleasant\\ncouple, the man gnarled and pink-cheeked, like a shrivelled pippin,\\nand his wife a woman of vast proportions and true Devonshire calm.\\n\\nTired with our journey and the eight-mile drive from the station,\\nwe had retired at once to bed after a supper of roast chicken,\\napple pie, and Devonshire cream. We had now disposed of an excellent\\nbreakfast, and were sitting in a small panelled room which had been\\nthe late Mr. Marsh’s study and living-room. A roll-top desk stuffed\\nwith papers, all neatly docketed, stood against the wall, and a\\nbig leather armchair showed plainly that it had been its owner’s\\nconstant resting-place. A big chintz-covered settee ran along the\\nopposite wall, and the deep low window seats were covered with the\\nsame faded chintz of an old-fashioned pattern.\\n\\n“_Eh bien, mon ami_,” said Poirot, lighting one of his tiny\\ncigarettes, “we must map out our plan of campaign. Already I have\\nmade a rough survey of the house, but I am of opinion that any clue\\nwill be found in this room. We shall have to go through the\\ndocuments in the desk with meticulous care. Naturally, I do not\\nexpect to find the will amongst them; but it is likely that some\\napparently innocent paper may conceal the clue to its hiding-place.\\nBut first we must have a little information. Ring the bell, I pray\\nof you.”\\n\\nI did so. While we were waiting for it to be answered, Poirot\\nwalked up and down, looking about him approvingly.\\n\\n“A man of method this Mr. Marsh. See how neatly the packets of\\npapers are docketed; then the key to each drawer has its ivory\\nlabel—so has the key of the china cabinet on the wall; and see\\nwith what precision the china within is arranged. It rejoices the\\nheart. Nothing here offends the eye——”\\n\\nHe came to an abrupt pause, as his eye was caught by the key of\\nthe desk itself, to which a dirty envelope was affixed. Poirot\\nfrowned at it and withdrew it from the lock. On it were scrawled\\nthe words: “Key of Roll Top Desk,” in a crabbed handwriting, quite\\nunlike the neat superscriptions on the other keys.\\n\\n“An alien note,” said Poirot, frowning. “I could swear that here\\nwe have no longer the personality of Mr. Marsh. But who else has\\nbeen in the house? Only Miss Marsh, and she, if I mistake not, is\\nalso a young lady of method and order.”\\n\\nBaker came in answer to the bell.\\n\\n“Will you fetch madame your wife, and answer a few questions?”\\n\\nBaker departed, and in a few moments returned with Mrs. Baker,\\nwiping her hands on her apron and beaming all over her face.\\n\\nIn a few clear words Poirot set forth the object of his mission.\\nThe Bakers were immediately sympathetic.\\n\\n“Us don’t want to see Miss Violet done out of what’s hers,” declared\\nthe woman. “Cruel hard ’twould be for hospitals to get it all.”\\n\\nPoirot proceeded with his questions. Yes, Mr. and Mrs. Baker\\nremembered perfectly witnessing the will. Baker had previously been\\nsent into the neighbouring town to get two printed will-forms.\\n\\n“Two?” said Poirot sharply.\\n\\n“Yes, sir, for safety like, I suppose, in case he should spoil\\none—and sure enough, so he did do. Us had signed one——”\\n\\n“What time of day was that?”\\n\\nBaker scratched his head, but his wife was quicker.\\n\\n“Why, to be sure, I’d just put the milk on for the cocoa at eleven.\\nDon’t ee remember? It had all boiled over on the stove when us got\\nback to kitchen.”\\n\\n“And afterwards?”\\n\\n“’Twould be about an hour later. Us had to go in again. ‘I’ve made\\na mistake,’ says old master, ‘had to tear the whole thing up. I’ll\\ntrouble you to sign again,’ and us did. And afterwards master give\\nus a tidy sum of money each. ‘I’ve left you nothing in my will,’\\nsays he, ‘but each year I live you’ll have this to be a nest-egg\\nwhen I’m gone’; and sure enough, so he did.”\\n\\nPoirot reflected.\\n\\n“After you had signed the second time, what did Mr. Marsh do? Do\\nyou know?”\\n\\n“Went out to the village to pay tradesmen’s books.”\\n\\nThat did not seem very promising. Poirot tried another tack. He\\nheld out the key of the desk.\\n\\n“Is that your master’s writing?”\\n\\nI may have imagined it, but I fancied that a moment or two elapsed\\nbefore Baker replied: “Yes, sir, it is.”\\n\\n“He’s lying,” I thought. “But why?”\\n\\n“Has your master let the house?—have there been any strangers in\\nit during the last three years?”\\n\\n“No, sir.”\\n\\n“No visitors?”\\n\\n“Only Miss Violet.”\\n\\n“No strangers of any kind been inside this room?”\\n\\n“No, sir.”\\n\\n“You forget the workmen, Jim,” his wife reminded him.\\n\\n“Workmen?” Poirot wheeled round on her. “What workmen?”\\n\\nThe woman explained that about two years and a half ago workmen\\nhad been in the house to do certain repairs. She was quite vague\\nas to what the repairs were. Her view seemed to be that the whole\\nthing was a fad of her master’s and quite unnecessary. Part of the\\ntime the workmen had been in the study; but what they had done\\nthere she could not say, as her master had not let either of them\\ninto the room whilst the work was in progress. Unfortunately, they\\ncould not remember the name of the firm employed, beyond the fact\\nthat it was a Plymouth one.\\n\\n“We progress, Hastings,” said Poirot, rubbing his hands as the\\nBakers left the room. “Clearly he made a second will and then had\\nworkmen from Plymouth in to make a suitable hiding-place. Instead\\nof wasting time taking up the floor and tapping the walls, we will\\ngo to Plymouth.”\\n\\nWith a little trouble, we were able to get the information we\\nwanted. After one or two essays, we found the firm employed by Mr.\\nMarsh.\\n\\nTheir employees had all been with them many years, and it was easy\\nto find the two men who had worked under Mr. Marsh’s orders. They\\nremembered the job perfectly. Amongst various other minor jobs,\\nthey had taken up one of the bricks of the old-fashioned fireplace,\\nmade a cavity beneath, and so cut the brick that it was impossible\\nto see the join. By pressing on the second brick from the end, the\\nwhole thing was raised. It had been quite a complicated piece of\\nwork, and the old gentleman had been very fussy about it. Our\\ninformant was a man called Coghan, a big, gaunt man with a grizzled\\nmoustache. He seemed an intelligent fellow.\\n\\nWe returned to Crabtree Manor in high spirits, and, locking the\\nstudy door, proceeded to put our newly acquired knowledge into\\neffect. It was impossible to see any sign on the bricks, but when\\nwe pressed in the manner indicated, a deep cavity was at once\\ndisclosed.\\n\\nEagerly Poirot plunged in his hand. Suddenly his face fell from\\ncomplacent elation to consternation. All he held was a charred\\nfragment of stiff paper. But for it, the cavity was empty.\\n\\n“_Sacré!_” cried Poirot angrily. “Some one has been before us.”\\n\\nWe examined the scrap of paper anxiously. Clearly it was a fragment\\nof what we sought. A portion of Baker’s signature remained, but no\\nindication of what the terms of the will had been.\\n\\nPoirot sat back on his heels. His expression would have been\\ncomical if we had not been so overcome.\\n\\n“I understand it not,” he growled. “Who destroyed this? And what\\nwas their object?”\\n\\n“The Bakers?” I suggested.\\n\\n“_Pourquoi?_ Neither will makes any provision for them, and they\\nare more likely to be kept on with Miss Marsh than if the place\\nbecame the property of a hospital. How could it be to anyone’s\\nadvantage to destroy the will? The hospitals benefit—yes; but one\\ncannot suspect institutions.”\\n\\n“Perhaps the old man changed his mind and destroyed it himself,”\\nI suggested.\\n\\nPoirot rose to his feet, dusting his knees with his usual care.\\n\\n“That may be,” he admitted. “One of your more sensible observations,\\nHastings. Well, we can do no more here. We have done all that\\nmortal man can do. We have successfully pitted our wits against\\nthe late Andrew Marsh’s; but, unfortunately, his niece is no better\\noff for our success.”\\n\\nBy driving to the station at once, we were just able to catch a\\ntrain to London, though not the principal express. Poirot was sad\\nand dissatisfied. For my part, I was tired and dozed in a corner.\\nSuddenly, as we were just moving out of Taunton, Poirot uttered a\\npiercing squeal.\\n\\n“_Vite_, Hastings! Awake and jump! But jump I say!”\\n\\nBefore I knew where I was we were standing on the platform,\\nbareheaded and minus our valises, whilst the train disappeared into\\nthe night. I was furious. But Poirot paid no attention.\\n\\n“Imbecile that I have been!” he cried. “Triple imbecile! Not again\\nwill I vaunt my little grey cells!”\\n\\n“That’s a good job at any rate,” I said grumpily. “But what is this\\nall about?”\\n\\nAs usual, when following out his own ideas, Poirot paid absolutely\\nno attention to me.\\n\\n“The tradesmen’s books—I have left them entirely out of account!\\nYes, but where? Where? Never mind, I cannot be mistaken. We must\\nreturn at once.”\\n\\nEasier said than done. We managed to get a slow train to Exeter,\\nand there Poirot hired a car. We arrived back at Crabtree Manor in\\nthe small hours of the morning. I pass over the bewilderment of\\nthe Bakers when we had at last aroused them. Paying no attention\\nto anybody, Poirot strode at once to the study.\\n\\n“I have been, not a triple imbecile, but thirty-six times one, my\\nfriend,” he deigned to remark. “Now, behold!”\\n\\nGoing straight to the desk, he drew out the key, and detached the\\nenvelope from it. I stared at him stupidly. How could he possibly\\nhope to find a big will-form in that tiny envelope? With great care\\nhe cut open the envelope, laying it out flat. Then he lighted the\\nfire and held the plain inside surface of the envelope to the\\nflame. In a few minutes faint characters began to appear.\\n\\n“Look, _mon ami_!” cried Poirot in triumph.\\n\\nI looked. There were just a few lines of faint writing stating\\nbriefly that he left everything to his niece, Violet Marsh. It was\\ndated March 25, 12.30 p.m., and witnessed by Albert Pike,\\nconfectioner, and Jessie Pike, married woman.\\n\\n“But is it legal?” I gasped.\\n\\n“As far as I know, there is no law against writing your will in a\\nblend of disappearing and sympathetic ink. The intention of the\\ntestator is clear, and the beneficiary is his only living relation.\\nBut the cleverness of him! He foresaw every step that a searcher\\nwould take—that I, miserable imbecile, took. He gets two will-forms,\\nmakes the servants sign twice, then sallies out with his will\\nwritten on the inside of a dirty envelope and a fountain-pen\\ncontaining his little ink mixture. On some excuse he gets the\\nconfectioner and his wife to sign their names under his own\\nsignature, then he ties it to the key of his desk and chuckles to\\nhimself. If his niece sees through his little ruse, she will have\\njustified her choice of life and elaborate education, and be\\nthoroughly welcome to his money.”\\n\\n“She didn’t see through it, did she?” I said slowly. “It seems\\nrather unfair. The old man really won.”\\n\\n“But no, Hastings. It is _your_ wits that go astray. Miss Marsh\\nproved the astuteness of her wits and the value of the higher\\neducation for women by at once putting the matter in _my_ hands.\\nAlways employ the expert.

I had been transacting some business in\\nParis and was returning by the morning service to London where I was\\nstill sharing rooms with my old friend, the Belgian ex-detective,\\nHercule Poirot.\\n\\nThe Calais express was singularly empty—in fact, my own compartment\\nheld only one other traveller. I had made a somewhat hurried departure\\nfrom the hotel and was busy assuring myself that I had duly collected\\nall my traps when the train started. Up till then I had hardly noticed\\nmy companion, but I was now violently recalled to the fact of her\\nexistence. Jumping up from her seat, she let down the window and stuck\\nher head out, withdrawing it a moment later with the brief and forcible\\nejaculation “Hell!”\\n\\nNow I am old-fashioned. A woman, I consider, should be womanly. I have\\nno patience with the modern neurotic girl who jazzes from morning to\\nnight, smokes like a chimney, and uses language which would make a\\nBillingsgate fishwoman blush!\\n\\nI looked up now, frowning slightly, into a pretty, impudent face,\\nsurmounted by a rakish little red hat. A thick cluster of black curls\\nhid each ear. I judged that she was little more than seventeen, but her\\nface was covered with powder, and her lips were quite impossibly\\nscarlet.\\n\\nNothing abashed, she returned my glance, and executed an expressive\\ngrimace.\\n\\n“Dear me, we’ve shocked the kind gentleman!” she observed to an\\nimaginary audience. “I apologize for my language! Most unladylike, and\\nall that, but Oh, Lord, there’s reason enough for it! Do you know I’ve\\nlost my only sister?”\\n\\n“Really?” I said politely. “How unfortunate.”\\n\\n“He disapproves!” remarked the lady. “He disapproves utterly—of me, and\\nmy sister—which last is unfair, because he hasn’t seen her!”\\n\\nI opened my mouth, but she forestalled me.\\n\\n“Say no more! Nobody loves me! I shall go into the garden and eat\\nworms! Boohoo! I am crushed!”\\n\\nShe buried herself behind a large comic French paper. In a minute or\\ntwo I saw her eyes stealthily peeping at me over the top. In spite of\\nmyself I could not help smiling, and in a minute she had tossed the\\npaper aside, and had burst into a merry peal of laughter.\\n\\n“I knew you weren’t such a mutt as you looked,” she cried.\\n\\nHer laughter was so infectious that I could not help joining in, though\\nI hardly cared for the word “mutt.” The girl was certainly all that I\\nmost disliked, but that was no reason why I should make myself\\nridiculous by my attitude. I prepared to unbend. After all, she was\\ndecidedly pretty.\\u200a…\\n\\n“There! Now we’re friends!” declared the minx. “Say you’re sorry about\\nmy sister—”\\n\\n“I am desolated!”\\n\\n“That’s a good boy!”\\n\\n“Let me finish. I was going to add that, although I am desolated, I can\\nmanage to put up with her absence very well.” I made a little bow.\\n\\nBut this most unaccountable of damsels frowned and shook her head.\\n\\n“Cut it out. I prefer the ‘dignified disapproval’ stunt. Oh, your face!\\n‘Not one of us,’ it said. And you were right there—though, mind you,\\nit’s pretty hard to tell nowadays. It’s not every one who can\\ndistinguish between a demi and a duchess. There now, I believe I’ve\\nshocked you again! You’ve been dug out of the backwoods, you have. Not\\nthat I mind that. We could do with a few more of your sort. I just hate\\na fellow who gets fresh. It makes me mad.”\\n\\nShe shook her head vigorously.\\n\\n“What are you like when you’re mad?” I inquired with a smile.\\n\\n“A regular little devil! Don’t care what I say, or what I do, either! I\\nnearly did a chap in once. Yes, really. He’d have deserved it too.\\nItalian blood I’ve got. I shall get into trouble one of these days.”\\n\\n“Well,” I begged, “don’t get mad with me.”\\n\\n“I shan’t. I like you—did the first moment I set eyes on you. But you\\nlooked so disapproving that I never thought we should make friends.”\\n\\n“Well, we have. Tell me something about yourself.”\\n\\n“I’m an actress. No—not the kind you’re thinking of, lunching at the\\nSavoy covered with jewellery, and with their photograph in every paper\\nsaying how much they love Madame So and So’s face cream. I’ve been on\\nthe boards since I was a kid of six—tumbling.”\\n\\n“I beg your pardon,” I said puzzled.\\n\\n“Haven’t you seen child acrobats?”\\n\\n“Oh, I understand.”\\n\\n“I’m American born, but I’ve spent most of my life in England. We got a\\nnew show now—”\\n\\n“We?”\\n\\n“My sister and I. Sort of song and dance, and a bit of patter, and a\\ndash of the old business thrown in. It’s quite a new idea, and it hits\\nthem every time. There’s to be money in it—”\\n\\nMy new acquaintance leaned forward, and discoursed volubly, a great\\nmany of her terms being quite unintelligible to me. Yet I found myself\\nevincing an increasing interest in her. She seemed such a curious\\nmixture of child and woman. Though perfectly worldly-wise, and able, as\\nshe expressed it, to take care of herself, there was yet something\\ncuriously ingenuous in her single-minded attitude towards life, and her\\nwhole-hearted determination to “make good.” This glimpse of a world\\nunknown to me was not without its charm, and I enjoyed seeing her vivid\\nlittle face light up as she talked.\\n\\nWe passed through Amiens. The name awakened many memories. My companion\\nseemed to have an intuitive knowledge of what was in my mind.\\n\\n“Thinking of the War?”\\n\\nI nodded.\\n\\n“You were through it, I suppose?”\\n\\n“Pretty well. I was wounded once, and after the Somme they invalided me\\nout altogether. I had a half fledged Army job for a bit. I’m a sort of\\nprivate secretary now to an M. P.”\\n\\n“My! That’s brainy!”\\n\\n“No, it isn’t. There’s really awfully little to do. Usually a couple of\\nhours every day sees me through. It’s dull work too. In fact, I don’t\\nknow what I should do if I hadn’t got something to fall back upon.”\\n\\n“Don’t say you collect bugs!”\\n\\n“No. I share rooms with a very interesting man. He’s a Belgian—an\\nex-detective. He’s set up as a private detective in London, and he’s\\ndoing extraordinarily well. He’s really a very marvellous little man.\\nTime and again he has proved to be right where the official police have\\nfailed.”\\n\\nMy companion listened with widening eyes.\\n\\n“Isn’t that interesting, now? I just adore crime. I go to all the\\nmysteries on the movies. And when there’s a murder on I just devour the\\npapers.”\\n\\n“Do you remember the Styles Case?” I asked.\\n\\n“Let me see, was that the old lady who was poisoned? Somewhere down in\\nEssex?”\\n\\nI nodded.\\n\\n“That was Poirot’s first big case. Undoubtedly, but for him, the\\nmurderer would have escaped scot-free. It was a most wonderful bit of\\ndetective work.”\\n\\nWarming to my subject, I ran over the heads of the affair, working up\\nto the triumphant and unexpected dénouement. The girl listened\\nspellbound. In fact, we were so absorbed that the train drew into\\nCalais station before we realized it.\\n\\n“My goodness gracious me!” cried my companion. “Where’s my\\npowder-puff?”\\n\\nShe proceeded to bedaub her face liberally, and then applied a stick of\\nlip salve to her lips, observing the effect in a small pocket glass,\\nand betraying not the faintest sign of self-consciousness.\\n\\n“I say,” I hesitated. “I dare say it’s cheek on my part, but why do all\\nthat sort of thing?”\\n\\nThe girl paused in her operations, and stared at me with undisguised\\nsurprise.\\n\\n“It isn’t as though you weren’t so pretty that you can afford to do\\nwithout it,” I said stammeringly.\\n\\n“My dear boy! I’ve got to do it. All the girls do. Think I want to look\\nlike a little frump up from the country?” She took one last look in the\\nmirror, smiled approval, and put it and her vanity-box away in her bag.\\n“That’s better. Keeping up appearances is a bit of a fag, I grant, but\\nif a girl respects herself it’s up to her not to let herself get\\nslack.”\\n\\nTo this essentially moral sentiment, I had no reply. A point of view\\nmakes a great difference.\\n\\nI secured a couple of porters, and we alighted on the platform. My\\ncompanion held out her hand.\\n\\n“Good-bye, and I’ll mind my language better in future.”\\n\\n“Oh, but surely you’ll let me look after you on the boat?”\\n\\n“Mayn’t be on the boat. I’ve got to see whether that sister of mine got\\naboard after all anywhere. But thanks all the same.”\\n\\n“Oh, but we’re going to meet again, surely? I—” I hesitated. “I want to\\nmeet your sister.”\\n\\nWe both laughed.\\n\\n“That’s real nice of you. I’ll tell her what you say. But I don’t fancy\\nwe’ll meet again. You’ve been very good to me on the journey,\\nespecially after I cheeked you as I did. But what your face expressed\\nfirst thing is quite true. I’m not your kind. And that brings\\ntrouble—_I___ know that well enough.\\u200a…”\\n\\nHer face changed. For the moment all the light-hearted gaiety died out\\nof it. It looked angry—revengeful.\\u200a…\\n\\n“So good-bye,” she finished, in a lighter tone.\\n\\n“Aren’t you even going to tell me your name?” I cried, as she turned\\naway.\\n\\nShe looked over her shoulder. A dimple appeared in each cheek. She was\\nlike a lovely picture by Greuze.\\n\\n“Cinderella,” she said, and laughed.\\n\\nBut little did I think when and how I should see Cinderella again.\\n\\n\\n\\n2 An Appeal for Help\\n\\nIt was five minutes past nine when I entered our joint sitting-room for\\nbreakfast on the following morning.\\n\\nMy friend Poirot, exact to the minute as usual, was just tapping the\\nshell of his second egg.\\n\\nHe beamed upon me as I entered.\\n\\n“You have slept well, yes? You have recovered from the crossing so\\nterrible? It is a marvel, almost you are exact this morning.\\n_Pardon___, but your tie is not symmetrical. Permit that I rearrange\\nhim.”\\n\\nElsewhere, I have described Hercule Poirot. An extraordinary little\\nman! Height, five feet four inches, egg-shaped head carried a little to\\none side, eyes that shone green when he was excited, stiff military\\nmoustache, air of dignity immense! He was neat and dandified in\\nappearance. For neatness of any kind, he had an absolute passion. To\\nsee an ornament set crooked, or a speck of dust, or a slight disarray\\nin one’s attire, was torture to the little man until he could ease his\\nfeelings by remedying the matter. “Order” and “Method” were his gods.\\nHe had a certain disdain for tangible evidence, such as footprints and\\ncigarette ash, and would maintain that, taken by themselves, they would\\nnever enable a detective to solve a problem. Then he would tap his\\negg-shaped head with absurd complacency, and remark with great\\nsatisfaction: “The true work, it is done from _within___. _The little\\ngrey cells___—remember always the little grey cells, _mon ami!___”\\n\\nI slipped into my seat, and remarked idly, in answer to Poirot’s\\ngreeting, that an hour’s sea passage from Calais to Dover could hardly\\nbe dignified by the epithet “terrible.”\\n\\nPoirot waved his egg-spoon in vigorous refutation of my remark.\\n\\n“_Du tout!___ If for an hour one experiences sensations and emotions of\\nthe most terrible, one has lived many hours! Does not one of your\\nEnglish poets say that time is counted, not by hours, but by\\nheart-beats?”\\n\\n“I fancy Browning was referring to something more romantic than sea\\nsickness, though.”\\n\\n“Because he was an Englishman, an Islander to whom _la Manche___ was\\nnothing. Oh, you English! With _nous autres___ it is different. Figure\\nto yourself that a lady of my acquaintance at the beginning of the war\\nfled to Ostend. There she had a terrible crisis of the nerves.\\nImpossible to escape further except by crossing the sea! And she had a\\nhorror—_mais une horreur!___—of the sea! What was she to do? Daily _les\\nBoches___ were drawing nearer. Imagine to yourself the terrible\\nsituation!”\\n\\n“What did she do?” I inquired curiously.\\n\\n“Fortunately her husband was _homme pratique___. He was also very calm,\\nthe crises of the nerves, they affected him not. _Il l’a emportée\\nsimplement!___ Naturally when she reached England she was prostrate,\\nbut she still breathed.”\\n\\nPoirot shook his head seriously. I composed my face as best I could.\\n\\nSuddenly he stiffened and pointed a dramatic finger at the toast rack.\\n\\n“Ah, par exemple, c’est trop fort!” he cried.\\n\\n“What is it?”\\n\\n“This piece of toast. You remark him not?” He whipped the offender out\\nof the rack, and held it up for me to examine.\\n\\n“Is it square? No. Is it a triangle? Again no. Is it even round? No. Is\\nit of any shape remotely pleasing to the eye? What symmetry have we\\nhere? None.”\\n\\n“It’s cut from a cottage loaf,” I explained soothingly.\\n\\nPoirot threw me a withering glance.\\n\\n“What an intelligence has my friend Hastings!” he exclaimed\\nsarcastically. “Comprehend you not that I have forbidden such a loaf—a\\nloaf haphazard and shapeless, that no baker should permit himself to\\nbake!”\\n\\nI endeavoured to distract his mind.\\n\\n“Anything interesting come by the post?”\\n\\nPoirot shook his head with a dissatisfied air.\\n\\n“I have not yet examined my letters, but nothing of interest arrives\\nnowadays. The great criminals, the criminals of method, they do not\\nexist. The cases I have been employed upon lately were _banal___ to the\\nlast degree. In verity I am reduced to recovering lost lap-dogs for\\nfashionable ladies! The last problem that presented any interest was\\nthat intricate little affair of the Yardly diamond, and that was—how\\nmany months ago, my friend?”\\n\\nHe shook his head despondently, and I roared with laughter.\\n\\n“Cheer up, Poirot, the luck will change. Open your letters. For all you\\nknow, there may be a great Case looming on the horizon.”\\n\\nPoirot smiled, and taking up the neat little letter opener with which\\nhe opened his correspondence he slit the tops of the several envelopes\\nthat lay by his plate.\\n\\n“A bill. Another bill. It is that I grow extravagant in my old age.\\nAha! a note from Japp.”\\n\\n“Yes?” pricked up my ears. The Scotland Yard Inspector had more than\\nonce introduced us to an interesting case.\\n\\n“He merely thanks me (in his fashion) for a little point in the\\nAberystwyth Case on which I was able to set him right. I am delighted\\nto have been of service to him.”\\n\\n“How does he thank you?” I asked curiously, for I knew my Japp.\\n\\n“He is kind enough to say that I am a wonderful sport for my age, and\\nthat he was glad to have had the chance of letting me in on the case.”\\n\\nThis was so typical of Japp, that I could not forbear a chuckle. Poirot\\ncontinued to read his correspondence placidly.\\n\\n“A suggestion that I should give a lecture to our local boy scouts. The\\nCountess of Forfanock will be obliged if I will call and see her.\\nAnother lap-dog without doubt! And now for the last. Ah—”\\n\\nI looked up, quick to notice the change of tone. Poirot was reading\\nattentively. In a minute he tossed the sheet over to me.\\n\\n“This is out of the ordinary, _mon ami___. Read for yourself.”\\n\\nThe letter was written on a foreign type of paper, in a bold\\ncharacteristic hand:\\n\\n“Villa Geneviève\\nMerlinville-sur-Mer\\nFrance\\n\\n\\n“_Dear Sir___,\\n“I am in need of the services of a detective and, for reasons which I\\nwill give you later, do not wish to call in the official police. I have\\nheard of you from several quarters, and all reports go to show that you\\nare not only a man of decided ability, but one who also knows how to be\\ndiscreet. I do not wish to trust details to the post, but, on account\\nof a secret I possess, I go in daily fear of my life. I am convinced\\nthat the danger is imminent, and therefore I beg that you will lose no\\ntime in crossing to France. I will send a car to meet you at Calais, if\\nyou will wire me when you are arriving. I shall be obliged if you will\\ndrop all cases you have on hand, and devote yourself solely to my\\ninterests. I am prepared to pay any compensation necessary. I shall\\nprobably need your services for a considerable period of time, as it\\nmay be necessary for you to go out to Santiago, where I spent several\\nyears of my life. I shall be content for you to name your own fee.\\n    “Assuring you once more that the matter is _urgent___,\\n\\n\\n“Yours faithfully\\n“P. T. RENAULD.”\\n\\n\\nBelow the signature was a hastily scrawled line, almost illegible: “For\\nGod’s sake, come!”\\n\\nI handed the letter back with quickened pulses.\\n\\n“At last!” I said. “Here is something distinctly out of the ordinary.”\\n\\n“Yes, indeed,” said Poirot meditatively.\\n\\n“You will go of course,” I continued.\\n\\nPoirot nodded. He was thinking deeply. Finally he seemed to make up his\\nmind, and glanced up at the clock. His face was very grave.\\n\\n“See you, my friend, there is no time to lose. The Continental express\\nleaves Victoria at 11 o’clock. Do not agitate yourself. There is plenty\\nof time. We can allow ten minutes for discussion. You accompany me,\\n_n’est-ce pas?___”\\n\\n“Well—”\\n\\n“You told me yourself that your employer needed you not for the next\\nfew weeks.”\\n\\n“Oh, that’s all right. But this Mr. Renauld hints strongly that his\\nbusiness is private.”\\n\\n“Ta-ta-ta. I will manage M. Renauld. By the way, I seem to know the\\nname?”\\n\\n“There’s a well-known South American millionaire fellow. His name’s\\nRenauld. I don’t know whether it could be the same.”\\n\\n“But without doubt. That explains the mention of Santiago. Santiago is\\nin Chile, and Chile it is in South America! Ah, but we progress\\nfinely.”\\n\\n“Dear me, Poirot,” I said, my excitement rising, “I smell some goodly\\nshekels in this. If we succeed, we shall make our fortunes!”\\n\\n“Do not be too sure of that, my friend. A rich man and his money are\\nnot so easily parted. Me, I have seen a well-known millionaire turn out\\na tramful of people to seek for a dropped halfpenny.”\\n\\nI acknowledged the wisdom of this.\\n\\n“In any case,” continued Poirot, “it is not the money which attracts me\\nhere. Certainly it will be pleasant to have _carte blanche___ in our\\ninvestigations; one can be sure that way of wasting no time, but it is\\nsomething a little bizarre in this problem which arouses my interest.\\nYou remarked the postscript? How did it strike you?”\\n\\nI considered.\\n\\n“Clearly he wrote the letter keeping himself well in hand, but at the\\nend his self-control snapped and, on the impulse of the moment, he\\nscrawled those four desperate words.”\\n\\nBut my friend shook his head energetically.\\n\\n“You are in error. See you not that while the ink of the signature is\\nnearly black, that of the postscript is quite pale?”\\n\\n“Well?” I said puzzled.\\n\\n“_Mon Dieu, mon ami___, but use your little grey cells! Is it not\\nobvious? M. Renauld wrote his letter. Without blotting it, he reread it\\ncarefully. Then, not on impulse, but deliberately, he added those last\\nwords, and blotted the sheet.”\\n\\n“But why?”\\n\\n“_Parbleu!___ so that it should produce the effect upon me that it has\\nupon you.”\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“_Mais, oui___—to make sure of my coming! He reread the letter and was\\ndissatisfied. It was not strong enough!”\\n\\nHe paused, and then added softly, his eyes shining with that green\\nlight that always betokened inward excitement: “And so, _mon ami___,\\nsince that postscript was added, not on impulse, but soberly, in cold\\nblood, the urgency is very great, and we must reach him as soon as\\npossible.”\\n\\n“Merlinville,” I murmured thoughtfully. “I’ve heard of it, I think.”\\n\\nPoirot nodded.\\n\\n“It is a quiet little place—but chic! It lies about midway between\\nBolougne and Calais. It is rapidly becoming the fashion. Rich English\\npeople who wish to be quiet are taking it up. M. Renauld has a house in\\nEngland, I suppose?”\\n\\n“Yes, in Rutland Gate, as far as I remember. Also a big place in the\\ncountry, somewhere in Hertfordshire. But I really know very little\\nabout him, he doesn’t do much in a social way. I believe he has large\\nSouth American interests in the City, and has spent most of his life\\nout in Chile and the Argentino.”\\n\\n“Well, we shall hear all details from the man himself. Come, let us\\npack. A small suit-case each, and then a taxi to Victoria.”\\n\\n“And the Countess?” I inquired with a smile.\\n\\n“Ah! _je m’en fiche!___ Her case was certainly not interesting.”\\n\\n“Why so sure of that?”\\n\\n“Because in that case she would have come, not written. A woman cannot\\nwait—always remember that, Hastings.”\\n\\nEleven o’clock saw our departure from Victoria on our way to Dover.\\nBefore starting Poirot had despatched a telegram to Mr. Renauld giving\\nthe time of our arrival at Calais. “I’m surprised you haven’t invested\\nin a few bottles of some sea sick remedy, Poirot,” I observed\\nmaliciously, as I recalled our conversation at breakfast.\\n\\nMy friend, who was anxiously scanning the weather, turned a reproachful\\nface upon me.\\n\\n“Is it that you have forgotten the method most excellent of Laverguier?\\nHis system, I practise it always. One balances oneself, if you\\nremember, turning the head from left to right, breathing in and out,\\ncounting six between each breath.”\\n\\n“H’m,” I demurred. “You’ll be rather tired of balancing yourself and\\ncounting six by the time you get to Santiago, or Buenos Ayres, or\\nwherever it is you land.”\\n\\n“_Quelle idée!___ You do not figure to yourself that I shall go to\\nSantiago?”\\n\\n“Mr. Renauld suggests it in his letter.”\\n\\n“He did not know the methods of Hercule Poirot. I do not run to and\\nfro, making journeys, and agitating myself. My work is done from\\nwithin—_here___—” he tapped his forehead significantly.\\n\\nAs usual, this remark roused my argumentative faculty.\\n\\n“It’s all very well, Poirot, but I think you are falling into the habit\\nof despising certain things too much. A finger-print has led sometimes\\nto the arrest and conviction of a murderer.”\\n\\n“And has, without doubt, hanged more than one innocent man,” remarked\\nPoirot dryly.\\n\\n“But surely the study of finger-prints and footprints, cigarette ash,\\ndifferent kinds of mud, and other clues that comprise the minute\\nobservation of details—all these are of vital importance?”\\n\\n“But certainly. I have never said otherwise. The trained observer, the\\nexpert, without doubt he is useful! But the others, the Hercules\\nPoirots, they are above the experts! To them the experts bring the\\nfacts, their business is the method of the crime, its logical\\ndeduction, the proper sequence and order of the facts; above all, the\\ntrue psychology of the case. You have hunted the fox, yes?”\\n\\n“I have hunted a bit, now and again,” I said, rather bewildered by this\\nabrupt change of subject. “Why?”\\n\\n“_Eh bien___, this hunting of the fox, you need the dogs, no?”\\n\\n“Hounds,” I corrected gently. “Yes, of course.”\\n\\n“But yet,” Poirot wagged his finger at me. “You did not descend from\\nyour horse and run along the ground smelling with your nose and\\nuttering loud Ow Ows?”\\n\\nIn spite of myself I laughed immoderately. Poirot nodded in a satisfied\\nmanner.\\n\\n“So. You leave the work of the d— hounds to the hounds. Yet you demand\\nthat I, Hercule Poirot, should make myself ridiculous by lying down\\n(possibly on damp grass) to study hypothetical footprints, and should\\nscoop up cigarette ash when I do not know one kind from the other.\\nRemember the Plymouth Express mystery. The good Japp departed to make a\\nsurvey of the railway line. When he returned, I, without having moved\\nfrom my apartments, was able to tell him exactly what he had found.”\\n\\n“So you are of the opinion that Japp wasted his time.”\\n\\n“Not at all, since his evidence confirmed my theory. But _I___ should\\nhave wasted my time if _I___ had gone. It is the same with so called\\n‘experts.’ Remember the handwriting testimony in the Cavendish Case.\\nOne counsel’s questioning brings out testimony as to the resemblances,\\nthe defence brings evidence to show dissimilarity. All the language is\\nvery technical. And the result? What we all knew in the first place.\\nThe writing was very like that of John Cavendish. And the psychological\\nmind is faced with the question ‘Why?’ Because it was actually his? Or\\nbecause some one wished us to think it was his? I answered that\\nquestion, _mon ami___, and answered it correctly.”\\n\\nAnd Poirot, having effectually silenced, if not convinced me, leaned\\nback with a satisfied air.\\n\\nOn the boat, I knew better than to disturb my friend’s solitude. The\\nweather was gorgeous, and the sea as smooth as the proverbial\\nmill-pond, so I was hardly surprised to hear that Laverguier’s method\\nhad once more justified itself when a smiling Poirot joined me on\\ndisembarking at Calais. A disappointment was in store for us, as no car\\nhad been sent to meet us, but Poirot put this down to his telegram\\nhaving been delayed in transit.\\n\\n“Since it is _carte blanche___, we will hire a car,” he said\\ncheerfully. And a few minutes later saw us creaking and jolting along,\\nin the most ramshackle of automobiles that ever plied for hire, in the\\ndirection of Merlinville.\\n\\nMy spirits were at their highest.\\n\\n“What gorgeous air!” I exclaimed. “This promises to be a delightful\\ntrip.”\\n\\n“For you, yes. For me, I have work to do, remember, at our journey’s\\nend.”\\n\\n“Bah!” I said cheerfully. “You will discover all, ensure this Mr.\\nRenauld’s safety, run the would-be assassins to earth, and all will\\nfinish in a blaze of glory.”\\n\\n“You are sanguine, my friend.”\\n\\n“Yes, I feel absolutely assured of success. Are you not the one and\\nonly Hercule Poirot?”\\n\\nBut my little friend did not rise to the bait. He was observing me\\ngravely.\\n\\n“You are what the Scotch people call ‘fey,’ Hastings. It presages\\ndisaster.”\\n\\n“Nonsense. At any rate, you do not share my feelings.”\\n\\n“No, but I am afraid.”\\n\\n“Afraid of what?”\\n\\n“I do not know. But I have a premonition—a _je ne sais quoi!___”\\n\\nHe spoke so gravely, that I was impressed in spite of myself.\\n\\n“I have a feeling,” he said slowly, “that this is going to be a big\\naffair—a long, troublesome problem that will not be easy to work out.”\\n\\nI would have questioned him further, but we were just coming into the\\nlittle town of Merlinville, and we slowed up to inquire the way to the\\nVilla Geneviève.\\n\\n“Straight on, monsieur, through the town. The Villa Geneviève is about\\nhalf a mile the other side. You cannot miss it. A big Villa,\\noverlooking the sea.”\\n\\nWe thanked our informant, and drove on, leaving the town behind. A fork\\nin the road brought us to a second halt. A peasant was trudging towards\\nus, and we waited for him to come up to us in order to ask the way\\nagain. There was a tiny Villa standing right by the road, but it was\\ntoo small and dilapidated to be the one we wanted. As we waited, the\\ngate of it swung open and a girl came out.\\n\\nThe peasant was passing us now, and the driver leaned forward from his\\nseat and asked for direction.\\n\\n“The Villa Geneviève? Just a few steps up this road to the right,\\nmonsieur. You could see it if it were not for the curve.”\\n\\nThe chauffeur thanked him, and started the car again. My eyes were\\nfascinated by the girl who still stood, with one hand on the gate,\\nwatching us. I am an admirer of beauty, and here was one whom nobody\\ncould have passed without remark. Very tall, with the proportions of a\\nyoung goddess, her uncovered golden head gleaming in the sunlight, I\\nswore to myself that she was one of the most beautiful girls I had ever\\nseen. As we swung up the rough road, I turned my head to look after\\nher.\\n\\n“By Jove, Poirot,” I exclaimed, “did you see that young goddess.”\\n\\nPoirot raised his eyebrows.\\n\\n“_Ça commence!___” he murmured. “Already you have seen a goddess!”\\n\\n“But, hang it all, wasn’t she?”\\n\\n“Possibly. I did not remark the fact.”\\n\\n“Surely you noticed her?”\\n\\n“_Mon ami___, two people rarely see the same thing. You, for instance,\\nsaw a goddess. I—” he hesitated.\\n\\n“Yes?”\\n\\n“I saw only a girl with anxious eyes,” said Poirot gravely.\\n\\nBut at that moment we drew up at a big green gate, and, simultaneously,\\nwe both uttered an exclamation. Before it stood an imposing _sergent de\\nville___. He held up his hand to bar our way.\\n\\n“You cannot pass, monsieurs.”\\n\\n“But we wish to see Mr. Renauld,” I cried. “We have an appointment.\\nThis is his Villa, isn’t it?”\\n\\n“Yes, monsieur, but—”\\n\\nPoirot leaned forward.\\n\\n“But what?”\\n\\n“M. Renauld was murdered this morning.”\\n\\n\\n\\n3 At the Villa Geneviève\\n\\nIn a moment Poirot had leapt from the car, his eyes blazing with\\nexcitement. He caught the man by the shoulder.\\n\\n“What is that you say? Murdered? When? How?”\\n\\nThe _sergent de ville___ drew himself up.\\n\\n“I cannot answer any questions, monsieur.”\\n\\n“True. I comprehend.” Poirot reflected for a minute. “The Commissary of\\nPolice, he is without doubt within?”\\n\\n“Yes, monsieur.”\\n\\nPoirot took out a card, and scribbled a few words on it.\\n\\n“_Voilà!___ Will you have the goodness to see that this card is sent in\\nto the commissary at once?”\\n\\nThe man took it and, turning his head over his shoulder, whistled. In a\\nfew seconds a comrade joined him and was handed Poirot’s message. There\\nwas a wait of some minutes, and then a short stout man with a huge\\nmoustache came bustling down to the gate. The _sergent de ville___\\nsaluted and stood aside.\\n\\n“My dear M. Poirot,” cried the new-comer, “I am delighted to see you.\\nYour arrival is most opportune.”\\n\\nPoirot’s face had lighted up.\\n\\n“M. Bex! This is indeed a pleasure.” He turned to me. “This is an\\nEnglish friend of mine, Captain Hastings—M. Lucien Bex.”\\n\\nThe commissary and I bowed to each other ceremoniously, then M. Bex\\nturned once more to Poirot.\\n\\n“_Mon vieux___, I have not seen you since 1909, that time in Ostend. I\\nheard that you had left the Force?”\\n\\n“So I have. I run a private business in London.”\\n\\n“And you say you have information to give which may assist us?”\\n\\n“Possibly you know it already. You were aware that I had been sent\\nfor?”\\n\\n“No. By whom?”\\n\\n“The dead man. It seems he knew an attempt was going to be made on his\\nlife. Unfortunately he sent for me too late.”\\n\\n“_Sacri tonnerre!___” ejaculated the Frenchman. “So he foresaw his own\\nmurder? That upsets our theories considerably! But come inside.”\\n\\nHe held the gate open, and we commenced walking towards the house. M.\\nBex continued to talk:\\n\\n“The examining magistrate, M. Hautet, must hear of this at once. He has\\njust finished examining the scene of the crime and is about to begin\\nhis interrogations. A charming man. You will like him. Most\\nsympathetic. Original in his methods, but an excellent judge.”\\n\\n“When was the crime committed?” asked Poirot.\\n\\n“The body was discovered this morning about nine o’clock. Madame\\nRenauld’s evidence, and that of the doctors goes to show that the death\\nmust have occurred about 2 a.m. But enter, I pray of you.”\\n\\nWe had arrived at the steps which led up to the front door of the\\nVilla. In the hall another _sergent de ville___ was sitting. He rose at\\nsight of the commissary.\\n\\n“Where is M. Hautet now?” inquired the latter.\\n\\n“In the _salon___, monsieur.”\\n\\nM. Bex opened a door to the left of the hall, and we passed in. M.\\nHautet and his clerk were sitting at a big round table. They looked up\\nas we entered. The commissary introduced us, and explained our\\npresence.\\n\\nM. Hautet, the Juge d’Instruction, was a tall, gaunt man, with piercing\\ndark eyes, and a neatly cut grey beard, which he had a habit of\\ncaressing as he talked. Standing by the mantelpiece was an elderly man,\\nwith slightly stooping shoulders, who was introduced to us as Dr.\\nDurand.\\n\\n“Most extraordinary,” remarked M. Hautet, as the commissary finished\\nspeaking. “You have the letter here, monsieur?”\\n\\nPoirot handed it to him, and the magistrate read it.\\n\\n“H’m. He speaks of a secret. What a pity he was not more explicit. We\\nare much indebted to you, M. Poirot. I hope you will do us the honour\\nof assisting us in our investigations. Or are you obliged to return to\\nLondon?”\\n\\n“M. le juge, I propose to remain. I did not arrive in time to prevent\\nmy client’s death, but I feel myself bound in honour to discover the\\nassassin.”\\n\\nThe magistrate bowed.\\n\\n“These sentiments do you honour. Also, without doubt, Madame Renauld\\nwill wish to retain your services. We are expecting M. Giraud from the\\nSûreté in Paris any moment, and I am sure that you and he will be able\\nto give each other mutual assistance in your investigations. In the\\nmeantime, I hope that you will do me the honour to be present at my\\ninterrogations, and I need hardly say that if there is any assistance\\nyou require it is at your disposal.”\\n\\n“I thank you, monsieur. You will comprehend that at present I am\\ncompletely in the dark. I know nothing whatever.”\\n\\nM. Hautet nodded to the commissary, and the latter took up the tale:\\n\\n“This morning, the old servant Françoise, on descending to start her\\nwork, found the front door ajar. Feeling a momentary alarm as to\\nburglars, she looked into the dining-room, but seeing the silver was\\nsafe she thought no more about it, concluding that her master had,\\nwithout doubt, risen early, and gone for a stroll.”\\n\\n“Pardon, monsieur, for interrupting, but was that a common practice of\\nhis?”\\n\\n“No, it was not, but old Françoise has the common idea as regards the\\nEnglish—that they are mad, and liable to do the most unaccountable\\nthings at any moment! Going to call her mistress as usual, a younger\\nmaid, Léonie, was horrified to discover her gagged and bound, and\\nalmost at the same moment news was brought that M. Renauld’s body had\\nbeen discovered, stone dead, stabbed in the back.”\\n\\n“Where?”\\n\\n“That is one of the most extraordinary features of the case. M. Poirot,\\nthe body was lying, face downwards, _in an open grave___.”\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“Yes. The pit was freshly dug—just a few yards outside the boundary of\\nthe Villa grounds.”\\n\\n“And he had been dead—how long?”\\n\\nDr. Durand answered this.\\n\\n“I examined the body this morning at ten o’clock. Death must have taken\\nplace at least seven, and possibly ten hours previously.”\\n\\n“H’m, that fixes it at between midnight and 3 a.m.”\\n\\n“Exactly, and Madame Renauld’s evidence places it at after 2 a.m. which\\nnarrows the field still further. Death must have been instantaneous,\\nand naturally could not have been self-inflicted.”\\n\\nPoirot nodded, and the commissary resumed:\\n\\n“Madame Renauld was hastily freed from the cords that bound her by the\\nhorrified servants. She was in a terrible condition of weakness, almost\\nunconscious from the pain of her bonds. It appears that two masked men\\nentered the bedroom, gagged and bound her, whilst forcibly abducting\\nher husband. This we know at second hand from the servants. On hearing\\nthe tragic news, she fell at once into an alarming state of agitation.\\nOn arrival, Dr. Durand immediately prescribed a sedative, and we have\\nnot yet been able to question her. But without doubt she will awake\\nmore calm, and be equal to bearing the strain of the interrogation.”\\n\\nThe commissary paused.\\n\\n“And the inmates of the house, monsieur?”\\n\\n“There is old Françoise, the housekeeper, she lived for many years with\\nthe former owners of the Villa Geneviève. Then there are two young\\ngirls, sisters, Denise and Léonie Oulard. Their home is in Merlinville,\\nand they come of the most respectable parents. Then there is the\\nchauffeur whom M. Renauld brought over from England with him, but he is\\naway on a holiday. Finally there are Madame Renauld and her son, M.\\nJack Renauld. He, too, is away from home at present.”\\n\\nPoirot bowed his head. M. Hautet spoke:\\n\\n“Marchaud!”\\n\\nThe _sergent de ville___ appeared.\\n\\n“Bring in the woman Françoise.”\\n\\nThe man saluted, and disappeared. In a moment or two, he returned,\\nescorting the frightened Françoise.\\n\\n“You name is Françoise Arrichet?”\\n\\n“Yes, monsieur.”\\n\\n“You have been a long time in service at the Villa Geneviève?”\\n\\n“Eleven years with Madame la Vicomtesse. Then when she sold the Villa\\nthis spring, I consented to remain on with the English milor. Never did\\nI imagine—”\\n\\nThe magistrate cut her short.\\n\\n“Without doubt, without doubt. Now, Françoise, in this matter of the\\nfront door, whose business was it to fasten it at night?”\\n\\n“Mine, monsieur. Always I saw to it myself.”\\n\\n“And last night?”\\n\\n“I fastened it as usual.”\\n\\n“You are sure of that?”\\n\\n“I swear it by the blessed saints, monsieur.”\\n\\n“What time would that be?”\\n\\n“The same time as usual, half-past ten, monsieur.”\\n\\n“What about the rest of the household, had they gone up to bed?”\\n\\n“Madame had retired some time before. Denise and Léonie went up with\\nme. Monsieur was still in his study.”\\n\\n“Then, if any one unfastened the door afterwards, it must have been M.\\nRenauld himself?”\\n\\nFrançoise shrugged her broad shoulders.\\n\\n“What should he do that for? With robbers and assassins passing every\\nminute! A nice idea! Monsieur was not an imbecile. It is not as though\\nhe had had to let _cette dame___ out—”\\n\\nThe magistrate interrupted sharply:\\n\\n“_Cette dame?___ What lady do you mean?”\\n\\n“Why, the lady who came to see him.”\\n\\n“Had a lady been to see him that evening?”\\n\\n“But yes, monsieur—and many other evenings as well.”\\n\\n“Who was she? Did you know her?”\\n\\nA rather cunning look spread over the woman’s face. “How should I know\\nwho it was?” she grumbled. “I did not let her in last night.”\\n\\n“Aha!” roared the examining magistrate, bringing his hand down with a\\nbang on the table. “You would trifle with the police, would you? I\\ndemand that you tell me at once the name of this woman who came to\\nvisit M. Renauld in the evenings.”\\n\\n“The police—the police,” grumbled Françoise. “Never did I think that I\\nshould be mixed up with the police. But I know well enough who she was.\\nIt was Madame Daubreuil.”\\n\\nThe commissary uttered an exclamation, and leaned forward as though in\\nutter astonishment.\\n\\n“Madame Daubreuil—from the Villa Marguerite just down the road?”\\n\\n“That is what I said, monsieur. Oh, she is a pretty one, _cellela!___”\\nThe old woman tossed her head scornfully.\\n\\n“Madame Daubreuil,” murmured the commissary. “Impossible.”\\n\\n“_Voilà,___” grumbled Françoise. “That is all you get for telling the\\ntruth.”\\n\\n“Not at all,” said the examining magistrate soothingly. “We were\\nsurprised, that is all. Madame Daubreuil then, and Monsieur Renauld,\\nthey were—” he paused delicately. “Eh? It was that without doubt?”\\n\\n“How should I know? But what will you? Monsieur, he was _milor\\nanglais___—_trés riche___—and Madame Daubreuil, she was poor, that\\none—and _trés chic___ for all that she lives so quietly with her\\ndaughter. Not a doubt of it, she has had her history! She is no longer\\nyoung, but _ma foi!___ I who speak to you have seen the men’s heads\\nturn after her as she goes down the street. Besides lately, she has had\\nmore money to spend—all the town knows it. The little economies, they\\nare at an end.” And Françoise shook her head with an air of unalterable\\ncertainty.\\n\\nM. Hautet stroked his beard reflectively.\\n\\n“And Madame Renauld?” he asked at length. “How did she take\\nthis—friendship.”\\n\\nFrançoise shrugged her shoulders.\\n\\n“She was always most amiable—most polite. One would say that she\\nsuspected nothing. But all the same, is it not so, the heart suffers,\\nmonsieur? Day by day, I have watched Madame grow paler and thinner. She\\nwas not the same woman who arrived here a month ago. Monsieur, too, has\\nchanged. He also has had his worries. One could see that he was on the\\nbrink of a crisis of the nerves. And who could wonder, with an affair\\nconducted such a fashion? No reticence, no discretion. _Style\\nanglais___, without doubt!”\\n\\nI bounded indignantly in my seat, but the examining magistrate was\\ncontinuing his questions, undistracted by side issues.\\n\\n“You say that M. Renauld had not to let Madame Daubreuil out? Had she\\nleft, then?”\\n\\n“Yes, monsieur. I heard them come out of the study and go to the door.\\nMonsieur said good night, and shut the door after her.”\\n\\n“What time was that?”\\n\\n“About twenty-five minutes after ten, monsieur.”\\n\\n“Do you know when M. Renauld went to bed?”\\n\\n“I heard him come up about ten minutes after we did. The stair creaks\\nso that one hears every one who goes up and down.”\\n\\n“And that is all? You heard no sound of disturbance during the night?”\\n\\n“Nothing whatever, monsieur.”\\n\\n“Which of the servants came down the first in the morning?”\\n\\n“I did, monsieur. At once I saw the door swinging open.”\\n\\n“What about the other downstairs windows, were they all fastened?”\\n\\n“Every one of them. There was nothing suspicious or out of place\\nanywhere.”\\n\\n“Good, Françoise, you can go.”\\n\\nThe old woman shuffled towards the door. On the threshold she looked\\nback.\\n\\n“I will tell you one thing, monsieur. That Madame Daubreuil she is a\\nbad one! Oh, yes, one woman knows about another. She is a bad one,\\nremember that.” And, shaking her head sagely, Françoise left the room.\\n\\n“Léonie Oulard,” called the magistrate.\\n\\nLéonie appeared dissolved in tears, and inclined to be hysterical. M.\\nHautet dealt with her adroitly. Her evidence was mainly concerned with\\nthe discovery of her mistress gagged and bound, of which she gave\\nrather an exaggerated account. She, like Françoise, had heard nothing\\nduring the night.\\n\\nHer sister, Denise, succeeded her. She agreed that her master had\\nchanged greatly of late.\\n\\n“Every day he became more and more morose. He ate less. He was always\\ndepressed.” But Denise had her own theory. “Without doubt it was the\\nMafia he had on his track! Two masked men—who else could it be? A\\nterrible society that!”\\n\\n“It is, of course, possible,” said the magistrate smoothly. “Now, my\\ngirl, was it you who admitted Madame Daubreuil to the house last\\nnight?”\\n\\n“Not _last___ night, monsieur, the night before.”\\n\\n“But Françoise has just told us that Madame Daubreuil was here last\\nnight?”\\n\\n“No, monsieur. A lady _did___ come to see M. Renauld last night, but it\\nwas not Madame Daubreuil.”\\n\\nSurprised, the magistrate insisted, but the girl held firm. She knew\\nMadame Daubreuil perfectly by sight. This lady was dark also, but\\nshorter, and much younger. Nothing could shake her statement.\\n\\n“Had you ever seen this lady before?”\\n\\n“Never, monsieur.” And then the girl added diffidently: “But I think\\nshe was English.”\\n\\n“English?”\\n\\n“Yes, monsieur. She asked for M. Renauld in quite good French, but the\\naccent—one can always tell it, _n’est-ce pas?___ Besides when they came\\nout of the study they were speaking in English.”\\n\\n“Did you hear what they said? Could you understand it, I mean?”\\n\\n“Me, I speak the English very well,” said Denise with pride. “The lady\\nwas speaking too fast for me to catch what she said, but I heard\\nMonsieur’s last words as he opened the door for her.” She paused, and\\nthen repeated carefully and laboriously:\\n\\n“\\u200a‘Yeas—yeas—butt for Gaud’s saike go nauw!’\\u200a”\\n\\n“Yes, yes, but for God’s sake go now!” repeated the magistrate.\\n\\nHe dismissed Denise and, after a moment or two for consideration,\\nrecalled Françoise. To her he propounded the question as to whether she\\nhad not made a mistake in fixing the night of Madame Daubreuil’s visit.\\nFrançoise, however, proved unexpectedly obstinate. It was last night\\nthat Madame Daubreuil had come. Without a doubt it was she. Denise\\nwished to make herself interesting, _voilà tout!___ So she had cooked\\nup this fine tale about a strange lady. Airing her knowledge of English\\ntoo! Probably Monsieur had never spoken that sentence in English at\\nall, and even if he had, it proved nothing, for Madame Daubreuil spoke\\nEnglish perfectly, and generally used that language when talking to M.\\nand Madame Renauld. “You see, M. Jack, the son of Monsieur, was usually\\nhere, and he spoke the French very badly.”\\n\\nThe magistrate did not insist. Instead he inquired about the chauffeur,\\nand learned that only yesterday, M. Renauld had declared that he was\\nnot likely to use the car, and that Masters might just as well take a\\nholiday.\\n\\nA perplexed frown was beginning to gather between Poirot’s eyes.\\n\\n“What is it?” I whispered.\\n\\nHe shook his head impatiently, and asked a question:\\n\\n“Pardon, M. Bex, but without doubt M. Renauld could drive the car\\nhimself?”\\n\\nThe commissary looked over at Françoise, and the old woman replied\\npromptly:\\n\\n“No, Monsieur did not drive himself.”\\n\\nPoirot’s frown deepened.\\n\\n“I wish you would tell me what is worrying you,” I said impatiently.\\n\\n“See you not? In his letter M. Renauld speaks of sending the car for me\\nto Calais.”\\n\\n“Perhaps he meant a hired car,” I suggested.\\n\\n“Doubtless that is so. But why hire a car when you have one of your\\nown. Why choose yesterday to send away the chauffeur on a\\nholiday—suddenly, at a moment’s notice? Was it that for some reason he\\nwanted him out of the way before we arrived?”\\n\\n\\n\\n4 The Letter Signed “Bella”\\n\\nFrançoise had left the room. The magistrate was drumming thoughtfully\\non the table.\\n\\n“M. Bex,” he said at length, “here we have directly conflicting\\ntestimony. Which are we to believe, Françoise or Denise?”\\n\\n“Denise,” said the commissary decidedly. “It was she who let the\\nvisitor in. Françoise is old and obstinate, and has evidently taken a\\ndislike to Madame Daubreuil. Besides, our own knowledge tends to show\\nthat Renauld was entangled with another woman.”\\n\\n“_Tiens!___” cried M. Hautet. “We have forgotten to inform M. Poirot of\\nthat.” He searched amongst the papers on the table, and finally handed\\nthe one he was in search of to my friend. “This letter, M. Poirot, we\\nfound in the pocket of the dead man’s overcoat.”\\n\\nPoirot took it and unfolded it. It was somewhat worn and crumbled, and\\nwas written in English in a rather unformed hand:\\n\\n“_My dearest one:___”\\nWhy have you not written for so long? You do love me still, don’t you?\\nYour letters lately have been so different, cold and strange, and now\\nthis long silence. It makes me afraid. If you were to stop loving me!\\nBut that’s impossible—what a silly kid I am—always imagining things!\\nBut if you _did___ stop loving me, I don’t know what I should do—kill\\nmyself perhaps! I couldn’t live without you. Sometimes I fancy another\\nwoman is coming between us. Let her look out, that’s all—and you too!\\nI’d as soon kill you as let her have you! I mean it.\\n    “But there, I’m writing high-flown nonsense. You love me, and I\\n    love you—yes, love you, love you, love you!\\n\\n\\n“Your own adoring\\n“BELLA.”\\n\\n\\nThere was no address or date. Poirot handed it back with a grave face.\\n\\n“And the assumption is, M. le juge—?”\\n\\nThe examining magistrate shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n“Obviously M. Renauld was entangled with this Englishwoman—Bella. He\\ncomes over here, meets Madame Daubreuil, and starts an intrigue with\\nher. He cools off to the other, and she instantly suspects something.\\nThis letter contains a distinct threat. M. Poirot, at first sight the\\ncase seemed simplicity itself. Jealousy! The fact that M. Renauld was\\nstabbed in the back seemed to point distinctly to its being a woman’s\\ncrime.”\\n\\nPoirot nodded.\\n\\n“The stab in the back, yes—but not the grave! That was laborious work,\\nhard work—no woman dug that grave, monsieur. That was a man’s doing.”\\n\\nThe commissary exclaimed excitedly: “Yes, yes, you are right. We did\\nnot think of that.”\\n\\n“As I said,” continued M. Hautet, “at first sight the case seemed\\nsimple, but the masked men, and the letter you received from M. Renauld\\ncomplicate matters. Here we seem to have an entirely different set of\\ncircumstances, with no relationship between the two. As regards the\\nletter written to yourself, do you think it is possible that it\\nreferred in any way to this ‘Bella,’ and her threats?”\\n\\nPoirot shook his head.\\n\\n“Hardly. A man like M. Renauld, who has led an adventurous life in\\nout-of-the-way places, would not be likely to ask for protection\\nagainst a woman.”\\n\\nThe examining magistrate nodded his head emphatically.\\n\\n“My view exactly. Then we must look for the explanation of the letter—”\\n\\n“In Santiago,” finished the commissary. “I shall cable without delay to\\nthe police in that city, requesting full details of the murdered man’s\\nlife out there, his love affairs, his business transactions, his\\nfriendships, and any enmities he may have incurred. It will be strange\\nif, after that, we do not hold a clue to his mysterious murder.”\\n\\nThe commissary looked round for approval.\\n\\n“Excellent,” said Poirot appreciatively.\\n\\n“His wife, too, may be able to give us a pointer,” added the\\nmagistrate.\\n\\n“You have found no other letters from this Bella amongst M. Renauld’s\\neffects?” asked Poirot.\\n\\n“No. Of course one of our first proceedings was to search through his\\nprivate papers in the study. We found nothing of interest, however. All\\nseemed square and above-board. The only thing at all out of the\\nordinary was his will. Here it is.”\\n\\nPoirot ran through the document.\\n\\n“So. A legacy of a thousand pounds to Mr. Stonor—who is he, by the\\nway?”\\n\\n“M. Renauld’s secretary. He remained in England, but was over here once\\nor twice for a week-end.”\\n\\n“And everything else left unconditionally to his beloved wife, Eloise.\\nSimply drawn up, but perfectly legal. Witnessed by the two servants,\\nDenise and Françoise. Nothing so very unusual about that.” He handed it\\nback.\\n\\n“Perhaps,” began Bex, “you did not notice—”\\n\\n“The date?” twinkled Poirot. “But yes, I noticed it. A fortnight ago.\\nPossibly it marks his first intimation of danger. Many rich men die\\nintestate through never considering the likelihood of their demise. But\\nit is dangerous to draw conclusions prematurely. It points, however, to\\nhis having a real liking and fondness for his wife, in spite of his\\namorous intrigues.”\\n\\n“Yes,” said M. Hautet doubtfully. “But it is possibly a little unfair\\non his son, since it leaves him entirely dependent on his mother. If\\nshe were to marry again, and her second husband obtained an ascendancy\\nover her, this boy might never touch a penny of his father’s money.”\\n\\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n“Man is a vain animal. M. Renauld figured to himself, without doubt,\\nthat his widow would never marry again. As to the son, it may have been\\na wise precaution to leave the money in his mother’s hands. The sons of\\nrich men are proverbially wild.”\\n\\n“It may be as you say. Now, M. Poirot, you would without doubt like to\\nvisit the scene of the crime. I am sorry that the body has been\\nremoved, but of course photographs have been taken from every\\nconceivable angle, and will be at your disposal as soon as they are\\navailable.”\\n\\n“I thank you, monsieur, for all your courtesy.”\\n\\nThe commissary rose.\\n\\n“Come with me, monsieurs.”\\n\\nHe opened the door, and bowed ceremoniously to Poirot to precede him.\\nPoirot, with equal politeness, drew back and bowed to the commissary.\\n\\n“Monsieur.”\\n\\n“Monsieur.”\\n\\nAt last they got out into the hall.\\n\\n“That room there, it is the study, _hein?___” asked Poirot suddenly,\\nnodding towards the door opposite.\\n\\n“Yes. You would like to see it?” He threw the door open as he spoke,\\nand we entered.\\n\\nThe room which M. Renauld had chosen for his own particular use was\\nsmall, but furnished with great taste and comfort. A businesslike\\nwriting desk, with many pigeon holes, stood in the window. Two large\\nleather-covered armchairs faced the fireplace, and between them was a\\nround table covered with the latest books and magazines. Bookshelves\\nlined two of the walls, and at the end of the room opposite the window\\nthere was a handsome oak sideboard with a tantalus on top. The curtains\\nand _portière___ were of a soft dull green, and the carpet matched them\\nin tone.\\n\\nPoirot stood a moment talking in the room, then he stepped forward,\\npassed his hand lightly over the backs of the leather chairs, picked up\\na magazine from the table, and drew a finger gingerly over the surface\\nof the oak sideboard. His face expressed complete approval.\\n\\n“No dust?” I asked, with a smile.\\n\\nHe beamed on me, appreciative of my knowledge of his peculiarities.\\n\\n“Not a particle, _mon ami!___ And for once, perhaps, it is a pity.”\\n\\nHis sharp, birdlike eyes darted here and there.\\n\\n“Ah!” he remarked suddenly, with an intonation of relief. “The\\nhearth-rug is crooked,” and he bent down to straighten it.\\n\\nSuddenly he uttered an exclamation and rose. In his hand he held a\\nsmall fragment of paper.\\n\\n“In France, as in England,” he remarked, “the domestics omit to sweep\\nunder the mats!”\\n\\nBex took the fragment from him, and I came closer to examine it.\\n\\n“You recognize it—eh, Hastings?”\\n\\nI shook my head, puzzled—and yet that particular shade of pink paper\\nwas very familiar.\\n\\nThe commissary’s mental processes were quicker than mine.\\n\\n“A fragment of a cheque,” he exclaimed.\\n\\nThe piece of paper was roughly about two inches square. On it was\\nwritten in ink the word “Duveen.”\\n\\n“_Bien___,” said Bex. “This cheque was payable to, or drawn by, one\\nnamed Duveen.”\\n\\n“The former, I fancy,” said Poirot, “for, if I am not mistaken, the\\nhandwriting is that of M. Renauld.”\\n\\nThat was soon established, by comparing it with a memorandum from the\\ndesk.\\n\\n“Dear me,” murmured the commissary, with a crestfallen air, “I really\\ncannot imagine how I came to overlook this.”\\n\\nPoirot laughed.\\n\\n“The moral of that is, always look under the mats! My friend Hastings\\nhere will tell you that anything in the least crooked is a torment to\\nme. As soon as I saw that the hearth-rug was out of the straight, I\\nsaid to myself: ‘_Tiens!___ The leg of the chair caught it in being\\npushed back. Possibly there may be something beneath it which the good\\nFrançoise overlooked.’\\u200a”\\n\\n“Françoise?”\\n\\n“Or Denise, or Léonie. Whoever did this room. Since there is no dust,\\nthe room _must___ have been done this morning. I reconstruct the\\nincident like this. Yesterday, possibly last night, M. Renauld drew a\\ncheque to the order of some one named Duveen. Afterwards it was torn\\nup, and scattered on the floor. This morning—” But M. Bex was already\\npulling impatiently at the bell.\\n\\nFrançoise answered it. Yes, there had been a lot of pieces of paper on\\nthe floor. What had she done with them? Put them in the kitchen stove\\nof course! What else?\\n\\nWith a gesture of despair, Bex dismissed her. Then, his face\\nlightening, he ran to the desk. In a minute he was hunting through the\\ndead man’s cheque book. Then he repeated his former gesture. The last\\ncounterfoil was blank.\\n\\n“Courage!” cried Poirot, clapping him on the back. “Without doubt,\\nMadame Renauld will be able to tell us all about this mysterious person\\nnamed Duveen.”\\n\\nThe commissary’s face cleared. “That is true. Let us proceed.”\\n\\nAs we turned to leave the room, Poirot remarked casually: “It was here\\nthat M. Renauld received his guest last night, eh?”\\n\\n“It was—but how did you know?”\\n\\n“By _this___. I found it on the back of the leather chair.”\\n\\nAnd he held up between his finger and thumb a long black hair—a woman’s\\nhair!\\n\\nM. Bex took us out by the back of the house to where there was a small\\nshed leaning against the house. He produced a key from his pocket and\\nunlocked it.\\n\\n“The body is here. We moved it from the scene of the crime just before\\nyou arrived, as the photographers had done with it.”\\n\\nHe opened the door and we passed in. The murdered man lay on the\\nground, with a sheet over him. M. Bex dexterously whipped off the\\ncovering. Renauld was a man of medium height, slender and lithe in\\nfigure. He looked about fifty years of age, and his dark hair was\\nplentifully streaked with grey. He was clean shaven with a long thin\\nnose, and eyes set rather close together, and his skin was deeply\\nbronzed, as that of a man who had spent most of his life beneath\\ntropical skies. His lips were drawn back from his teeth and an\\nexpression of absolute amazement and terror was stamped on the livid\\nfeatures.\\n\\n“One can see by his face that he was stabbed in the back,” remarked\\nPoirot.\\n\\nVery gently, he turned the dead man over. There, between the\\nshoulder-blades, staining the light fawn overcoat, was a round dark\\npatch. In the middle of it there was a slit in the cloth. Poirot\\nexamined it narrowly.\\n\\n“Have you any idea with what weapon the crime was committed?”\\n\\n“It was left in the wound.” The commissary reached down a large glass\\njar. In it was a small object that looked to me more like a paper-knife\\nthan anything else. It had a black handle, and a narrow shining blade.\\nThe whole thing was not more than ten inches long. Poirot tested the\\ndiscoloured point gingerly with his finger tip.\\n\\n“_Ma foi!___ but it is sharp! A nice easy little tool for murder!”\\n\\n“Unfortunately, we could find no trace of fingerprints on it,” remarked\\nBex regretfully. “The murderer must have worn gloves.”\\n\\n“Of course he did,” said Poirot contemptuously. “Even in Santiago they\\nknow enough for that. The veriest amateur of an English Mees knows\\nit—thanks to the publicity the Bertillon system has been given in the\\nPress. All the same, it interests me very much that there were no\\nfinger-prints. It is so amazingly simple to leave the finger-prints of\\nsome one else! And then the police are happy.” He shook his head. “I\\nvery much fear our criminal is not a man of method—either that or he\\nwas pressed for time. But we shall see.”\\n\\nHe let the body fall back into its original position.\\n\\n“He wore only underclothes under his overcoat, I see,” he remarked.\\n\\n“Yes, the examining magistrate thinks that is rather a curious point.”\\n\\nAt this minute there was a tap on the door which Bex had closed after\\nhim. He strode forward and opened it. Françoise was there. She\\nendeavoured to peep in with ghoulish curiosity.\\n\\n“Well, what is it?” demanded Bex impatiently.\\n\\n“Madame. She sends a message that she is much recovered, and is quite\\nready to receive the examining magistrate.”\\n\\n“Good,” said M. Bex briskly. “Tell M. Hautet and say that we will come\\nat once.”\\n\\nPoirot lingered a moment, looking back towards the body. I thought for\\na moment that he was going to apostrophize it, to declare aloud his\\ndetermination never to rest till he had discovered the murderer. But\\nwhen he spoke, it was tamely and awkwardly, and his comment was\\nludicrously inappropriate to the solemnity of the moment.\\n\\n“He wore his overcoat very long,” he said constrainedly.\\n\\n\\n\\n5 Mrs. Renauld’s Story\\n\\nWe found M. Hautet awaiting us in the hall, and we all proceeded\\nupstairs together, Françoise marching ahead to show us the way. Poirot\\nwent up in a zigzag fashion which puzzled me, until he whispered with a\\ngrimace:\\n\\n“No wonder the servants heard M. Renauld mounting the stairs; not a\\nboard of them but creaks fit to wake the dead!”\\n\\nAt the head of the staircase, a small passage branched off.\\n\\n“The servants’ quarters,” explained Bex.\\n\\nWe continued along a corridor, and Françoise tapped on the last door to\\nthe right of it.\\n\\nA faint voice bade us enter, and we passed into a large sunny apartment\\nlooking out towards the sea, which showed blue and sparkling about a\\nquarter of a mile distant.\\n\\nOn a couch, propped up with cushions, and attended by Dr. Durand, lay a\\ntall, striking-looking woman. She was middle-aged, and her once dark\\nhair was now almost entirely silvered, but the intense vitality and\\nstrength of her personality would have made itself felt anywhere. You\\nknew at once that you were in the presence of what the French call\\n“_une maitresse femme___.”\\n\\nShe greeted us with a dignified inclination of the head.\\n\\n“Pray be seated, monsieurs.”\\n\\nWe took chairs, and the magistrate’s clerk established himself at a\\nround table.\\n\\n“I hope, madame,” began M. Hautet, “that it will not distress you\\nunduly to relate to us what occurred last night?”\\n\\n“Not at all, monsieur. I know the value of time, if these scoundrelly\\nassassins are to be caught and punished.”\\n\\n“Very well, madame. It will fatigue you less, I think, if I ask you\\nquestions and you confine yourself to answering them. At what time did\\nyou go to bed last night?”\\n\\n“At half-past nine, monsieur. I was tired.”\\n\\n“And your husband?”\\n\\n“About an hour later, I fancy.”\\n\\n“Did he seem disturbed—upset in any way?”\\n\\n“No, not more than usual.”\\n\\n“What happened then?”\\n\\n“We slept. I was awakened by a hand being pressed over my mouth. I\\ntried to scream out, but the hand prevented me. There were two men in\\nthe room. They were both masked.”\\n\\n“Can you describe them at all, madame?”\\n\\n“One was very tall, and had a long black beard, the other was short and\\nstout. His beard was reddish. They both wore hats pulled down over\\ntheir eyes.”\\n\\n“H’m,” said the magistrate thoughtfully, “too much beard, I fear.”\\n\\n“You mean they were false?”\\n\\n“Yes, madame. But continue your story.”\\n\\n“It was the short man who was holding me. He forced a gag into my\\nmouth, and then bound me with rope hand and foot. The other man was\\nstanding over my husband. He had caught up my little dagger paper-knife\\nfrom the dressing-table and was holding it with the point just over his\\nheart. When the short man had finished with me, he joined the other,\\nand they forced my husband to get up and accompany them into the\\ndressing-room next door. I was nearly fainting with terror,\\nnevertheless I listened desperately.\\n\\n“They were speaking in too low a tone for me to hear what they said.\\nBut I recognized the language, a bastard Spanish such as is spoken in\\nsome parts of South America. They seemed to be demanding something from\\nmy husband, and presently they grew angry, and their voices rose a\\nlittle. I think the tall man was speaking. ‘You know what we want!’ he\\nsaid. ‘_The secret!___ Where is it?’ I do not know what my husband\\nanswered, but the other replied fiercely: ‘You lie! We know you have\\nit. Where are your keys?’\\n\\n“Then I heard sounds of drawers being pulled out. There is a safe on\\nthe wall of my husband’s dressing-room in which he always keeps a\\nfairly large amount of ready money. Léonie tells me this has been\\nrifled and the money taken, but evidently what they were looking for\\nwas not there, for presently I heard the tall man, with an oath,\\ncommand my husband to dress himself. Soon after that, I think some\\nnoise in the house must have disturbed them, for they hustled my\\nhusband out into my room only half dressed.”\\n\\n“_Pardon___,” interrupted Poirot, “but is there then no other egress\\nfrom the dressing-room?”\\n\\n“No, monsieur, there is only the communicating door into my room. They\\nhurried my husband through, the short man in front, and the tall man\\nbehind him with the dagger still in his hand. Paul tried to break away\\nto come to me. I saw his agonized eyes. He turned to his captors. ‘I\\nmust speak to her,’ he said. Then, coming to the side of the bed, ‘It\\nis all right, Eloise,’ he said. ‘Do not be afraid. I shall return\\nbefore morning.’ But, although he tried to make his voice confident, I\\ncould see the terror in his eyes. Then they hustled him out of the\\ndoor, the tall man saying: ‘One sound—and you are a dead man,\\nremember.’\\n\\n“After that,” continued Mrs. Renauld, “I must have fainted. The next\\nthing I recollect is Léonie rubbing my wrists, and giving me brandy.”\\n\\n“Madame Renauld,” said the magistrate, “had you any idea what it was\\nfor which the assassins were searching?”\\n\\n“None whatever, monsieur.”\\n\\n“Had you any knowledge that your husband feared something?”\\n\\n“Yes. I had seen the change in him.”\\n\\n“How long ago was that?”\\n\\nMrs. Renauld reflected.\\n\\n“Ten days perhaps.”\\n\\n“Not longer?”\\n\\n“Possibly. I only noticed it then.”\\n\\n“Did you question your husband at all as to the cause?”\\n\\n“Once. He put me off evasively. Nevertheless, I was convinced that he\\nwas suffering some terrible anxiety. However, since he evidently wished\\nto conceal the fact from me, I tried to pretend that I had noticed\\nnothing.”\\n\\n“Were you aware that he had called in the services of a detective?”\\n\\n“A detective?” exclaimed Mrs. Renauld, very much surprised.\\n\\n“Yes, this gentleman—M. Hercule Poirot.” Poirot bowed. “He arrived\\ntoday in response to a summons from your husband.” And taking the\\nletter written by M. Renauld from his pocket he handed it to the lady.\\n\\nShe read it with apparently genuine astonishment.\\n\\n“I had no idea of this. Evidently he was fully cognizant of the\\ndanger.”\\n\\n“Now, madame, I will beg of you to be frank with me. Is there any\\nincident in your husband’s past life in South America which might throw\\nlight on his murder?”\\n\\nMrs. Renauld reflected deeply, but at last shook her head.\\n\\n“I can think of none. Certainly my husband had many enemies, people he\\nhad got the better of in some way or another, but I can think of no one\\ndistinctive case. I do not say there is no such incident—only that I am\\nnot aware of it.”\\n\\nThe examining magistrate stroked his beard disconsolately.\\n\\n“And you can fix the time of this outrage?”\\n\\n“Yes, I distinctly remember hearing the clock on the mantelpiece strike\\ntwo.” She nodded towards an eight-day travelling clock in a leather\\ncase which stood in the centre of the chimney-piece.\\n\\nPoirot rose from his seat, scrutinized the clock carefully, and nodded,\\nsatisfied.\\n\\n“And here too,” exclaimed M. Bex, “is a wrist watch, knocked off the\\ndressing-table by the assassins, without doubt, and smashed to atoms.\\nLittle did they know it would testify against them.”\\n\\nGently he picked away the fragments of broken glass. Suddenly his face\\nchanged to one of utter stupefaction.\\n\\n“_Mon Dieu!___” he ejaculated.\\n\\n“What is it?”\\n\\n“The hands of the watch point to seven o’clock!”\\n\\n“What?” cried the examining magistrate, astonished.\\n\\nBut Poirot, deft as ever, took the broken trinket from the startled\\ncommissary, and held it to his ear. Then he smiled.\\n\\n“The glass is broken, yes, but the watch itself is still going.”\\n\\nThe explanation of the mystery was greeted with a relieved smile. But\\nthe magistrate bethought him of another point.\\n\\n“But surely it is not seven o’clock now?”\\n\\n“No,” said Poirot gently, “it is a few minutes after five. Possibly the\\nwatch gains, is that so, madame?”\\n\\nMrs. Renauld was frowning perplexedly.\\n\\n“It does gain,” she admitted, “but I’ve never known it to gain quite so\\nmuch as that.”\\n\\nWith a gesture of impatience, the magistrate left the matter of the\\nwatch and proceeded with his interrogatory.\\n\\n“Madame, the front door was found ajar. It seems almost certain that\\nthe murderers entered that way, yet it has not been forced at all. Can\\nyou suggest any explanation?”\\n\\n“Possibly my husband went out for a stroll the last thing, and forgot\\nto latch it when he came in.”\\n\\n“Is that a likely thing to happen?”\\n\\n“Very. My husband was the most absent-minded of men.”\\n\\nThere was a slight frown on her brow as she spoke, as though this trait\\nin the dead man’s character had at times vexed her.\\n\\n“There is one inference I think we might draw,” remarked the commissary\\nsuddenly. “Since the men insisted on M. Renauld dressing himself, it\\nlooks as though the place they were taking him to, the place where ‘the\\nsecret’ was concealed, lay some distance away.”\\n\\nThe magistrate nodded.\\n\\n“Yes, far, and yet not too far, since he spoke of being back by\\nmorning.”\\n\\n“What times does the last train leave the station of Merlinville?”\\nasked Poirot.\\n\\n“Eleven-fifty one way, and 12:17 the other, but it is more probable\\nthat they had a motor waiting.”\\n\\n“Of course,” agreed Poirot, looking somewhat crestfallen.\\n\\n“Indeed, that might be one way of tracing them,” continued the\\nmagistrate, brightening. “A motor containing two foreigners is quite\\nlikely to have been noticed. That is an excellent point, M. Bex.”\\n\\nHe smiled to himself, and then, becoming grave once more, he said to\\nMrs. Renauld:\\n\\n“There is another question. Do you know any one of the name of\\n‘Duveen’?”\\n\\n“Duveen?” Mrs. Renauld repeated, thoughtfully. “No, for the moment, I\\ncannot say I do.”\\n\\n“You have never heard your husband mention any one of that name?”\\n\\n“Never.”\\n\\n“Do you know any one whose Christian name is Bella?”\\n\\nHe watched Mrs. Renauld narrowly as he spoke, seeking to surprise any\\nsigns of anger or consciousness, but she merely shook her head in quite\\na natural manner. He continued his questions.\\n\\n“Are you aware that your husband had a visitor last night?”\\n\\nNow he saw the red mount slightly in her cheeks, but she replied\\ncomposedly.\\n\\n“No, who was that?”\\n\\n“A lady.”\\n\\n“Indeed?”\\n\\nBut for the moment the magistrate was content to say no more. It seemed\\nunlikely that Madame Daubreuil had any connection with the crime, and\\nhe was anxious not to upset Mrs. Renauld more than necessary.\\n\\nHe made a sign to the commissary, and the latter replied with a nod.\\nThen rising, he went across the room, and returned with the glass jar\\nwe had seen in the outhouse in his hand. From this, he took the dagger.\\n\\n“Madame,” he said gently, “do you recognize this?”\\n\\nShe gave a little cry.\\n\\n“Yes, that is my little dagger.” Then—she saw the stained point, and\\nshe drew back, her eyes widening with horror. “Is that—blood?”\\n\\n“Yes, madame. Your husband was killed with this weapon.” He removed it\\nhastily from sight. “You are quite sure about it’s being the one that\\nwas on your dressing-table last night?”\\n\\n“Oh, yes. It was a present from my son. He was in the Air Force during\\nthe War. He gave his age as older than it was.” There was a touch of\\nthe proud mother in her voice. “This was made from a streamline\\naeroplane wire, and was given to me by my son as a souvenir of the\\nWar.”\\n\\n“I see, madame. That brings us to another matter. Your son, where is he\\nnow? It is necessary that he should be telegraphed to without delay.”\\n\\n“Jack? He is on his way to Buenos Ayres.”\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“Yes. My husband telegraphed to him yesterday. He had sent him on\\nbusiness to Paris, but yesterday he discovered that it would be\\nnecessary for him to proceed without delay to South America. There was\\na boat leaving Cherbourg for Buenos Ayres last night, and he wired him\\nto catch it.”\\n\\n“Have you any knowledge of what the business in Buenos Ayres was?”\\n\\n“No, monsieur, I know nothing of its nature, but Buenos Ayres is not my\\nson’s final destination. He was going overland from there to Santiago.”\\n\\nAnd, in unison, the magistrate and the commissary exclaimed:\\n\\n“Santiago! Again Santiago!”\\n\\nIt was at this moment, when we were all stunned by the mention of that\\nword, that Poirot approached Mrs. Renauld. He had been standing by the\\nwindow like a man lost in a dream, and I doubt if he had fully taken in\\nwhat had passed. He paused by the lady’s side with a bow.\\n\\n“_Pardon___, madame, but may I examine your wrists.”\\n\\nThough slightly surprised at the request, Mrs. Renauld held them out to\\nhim. Round each of them was a cruel red mark where the cords had bitten\\ninto the flesh. As he examined them, I fancied that a momentary flicker\\nof excitement I had seen in his eyes disappeared.\\n\\n“They must cause you great pain,” he said, and once more he looked\\npuzzled.\\n\\nBut the magistrate was speaking excitedly.\\n\\n“Young M. Renauld must be communicated with at once by wireless. It is\\nvital that we should know anything he can tell us about this trip to\\nSantiago.” He hesitated. “I hoped he might have been near at hand, so\\nthat we could have saved you pain, madame.” He paused.\\n\\n“You mean,” she said in a low voice, “the identification of my\\nhusband’s body?”\\n\\nThe magistrate bowed his head.\\n\\n“I am a strong woman, monsieur. I can bear all that is required of me.\\nI am ready—now.”\\n\\n“Oh, tomorrow will be quite soon enough, I assure you—”\\n\\n“I prefer to get it over,” she said in a low tone, a spasm of pain\\ncrossing her face. “If you will be so good as to give me your arm,\\nDoctor?”\\n\\nThe doctor hastened forward, a cloak was thrown over Mrs. Renauld’s\\nshoulders, and a slow procession went down the stairs. M. Bex hurried\\non ahead to open the door of the shed. In a minute or two Mrs. Renauld\\nappeared in the doorway. She was very pale, but resolute. Behind her,\\nM. Hautet was clacking commiserations and apologies like an animated\\nhen.\\n\\nShe raised her hand to her face.\\n\\n“A moment, messieurs, while I steel myself.”\\n\\nShe took her hand away and looked down at the dead man. Then the\\nmarvellous self-control which had upheld her so far deserted her.\\n\\n“Paul!” she cried. “Husband! Oh, God!” And pitching forward she fell\\nunconscious to the ground.\\n\\nInstantly Poirot was beside her, he raised the lid of her eye, felt her\\npulse. When he had satisfied himself that she had really fainted, he\\ndrew aside. He caught me by the arm.\\n\\n“I am an imbecile, my friend! If ever there was love and grief in a\\nwoman’s voice, I heard it then. My little idea was all wrong. _Eh\\nbien!___ I must start again!”\\n\\n\\n\\n6 The Scene of the Crime\\n\\nBetween them, the doctor and M. Hautet carried the unconscious woman\\ninto the house. The commissary looked after them, shaking his head.\\n\\n“_Pauvre femme___,” he murmured to himself. “The shock was too much for\\nher. Well, well, we can do nothing. Now, M. Poirot, shall we visit the\\nplace where the crime was committed?”\\n\\n“If you please, M. Bex.”\\n\\nWe passed through the house, and out by the front door. Poirot had\\nlooked up at the staircase in passing, and shook his head in a\\ndissatisfied manner.\\n\\n“It is to me incredible that the servants heard nothing. The creaking\\nof that staircase, with _three___ people descending it, would awaken\\nthe dead!”\\n\\n“It was the middle of the night, remember. They were sound asleep by\\nthen.”\\n\\nBut Poirot continued to shake his head as though not fully accepting\\nthe explanation. On the sweep of the drive, he paused, looking up at\\nthe house.\\n\\n“What moved them in the first place to try if the front door were open?\\nIt was a most unlikely thing that it should be. It was far more\\nprobable that they should at once try to force a window.”\\n\\n“But all the windows on the ground floor are barred with iron\\nshutters,” objected the commissary.\\n\\nPoirot pointed to a window on the first floor.\\n\\n“That is the window of the bedroom we have just come from, is it not?\\nAnd see—there is a tree by which it would be the easiest thing in the\\nworld to mount.”\\n\\n“Possibly,” admitted the other. “But they could not have done so\\nwithout leaving footprints in the flower-bed.”\\n\\nI saw the justice of his words. There were two large oval flower-beds\\nplanted with scarlet geraniums, one each side of the steps leading up\\nto the front door. The tree in question had its roots actually at the\\nback of the bed itself, and it would have been impossible to reach it\\nwithout stepping on the bed.\\n\\n“You see,” continued the commissary, “owing to the dry weather no\\nprints would show on the drive or paths; but, on the soft mould of the\\nflower-bed, it would have been a very different affair.”\\n\\nPoirot went close to the bed and studied it attentively. As Bex had\\nsaid, the mould was perfectly smooth. There was not an indentation on\\nit anywhere.\\n\\nPoirot nodded, as though convinced, and we turned away, but he suddenly\\ndarted off and began examining the other flower-bed.\\n\\n“M. Bex!” he called. “See here. Here are plenty of traces for you.”\\n\\nThe commissary joined him—and smiled.\\n\\n“My dear M. Poirot, those are without doubt the footprints of the\\ngardener’s large hobnailed boots. In any case, it would have no\\nimportance, since this side we have no tree, and consequently no means\\nof gaining access to the upper story.”\\n\\n“True,” said Poirot, evidently crestfallen. “So you think these\\nfootprints are of no importance?”\\n\\n“Not the least in the world.”\\n\\nThen, to my utter astonishment, Poirot pronounced these words:\\n\\n“I do not agree with you. I have a little idea that these footprints\\nare the most important things we have seen yet.”\\n\\nM. Bex said nothing, merely shrugged his shoulders. He was far too\\ncourteous to utter his real opinion.\\n\\n“Shall we proceed?” he asked instead.\\n\\n“Certainly. I can investigate this matter of the footprints later,”\\nsaid Poirot cheerfully.\\n\\nInstead of following the drive down to the gate, M. Bex turned up a\\npath that branched off at right angles. It led, up a slight incline,\\nround to the right of the house, and was bordered on either side by a\\nkind of shrubbery. Suddenly it emerged into a little clearing from\\nwhich one obtained a view of the sea. A seat had been placed here, and\\nnot far from it was a rather ramshackle shed. A few steps further on, a\\nneat line of small bushes marked the boundary of the Villa grounds. M.\\nBex pushed his way through these and we found ourselves on a wide\\nstretch of open downs. I looked round, and saw something that filled me\\nwith astonishment.\\n\\n“Why, this is a golf course,” I cried.\\n\\nBex nodded.\\n\\n“The limits are not completed yet,” he explained. “It is hoped to be\\nable to open them sometime next month. It was some of the men working\\non them who discovered the body early this morning.”\\n\\nI gave a gasp. A little to my left, where for the moment I had\\noverlooked it, was a long narrow pit, and by it, face downwards, was\\nthe body of a man! For a moment, my heart gave a terrible leap, and I\\nhad a wild fancy that the tragedy had been duplicated. But the\\ncommissary dispelled my illusion by moving forward with a sharp\\nexclamation of annoyance:\\n\\n“What have my police been about? They had strict orders to allow no one\\nnear the place without proper credentials!”\\n\\nThe man on the ground turned his head over his shoulder.\\n\\n“But I have proper credentials,” he remarked, and rose slowly to his\\nfeet.\\n\\n“My dear M. Giraud,” cried the commissary. “I had no idea that you had\\narrived, even. The examining magistrate has been awaiting you with the\\nutmost impatience.”\\n\\nAs he spoke, I was scanning the new-comer with the keenest curiosity.\\nThe famous detective from the Paris Sûreté was familiar to me by name,\\nand I was extremely interested to see him in the flesh. He was very\\ntall, perhaps about thirty years of age, with auburn hair and\\nmoustache, and a military carriage. There was a trace of arrogance in\\nhis manner which showed that he was fully alive to his own importance.\\nBex introduced us, presenting Poirot as a colleague. A flicker of\\ninterest came into the detective’s eye.\\n\\n“I know you by name, M. Poirot,” he said. “You cut quite a figure in\\nthe old days, didn’t you? But methods are very different now.”\\n\\n“Crimes, though, are very much the same,” remarked Poirot gently.\\n\\nI saw at once that Giraud was prepared to be hostile. He resented the\\nother being associated with him, and I felt that if he came across any\\nclue of importance he would be more than likely to keep it to himself.\\n\\n“The examining magistrate—” began Bex again. But Giraud interrupted him\\nrudely:\\n\\n“A fig for the examining magistrate! The light is the important thing.\\nFor all practical purposes it will be gone in another half-hour or so.\\nI know all about the case, and the people at the house will do very\\nwell until tomorrow, but, if we’re going to find a clue to the\\nmurderers, here is the spot we shall find it. Is it your police who\\nhave been trampling all over the place? I thought they knew better\\nnowadays.”\\n\\n“Assuredly they do. The marks you complain of were made by the workmen\\nwho discovered the body.”\\n\\nThe other grunted disgustedly.\\n\\n“I can see the tracks where the three of them came through the\\nhedge—but they were cunning. You can just recognize the centre\\nfootmarks as those of M. Renauld, but those on either side have been\\ncarefully obliterated. Not that there would really be much to see\\nanyway on this hard ground, but they weren’t taking any chances.”\\n\\n“The external sign,” said Poirot. “That is what you seek, eh?”\\n\\nThe other detective stared.\\n\\n“Of course.”\\n\\nA very faint smile came to Poirot’s lips. He seemed about to speak, but\\nchecked himself. He bent down to where a spade was lying.\\n\\n“That’s what the grave was dug with, right enough,” said Giraud. “But\\nyou’ll get nothing from it. It was Renauld’s own spade, and the man who\\nused it wore gloves. Here they are.” He gesticulated with his foot to\\nwhere two soiled earth-stained gloves were lying. “And they’re\\nRenauld’s too—or at least his gardener’s. I tell you, the men who\\nplanned out this crime were taking no chances. The man was stabbed with\\nhis own dagger, and would have been buried with his own spade. They\\ncounted on leaving no traces! But I’ll beat them. There’s always\\n_something!___ And I mean to find it.”\\n\\nBut Poirot was now apparently interested in something else, a short\\ndiscoloured piece of lead-piping which lay beside the spade. He touched\\nit delicately with his finger.\\n\\n“And does this, too, belong to the murdered man?” he asked, and I\\nthought I detected a subtle flavour of irony in the question.\\n\\nGiraud shrugged his shoulders to indicate that he neither knew nor\\ncared.\\n\\n“May have been lying around here for weeks. Anyway, it doesn’t interest\\nme.”\\n\\n“I, on the contrary, find it very interesting,” said Poirot sweetly.\\n\\nI guessed that he was merely bent on annoying the Paris detective and,\\nif so, he succeeded. The other turned away rudely, remarking that he\\nhad no time to waste, and bending down he resumed his minute search of\\nthe ground.\\n\\nMeanwhile Poirot, as though struck by a sudden idea, stepped back over\\nthe boundary, and tried the door of the little shed.\\n\\n“That’s locked,” said Giraud over his shoulder. “But it’s only a place\\nwhere the gardener keeps his rubbish. The spade didn’t come from there,\\nbut from the toolshed up by the house.”\\n\\n“Marvellous,” murmured M. Bex, to me ecstatically. “He has been here\\nbut half an hour, and he already knows everything! What a man!\\nUndoubtedly Giraud is the greatest detective alive today.”\\n\\nAlthough I disliked the detective heartily, I nevertheless was secretly\\nimpressed. Efficiency seemed to radiate from the man. I could not help\\nfeeling that, so far, Poirot had not greatly distinguished himself, and\\nit vexed me. He seemed to be directing his attention to all sorts of\\nsilly, puerile points that had nothing to do with the case. Indeed, at\\nthis juncture, he suddenly asked:\\n\\n“M. Bex, tell me, I pray you, the meaning of this whitewashed line that\\nextends all round the grave. Is it a device of the police?”\\n\\n“No, M. Poirot, it is an affair of the golf course. It shows that there\\nis here to be a ‘bunkair,’ as you call it.”\\n\\n“A bunkair?” Poirot turned to me. “That is the irregular hole filled\\nwith sand and a bank at one side, is it not?”\\n\\nI concurred.\\n\\n“You do not play the golf, M. Poirot?” inquired Bex.\\n\\n“I? Never! What a game!” He became excited. “Figure to yourself, each\\nhole it is of a different length. The obstacles, they are not arranged\\nmathematically. Even the greens are frequently up one side! There is\\nonly one pleasing thing—the how do you call them?—tee boxes! They, at\\nleast, are symmetrical.”\\n\\nI could not refrain from a laugh at the way the game appeared to\\nPoirot, and my little friend smiled at me affectionately, bearing no\\nmalice. Then he asked:\\n\\n“But M. Renauld, without doubt he played the golf?”\\n\\n“Yes, he was a keen golfer. It’s mainly owing to him, and to his large\\nsubscriptions, that this work is being carried forward. He even had a\\nsay in the designing of it.”\\n\\nPoirot nodded thoughtfully.\\n\\nThen he remarked:\\n\\n“It was not a very good choice they made—of a spot to bury the body?\\nWhen the men began to dig up the ground, all would have been\\ndiscovered.”\\n\\n“Exactly,” cried Giraud triumphantly. “And that _proves___ that they\\nwere strangers to the place. It’s an excellent piece of indirect\\nevidence.”\\n\\n“Yes,” said Poirot doubtfully. “No one who knew would bury a body\\nthere—unless—unless—they _wanted___ it to be discovered. And that is\\nclearly absurd, is it not?”\\n\\nGiraud did not even trouble to reply.\\n\\n“Yes,” said Poirot, in a somewhat dissatisfied voice.\\n“Yes—undoubtedly—absurd!”\\n\\n\\n\\n7 The Mysterious Madame Daubreuil\\n\\nAs we retraced our steps to the house, M. Bex excused himself for\\nleaving us, explaining that he must immediately acquaint the examining\\nmagistrate with the fact of Giraud’s arrival. Giraud himself had been\\nobviously delighted when Poirot declared that he had seen all he\\nwanted. The last thing we observed, as we left the spot, was Giraud,\\ncrawling about on all fours, with a thoroughness in his search that I\\ncould not but admire. Poirot guessed my thoughts, for as soon as we\\nwere alone he remarked ironically:\\n\\n“At last you have seen the detective you admire—the human foxhound! Is\\nit not so, my friend?”\\n\\n“At any rate, he’s _doing___ something,” I said, with asperity. “If\\nthere’s anything to find, he’ll find it. Now you—”\\n\\n“_Eh bien!___ I also have found something! A piece of lead-piping.”\\n\\n“Nonsense, Poirot. You know very well that’s got nothing to do with it.\\nI meant _little___ things—traces that may lead us infallibly to the\\nmurderers.”\\n\\n“_Mon ami___, a clue of two feet long is every bit as valuable as one\\nmeasuring two millimetres! But it is the romantic idea that all\\nimportant clues must be infinitesimal! As to the piece of lead-piping\\nhaving nothing to do with the crime, you say that because Giraud told\\nyou so. No”—as I was about to interpose a question—“we will say no\\nmore. Leave Giraud to his search, and me to my ideas. The case seems\\nstraightforward enough—and yet—and yet, _mon ami___, I am not\\nsatisfied! And do you know why? Because of the wrist watch that is two\\nhours fast. And then there are several curious little points that do\\nnot seem to fit in. For instance, if the object of the murderers was\\nrevenge, why did they not stab Renauld in his sleep and have done with\\nit?”\\n\\n“They wanted the ‘secret,’\\u200a” I reminded him.\\n\\nPoirot brushed a speck of dust from his sleeve with a dissatisfied air.\\n\\n“Well, where is this ‘secret’? Presumably some distance away, since\\nthey wish him to dress himself. Yet he is found murdered close at hand,\\nalmost within ear-shot of the house. Then again, it is pure chance that\\na weapon such as the dagger should be lying about casually, ready to\\nhand.”\\n\\nHe paused frowning, and then went on:\\n\\n“Why did the servants hear nothing? Were they drugged? Was there an\\naccomplice and did that accomplice see to it that the front door should\\nremain open? I wonder if—”\\n\\nHe stopped abruptly. We had reached the drive in front of the house.\\nSuddenly he turned to me.\\n\\n“My friend, I am about to surprise you—to please you! I have taken your\\nreproaches to heart! We will examine some footprints!”\\n\\n“Where?”\\n\\n“In that right-hand bed yonder. M. Bex says that they are the footmarks\\nof the gardener. Let us see if that is so. See, he approaches with his\\nwheelbarrow.”\\n\\nIndeed an elderly man was just crossing the drive with a barrowful of\\nseedlings. Poirot called to him, and he set down the barrow and came\\nhobbling towards us.\\n\\n“You are going to ask him for one of his boots to compare with the\\nfootmarks?” I asked breathlessly. My faith in Poirot revived a little.\\nSince he said the footprints in this right-hand bed were important,\\npresumably they _were___.\\n\\n“Exactly,” said Poirot.\\n\\n“But won’t he think it very odd?”\\n\\n“He will not think about it at all.”\\n\\nWe could say no more, for the old man had joined us.\\n\\n“You want me for something, monsieur?”\\n\\n“Yes. You have been gardener here a long time, haven’t you?”\\n\\n“Twenty-four years, monsieur.”\\n\\n“And your name is—?”\\n\\n“Auguste, monsieur.”\\n\\n“I was admiring these magnificent geraniums. They are truly superb.\\nThey have been planted long?”\\n\\n“Some time, monsieur. But of course, to keep the beds looking smart,\\none must keep bedding out a few new plants, and remove those that are\\nover, besides keeping the old blooms well picked off.”\\n\\n“You put in some new plants yesterday, didn’t you? Those in the middle\\nthere, and in the other bed also?”\\n\\n“Monsieur has a sharp eye. It takes always a day or so for them to\\n‘pick up.’ Yes, I put ten new plants in each bed last night. As\\nMonsieur doubtless knows, one should not put in plants when the sun is\\nhot.”\\n\\nAuguste was charmed with Poirot’s interest, and was quite inclined to\\nbe garrulous.\\n\\n“That is a splendid specimen there,” said Poirot, pointing. “Might I\\nperhaps have a cutting of it?”\\n\\n“But certainly, monsieur.” The old fellow stepped into the bed, and\\ncarefully took a slip from the plant Poirot had admired.\\n\\nPoirot was profuse in his thanks, and Auguste departed to his barrow.\\n\\n“You see?” said Poirot with a smile, as he bent over the bed to examine\\nthe indentation of the gardener’s hobnailed boot. “It is quite simple.”\\n\\n“I did not realize—”\\n\\n“That the foot would be inside the boot? You do not use your excellent\\nmental capacities sufficiently. Well, what of the footmark?”\\n\\nI examined the bed carefully.\\n\\n“All the footmarks in the bed were made by the same boot,” I said at\\nlength after a careful study.\\n\\n“You think so? _Eh bien___, I agree with you,” said Poirot.\\n\\nHe seemed quite uninterested, and as though he were thinking of\\nsomething else.\\n\\n“At any rate,” I remarked, “you will have one bee less in your bonnet\\nnow.”\\n\\n“_Mon Dieu!___ But what an idiom! What does it mean?”\\n\\n“What I meant was that now you will give up your interest in these\\nfootmarks.”\\n\\nBut to my surprise Poirot shook his head.\\n\\n“No, no, _mon ami___. At last I am on the right track. I am still in\\nthe dark, but, as I hinted just now to M. Bex, these footmarks are the\\nmost important and interesting things in the case! That poor Giraud—I\\nshould not be surprised if he took no notice of them whatever.”\\n\\nAt that moment, the front door opened, and M. Hautet and the commissary\\ncame down the steps.\\n\\n“Ah, M. Poirot, we were coming to look for you,” said the magistrate.\\n“It is getting late, but I wish to pay a visit to Madame Daubreuil.\\nWithout doubt she will be very much upset by M. Renauld’s death, and we\\nmay be fortunate enough to get a clue from her. The secret that he did\\nnot confide to his wife, it is possible that he may have told it to the\\nwoman whose love held him enslaved. We know where our Samsons are weak,\\ndon’t we?”\\n\\nI admired the picturesqueness of M. Hautet’s language. I suspected that\\nthe examining magistrate was by now thoroughly enjoying his part in the\\nmysterious drama.\\n\\n“Is M. Giraud not going to accompany us?” asked Poirot.\\n\\n“M. Giraud has shown clearly that he prefers to conduct the case in his\\nown way,” said M. Hautet dryly. One could see easily enough that\\nGiraud’s cavalier treatment of the examining magistrate had not\\nprejudiced the latter in his favour. We said no more, but fell into\\nline. Poirot walked with the examining magistrate, and the commissary\\nand I followed a few paces behind.\\n\\n“There is no doubt that Françoise’s story is substantially correct,” he\\nremarked to me in a confidential tone. “I have been telephoning\\nheadquarters. It seems that three times in the last six weeks—that is\\nto say since the arrival of M. Renauld at Merlinville—Madame Daubreuil\\nhas paid a large sum in notes into her banking account. Altogether the\\nsum totals two hundred thousand francs!”\\n\\n“Dear me,” I said, considering, “that must be something like four\\nthousand pounds!”\\n\\n“Precisely. Yes, there can be no doubt that he was absolutely\\ninfatuated. But it remains to be seen whether he confided his secret to\\nher. The examining magistrate is hopeful, but I hardly share his\\nviews.”\\n\\nDuring this conversation we were walking down the lane towards the fork\\nin the road where our car had halted earlier in the afternoon, and in\\nanother moment I realized that the Villa Marguerite, the home of the\\nmysterious Madame Daubreuil, was the small house from which the\\nbeautiful girl had emerged.\\n\\n“She has lived here for many years,” said the commissary, nodding his\\nhead towards the house. “Very quietly, very unobtrusively. She seems to\\nhave no friends or relations other than the acquaintances she has made\\nin Merlinville. She never refers to the past, nor to her husband. One\\ndoes not even know if he is alive or dead. There is a mystery about\\nher, you comprehend.” I nodded, my interest growing.\\n\\n“And—the daughter?” I ventured.\\n\\n“A truly beautiful young girl—modest, devout, all that she should be.\\nOne pities her, for, though she may know nothing of the past, a man who\\nwants to ask her hand in marriage must necessarily inform himself, and\\nthen—” The commissary shrugged his shoulders cynically.\\n\\n“But it would not be her fault!” I cried, with rising indignation.\\n\\n“No. But what will you? A man is particular about his wife’s\\nantecedents.”\\n\\nI was prevented from further argument by our arrival at the door. M.\\nHautet rang the bell. A few minutes elapsed, and then we heard a\\nfootfall within, and the door was opened. On the threshold stood my\\nyoung goddess of that afternoon. When she saw us, the colour left her\\ncheeks, leaving her deathly white, and her eyes widened with\\napprehension. There was no doubt about it, she was afraid!\\n\\n“Mademoiselle Daubreuil,” said M. Hautet, sweeping off his hat, “we\\nregret infinitely to disturb you, but the exigencies of the Law—you\\ncomprehend? My compliments to Madame your mother, and will she have the\\ngoodness to grant me a few moments’ interview.”\\n\\nFor a moment the girl stood motionless. Her left hand was pressed to\\nher side, as though to still the sudden unconquerable agitation of her\\nheart. But she mastered herself, and said in a low voice:\\n\\n“I will go and see. Please come inside.”\\n\\nShe entered a room on the left of the hall, and we heard the low murmur\\nof her voice. And then another voice, much the same in timbre, but with\\na slightly harder inflection behind its mellow roundness said:\\n\\n“But certainly. Ask them to enter.”\\n\\nIn another minute we were face to face with the mysterious Madame\\nDaubreuil.\\n\\nShe was not nearly so tall as her daughter, and the rounded curves of\\nher figure had all the grace of full maturity. Her hair, again unlike\\nher daughter’s, was dark, and parted in the middle in the madonna\\nstyle. Her eyes, half hidden by the drooping lids, were blue. There was\\na dimple in the round chin, and the half parted lips seemed always to\\nhover on the verge of a mysterious smile. There was something almost\\nexaggeratedly feminine about her, at once yielding and seductive.\\nThough very well preserved, she was certainly no longer young, but her\\ncharm was of the quality which is independent of age.\\n\\nStanding there, in her black dress with the fresh white collar and\\ncuffs, her hands clasped together, she looked subtly appealing and\\nhelpless.\\n\\n“You wished to see me, monsieur?” she asked.\\n\\n“Yes, madame.” M. Hautet cleared his throat. “I am investigating the\\ndeath of M. Renauld. You have heard of it, no doubt?”\\n\\nShe bowed her head without speaking. Her expression did not change.\\n\\n“We came to ask you whether you can—er—throw any light upon the\\ncircumstances surrounding it?”\\n\\n“I?” The surprise of her tone was excellent.\\n\\n“Yes, madame. It would, perhaps, be better if we could speak to you\\nalone.” He looked meaningly in the direction of the girl.\\n\\nMadame Daubreuil turned to her.\\n\\n“Marthe, dear—”\\n\\nBut the girl shook her head.\\n\\n“No, _maman___, I will not go. I am not a child. I am twenty-two. I\\nshall not go.”\\n\\nMadame Daubreuil turned back to the examining magistrate.\\n\\n“You see, monsieur.”\\n\\n“I should prefer not to speak before Mademoiselle Daubreuil.”\\n\\n“As my daughter says, she is not a child.”\\n\\nFor a moment the magistrate hesitated, baffled.\\n\\n“Very well, madame,” he said at last. “Have it your own way. We have\\nreason to believe that you were in the habit of visiting the dead man\\nat his Villa in the evenings. Is that so?”\\n\\nThe colour rose in the lady’s pale cheeks, but she replied quietly:\\n\\n“I deny your right to ask me such a question!”\\n\\n“Madame, we are investigating a murder.”\\n\\n“Well, what of it? I had nothing to do with the murder.”\\n\\n“Madame, we do not say that for a moment. But you knew the dead man\\nwell. Did he ever confide in you as to any danger that threatened him?”\\n\\n“Never.”\\n\\n“Did he ever mention his life in Santiago, and any enemies he may have\\nmade there?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“Then you can give us no help at all?”\\n\\n“I fear not. I really do not see why you should come to me. Cannot his\\nwife tell you what you want to know?” Her voice held a slender\\ninflection of irony.\\n\\n“Madame Renauld has told us all she can.”\\n\\n“Ah!” said Madame Daubreuil. “I wonder—”\\n\\n“You wonder what, madame?”\\n\\n“Nothing.”\\n\\nThe examining magistrate looked at her. He was aware that he was\\nfighting a duel, and that he had no mean antagonist.\\n\\n“You persist in your statement that M. Renauld confided nothing in\\nyou?”\\n\\n“Why should you think it likely that he should confide in me?”\\n\\n“Because, madame,” said M. Hautet, with calculated brutality. “A man\\ntells to his mistress what he does not always tell to his wife.”\\n\\n“Ah!” she sprang forward. Her eyes flashed fire. “Monsieur, you insult\\nme! And before my daughter! I can tell you nothing. Have the goodness\\nto leave my house!”\\n\\nThe honours undoubtedly rested with the lady. We left the Villa\\nMarguerite like a shamefaced pack of schoolboys. The magistrate\\nmuttered angry ejaculations to himself. Poirot seemed lost in thought.\\nSuddenly he came out of his reverie with a start, and inquired of M.\\nHautet if there was a good hotel near at hand.\\n\\n“There is a small place, the Hotel des Bains, on this side of town. A\\nfew hundred yards down the road. It will be handy for your\\ninvestigations. We shall see you in the morning then, I presume?”\\n\\n“Yes, I thank you, M. Hautet.”\\n\\nWith mutual civilities, we parted company, Poirot and I going towards\\nMerlinville, and the others returning to the Villa Geneviève.\\n\\n“The French police system is very marvellous,” said Poirot, looking\\nafter them. “The information they possess about every one’s life, down\\nto the most commonplace detail, is extraordinary. Though he has only\\nbeen here a little over six weeks, they are perfectly well acquainted\\nwith M. Renauld’s tastes and pursuits, and at a moment’s notice they\\ncan produce information as to Madame Daubreuil’s banking account, and\\nthe sums that have lately been paid in! Undoubtedly the _dossier___ is\\na great institution. But what is that?” He turned sharply.\\n\\nA figure was running hatless, down the road after us. It was Marthe\\nDaubreuil.\\n\\n“I beg your pardon,” she cried breathlessly, as she reached us. “I—I\\nshould not do this, I know. You must not tell my mother. But is it\\ntrue, what the people say, that M. Renauld called in a detective before\\nhe died, and—and that you are he?”\\n\\n“Yes, mademoiselle,” said Poirot gently. “It is quite true. But how did\\nyou learn it?”\\n\\n“Françoise told our Amélie,” explained Marthe, with a blush.\\n\\nPoirot made a grimace.\\n\\n“The secrecy, it is impossible in an affair of this kind! Not that it\\nmatters. Well, mademoiselle, what is it you want to know?”\\n\\nThe girl hesitated. She seemed longing, yet fearing, to speak. At last,\\nalmost in a whisper, she asked:\\n\\n“Is—any one suspected?”\\n\\nPoirot eyed her keenly.\\n\\nThen he replied evasively:\\n\\n“Suspicion is in the air at present, mademoiselle.”\\n\\n“Yes, I know—but—any one in particular?”\\n\\n“Why do you want to know?”\\n\\nThe girl seemed frightened by the question. All at once Poirot’s words\\nabout her earlier in the day recurred to me. The “girl with the anxious\\neyes!”\\n\\n“M. Renauld was always very kind to me,” she replied at last. “It is\\nnatural that I should be interested.”\\n\\n“I see,” said Poirot. “Well, mademoiselle, suspicion at present is\\nhovering round two persons.”\\n\\n“Two?”\\n\\nI could have sworn there was a note of surprise and relief in her\\nvoice.\\n\\n“Their names are unknown, but they are presumed to be Chilians from\\nSantiago. And now, mademoiselle, you see what comes of being young and\\nbeautiful! I have betrayed professional secrets for you!”\\n\\nThe girl laughed merrily, and then, rather shyly, she thanked him.\\n\\n“I must run back now. _Maman___ will miss me.”\\n\\nAnd she turned and ran back up the road, looking like a modern\\nAtalanta. I stared after her.\\n\\n“_Mon ami___,” said Poirot, in his gentle ironical voice, “is it that\\nwe are to remain planted here all night—just because you have seen a\\nbeautiful young woman, and your head is in a whirl?”\\n\\nI laughed and apologized.\\n\\n“But she _is___ beautiful, Poirot. Any one might be excused for being\\nbowled over by her.”\\n\\nPoirot groaned.\\n\\n“_Mon Dieu!___ But it is that you have the susceptible heart!”\\n\\n“Poirot,” I said, “do you remember after the Styles Case when—”\\n\\n“When you were in love with two charming women at once, and neither of\\nthem were for you? Yes, I remember.”\\n\\n“You consoled me by saying that perhaps some day we should hunt\\ntogether again, and that then—”\\n\\n“_Eh bien?___”\\n\\n“Well, we are hunting together again, and—” I paused, and laughed\\nrather self-consciously.\\n\\nBut to my surprise Poirot shook his head very earnestly.\\n\\n“Ah, _mon ami___, do not set your heart on Marthe Daubreuil. She is not\\nfor you, that one! Take it from Papa Poirot!”\\n\\n“Why,” I cried, “the commissary assured me that she was as good as she\\nis beautiful! A perfect angel!”\\n\\n“Some of the greatest criminals I have known had the faces of angels,”\\nremarked Poirot cheerfully. “A malformation of the grey cells may\\ncoincide quite easily with the face of a madonna.”\\n\\n“Poirot,” I cried, horrified, “you cannot mean that you suspect an\\ninnocent child like this!”\\n\\n“Ta-ta-ta! Do not excite yourself! I have not said that I suspected\\nher. But you must admit that her anxiety to know about the case is\\nsomewhat unusual.”\\n\\n“For once, I see further than you do,” I said. “Her anxiety is not for\\nherself—but for her mother.”\\n\\n“My friend,” said Poirot, “as usual, you see nothing at all. Madame\\nDaubreuil is very well able to look after herself without her daughter\\nworrying about her. I admit I was teasing you just now, but all the\\nsame I repeat what I said before. Do not set your heart on that girl.\\nShe is not for you! I, Hercule Poirot, know it. _Sacré!___ if only I\\ncould remember where I had seen that face!”\\n\\n“What face?” I asked, surprised. “The daughter’s?”\\n\\n“No. The mother’s.”\\n\\nNoting my surprise, he nodded emphatically.\\n\\n“But yes—it is as I tell you. It was a long time ago, when I was still\\nwith the Police in Belgium. I have never actually seen the woman\\nbefore, but I have seen her picture—and in connection with some case. I\\nrather fancy—”\\n\\n“Yes?”\\n\\n“I may be mistaken, but I rather fancy that it was a murder case!”\\n\\n\\n\\n8 An Unexpected Meeting\\n\\nWe were up at the Villa betimes next morning. The man on guard at the\\ngate did not bar our way this time. Instead, he respectfully saluted\\nus, and we passed on to the house. The maid Léonie was just coming down\\nthe stairs, and seemed not averse to the prospect of a little\\nconversation.\\n\\nPoirot inquired after the health of Mrs. Renauld.\\n\\nLéonie shook her head.\\n\\n“She is terribly upset, _la pauvre dame!___ She will eat nothing—but\\nnothing! And she is as pale as a ghost. It is heartrending to see her.\\nAh, _par exemple___, it is not I who would grieve like that for a man\\nwho had deceived me with another woman!”\\n\\nPoirot nodded sympathetically.\\n\\n“What you say is very just, but what will you? The heart of a woman who\\nloves will forgive many blows. Still, undoubtedly there must have been\\nmany scenes of recrimination between them in the last few months?”\\n\\nAgain Léonie shook her head.\\n\\n“Never, monsieur. Never have I heard Madame utter a word of protest—of\\nreproach, even! She had the temper and disposition of an angel—quite\\ndifferent to Monsieur.”\\n\\n“Monsieur Renauld had not the temper of an angel?”\\n\\n“Far from it. When he enraged himself, the whole house knew of it. The\\nday that he quarrelled with M. Jack—_ma foi!___ they might have been\\nheard in the market place, they shouted so loud!”\\n\\n“Indeed,” said Poirot. “And when did this quarrel take place?”\\n\\n“Oh! it was just before M. Jack went to Paris. Almost he missed his\\ntrain. He came out of the library, and caught up his bag which he had\\nleft in the hall. The automobile, it was being repaired, and he had to\\nrun for the station. I was dusting the salon, and I saw him pass, and\\nhis face was white—white—with two burning spots of red. Ah, but he was\\nangry!”\\n\\nLéonie was enjoying her narrative thoroughly.\\n\\n“And the dispute, what was it about?”\\n\\n“Ah, that I do not know,” confessed Léonie. “It is true that they\\nshouted, but their voices were so loud and high, and they spoke so\\nfast, that only one well acquainted with English could have\\ncomprehended. But Monsieur, he was like a thundercloud all day!\\nImpossible to please him!”\\n\\nThe sound of a door shutting upstairs cut short Léonie’s loquacity.\\n\\n“And Françoise who awaits me!” she exclaimed, awakening to a tardy\\nremembrance of her duties. “That old one, she always scolds.”\\n\\n“One moment, mademoiselle. The examining magistrate, where is he?”\\n\\n“They have gone out to look at the automobile in the garage. Monsieur\\nthe commissary had some idea that it might have been used on the night\\nof the murder.”\\n\\n“_Quelle idée___,” murmured Poirot, as the girl disappeared.\\n\\n“You will go out and join them?”\\n\\n“No, I shall await their return in the _salon___. It is cool there on\\nthis hot morning.”\\n\\nThis placid way of taking things did not quite commend itself to me.\\n\\n“If you don’t mind—” I said, and hesitated.\\n\\n“Not in the least. You wish to investigate on your own account, eh?”\\n\\n“Well, I’d rather like to have a look at Giraud, if he’s anywhere\\nabout, and see what he’s up to.”\\n\\n“The human foxhound,” murmured Poirot, as he leaned back in a\\ncomfortable chair, and closed his eyes. “By all means, my friend. Au\\nrevoir.”\\n\\nI strolled out of the front door. It was certainly hot. I turned up the\\npath we had taken the day before. I had a mind to study the scene of\\nthe crime myself. I did not go directly to the spot, however, but\\nturned aside into the bushes, so as to come out on the links some\\nhundred yards or so further to the right. If Giraud were still on the\\nspot, I wanted to observe his methods before he knew of my presence.\\nBut the shrubbery here was much denser, and I had quite a struggle to\\nforce my way through. When I emerged at last on the course, it was\\nquite unexpectedly and with such vigour that I cannoned heavily into a\\nyoung lady who had been standing with her back to the plantation.\\n\\nShe not unnaturally gave a suppressed shriek, but I, too, uttered an\\nexclamation of surprise. For it was my friend of the train, Cinderella!\\n\\nThe surprise was mutual.\\n\\n“You,” we both exclaimed simultaneously.\\n\\nThe young lady recovered herself first.\\n\\n“My only Aunt!” she exclaimed. “What are you doing here?”\\n\\n“For the matter of that, what are you?” I retorted.\\n\\n“When last I saw you, the day before yesterday, you were trotting home\\nto England like a good little boy. Have they given you a season ticket\\nto and fro, on the strength of your M.P.?”\\n\\nI ignored the end of the speech.\\n\\n“When last I saw you,” I said, “you were trotting home with your\\nsister, like a good little girl. By the way, how is your sister?”\\n\\nA flash of white teeth rewarded me.\\n\\n“How kind of you to ask! My sister is well, I thank you.”\\n\\n“She is here with you?”\\n\\n“She remained in town,” said the minx with dignity.\\n\\n“I don’t believe you’ve got a sister,” I laughed. “If you have, her\\nname is Harris!”\\n\\n“Do you remember mine?” she asked, with a smile.\\n\\n“Cinderella. But you’re going to tell me the real one now, aren’t you?”\\n\\nShe shook her head with a wicked look.\\n\\n“Not even why you’re here?”\\n\\n“Oh, that! I suppose you’ve heard of members of my profession\\n‘resting.’\\u200a”\\n\\n“At expensive French watering-places?”\\n\\n“Dirt cheap if you know where to go.”\\n\\nI eyed her keenly.\\n\\n“Still, you’d no intention of coming here when I met you two days ago?”\\n\\n“We all have our disappointments,” said Miss Cinderella sententiously.\\n“There now, I’ve told you quite as much as is good for you. Little boys\\nshould not be inquisitive. You’ve not yet told me what you’re doing\\nhere? Got the M.P. in tow, I suppose, doing the gay boy on the beach.”\\n\\nI shook my head. “Guess again. You remember my telling you that my\\ngreat friend was a detective?”\\n\\n“Yes?”\\n\\n“And perhaps you’ve heard about this crime—at the Villa Geneviève—?”\\n\\nShe stared at me. Her breast heaved, and her eyes grew wide and round.\\n\\n“You don’t mean—that you’re in on _that?___”\\n\\nI nodded. There was no doubt that I had scored heavily. Her emotion, as\\nshe regarded me, was only too evident. For some few seconds, she\\nremained silent, staring at me. Then she nodded her head emphatically.\\n\\n“Well, if that doesn’t beat the band! Tote me round. I want to see all\\nthe horrors.”\\n\\n“What do you mean?”\\n\\n“What I say. Bless the boy, didn’t I tell you I doted on crimes? What\\ndo you think I’m imperilling my ankles for in high-heeled shoes over\\nthis stubble? I’ve been nosing round for hours. Tried the front way in,\\nbut that old stick-in-the-mud of a French gendarme wasn’t taking any. I\\nguess Helen of Troy, and Cleopatra, and Mary, Queen of Scots, rolled in\\none wouldn’t cut ice with him! It’s a real piece of luck happening on\\nyou this way. Come on, show me all the sights.”\\n\\n“But look here—wait a minute—I can’t. Nobody’s allowed in. They’re\\nawfully strict.”\\n\\n“Aren’t you and your friend the big bugs?”\\n\\nI was loath to relinquish my position of importance.\\n\\n“Why are you so keen?” I asked weakly. “And what is it you want to\\nsee.”\\n\\n“Oh, everything! The place where it happened, and the weapon, and the\\nbody, and any finger-prints or interesting things like that. I’ve never\\nhad a chance of being right in on a murder like this before. It’ll last\\nme all my life?”\\n\\nI turned away, sickened. What were women coming to nowadays? The girl’s\\nghoulish excitement nauseated me. I had read of the mobs of women who\\nbesieged the law courts when some wretched man was being tried for his\\nlife on the capital charge. I had sometimes wondered who these women\\nwere. Now I knew. They were of the likeness of Cinderella, young, yet\\nobsessed with a yearning for morbid excitement, for sensation at any\\nprice, without regard to any decency or good feeling. The vividness of\\nthe girl’s beauty had attracted me in spite of myself, yet at heart I\\nretained my first impression of disapproval and dislike. I thought of\\nmy mother, long since dead. What would she have said of this strange\\nmodern product of girlhood? The pretty face with the paint and powder,\\nand the ghoulish mind behind!\\n\\n“Come off your high horse,” said the lady suddenly. “And don’t give\\nyourself airs. When you got called to this job, did you put your nose\\nin the air and say it was a nasty business, and you wouldn’t be mixed\\nup in it?”\\n\\n“No, but—”\\n\\n“If you’d been here on a holiday, wouldn’t you be nosing round just the\\nsame as I am? Of course you would.”\\n\\n“I’m a man. You’re a woman.”\\n\\n“Your idea of a woman is some one who gets on a chair and shrieks if\\nshe sees a mouse. That’s all prehistoric. But you _will___ show me\\nround, won’t you? You see, it might make a big difference to me.”\\n\\n“In what way?”\\n\\n“They’re keeping all the reporters out. I might make a big scoop with\\none of the papers. You don’t know how much they pay for a bit of inside\\nstuff.”\\n\\nI hesitated. She slipped a small soft hand into mine.\\n\\n“_Please___—there’s a dear.”\\n\\nI capitulated. Secretly, I knew that I should rather enjoy the part of\\nshowman. After all, the moral attitude displayed by the girl was none\\nof my business. I was a little nervous as to what the examining\\nmagistrate might say, but I reassured myself by the reflection that no\\nharm could possibly be done.\\n\\nWe repaired first to the spot where the body had been discovered. A man\\nwas on guard there, who saluted respectfully, knowing me by sight, and\\nraised no question as to my companion. Presumably he regarded her as\\nvouched for by me. I explained to Cinderella just how the discovery had\\nbeen made, and she listened attentively, sometimes putting an\\nintelligent question. Then we turned our steps in the direction of the\\nVilla. I proceeded rather cautiously, for, truth to tell, I was not at\\nall anxious to meet any one. I took the girl through the shrubbery\\nround to the back of the house where the small shed was. I recollected\\nthat yesterday evening, after relocking the door, M. Bex had left the\\nkey with the _sergent de ville___ Marchaud, “in case M. Giraud should\\nrequire it while we are upstairs.” I thought it quite likely that the\\nSûreté detective, after using it, had returned it to Marchaud again.\\nLeaving the girl out of sight in the shrubbery, I entered the house.\\nMarchaud was on duty outside the door of the _salon___. From within\\ncame the murmur of voices.\\n\\n“Monsieur desires Hautet? He is within. He is again interrogating\\nFrançoise.”\\n\\n“No,” I said hastily, “I don’t want him. But I should very much like\\nthe key of the shed outside if it is not against regulations.”\\n\\n“But certainly, monsieur.” He produced it. “Here it is. M. le juge gave\\norders that all facilities were to be placed at your disposal. You will\\nreturn it to me when you have finished out there, that is all.”\\n\\n“Of course.”\\n\\nI felt a thrill of satisfaction as I realized that in Marchaud’s eyes,\\nat least, I ranked equally in importance with Poirot. The girl was\\nwaiting for me. She gave an exclamation of delight as she saw the key\\nin my hand.\\n\\n“You’ve got it then?”\\n\\n“Of course,” I said coolly. “All the same, you know, what I’m doing is\\nhighly irregular.”\\n\\n“You’ve been a perfect duck, and I shan’t forget it. Come along. They\\ncan’t see us from the house, can they?”\\n\\n“Wait a minute.” I arrested her eager advance. “I won’t stop you if you\\nreally wish to go in. But do you? You’ve seen the grave, and the\\ngrounds, and you’ve heard all the details of the affair. Isn’t that\\nenough for you? This is going to be gruesome, you know,\\nand—unpleasant.”\\n\\nShe looked at me for a moment with an expression that I could not quite\\nfathom. Then she laughed.\\n\\n“Me for the horrors,” she said. “Come along.”\\n\\nIn silence we arrived at the door of the shed. I opened it and we\\npassed in. I walked over to the body, and gently pulled down the sheet\\nas M. Bex had done the preceding afternoon. A little gasping sound\\nescaped from the girl’s lips, and I turned and looked at her. There was\\nhorror on her face now, and those debonair high spirits of hers were\\nquenched utterly. She had not chosen to listen to my advice, and she\\nwas punished now for her disregard of it. I felt singularly merciless\\ntowards her. She should go through with it now. I turned the corpse\\ngently over.\\n\\n“You see,” I said, “he was stabbed in the back.”\\n\\nHer voice was almost soundless.\\n\\n“With what?”\\n\\nI nodded towards the glass jar.\\n\\n“That dagger.”\\n\\nSuddenly the girl reeled, and then sank down in a heap. I sprang to her\\nassistance.\\n\\n“You are faint. Come out of here. It has been too much for you.”\\n\\n“Water,” she murmured. “Quick. Water.\\u200a…”\\n\\nI left her, and rushed into the house. Fortunately none of the servants\\nwere about, and I was able to secure a glass of water unobserved and\\nadd a few drops of brandy from a pocket flask. In a few minutes I was\\nback again. The girl was lying as I had left her, but a few sips of the\\nbrandy and water revived her in a marvellous manner.\\n\\n“Take me out of here—oh, quickly, quickly!” she cried, shuddering.\\n\\nSupporting her with my arm I led her out into the air, and she pulled\\nthe door to behind her. Then she drew a deep breath.\\n\\n“That’s better. Oh, it was horrible! Why did you ever let me go in?”\\n\\nI felt this to be so feminine that I could not forbear a smile.\\nSecretly, I was not dissatisfied with her collapse. It proved that she\\nwas not quite so callous as I had thought her. After all she was little\\nmore than a child, and her curiosity had probably been of the\\nunthinking order.\\n\\n“I did my best to stop you, you know,” I said gently.\\n\\n“I suppose you did. Well, good-bye.”\\n\\n“Look here, you can’t start off like that—all alone. You’re not fit for\\nit. I insist on accompanying you back to Merlinville.”\\n\\n“Nonsense. I’m quite all right now.”\\n\\n“Supposing you felt faint again? No, I shall come with you.”\\n\\nBut this she combated with a good deal of energy. In the end, however,\\nI prevailed so far as to be allowed to accompany her to the outskirts\\nof the town. We retraced our steps over our former route, passing the\\ngrave again, and making a detour on to the road. Where the first\\nstraggling line of shops began, she stopped and held out her hand.\\n\\n“Good-bye, and thank you ever so much for coming with me.”\\n\\n“Are you sure you’re all right now?”\\n\\n“Quite, thanks. I hope you won’t get into any trouble over showing me\\nthings?”\\n\\nI disclaimed the idea lightly.\\n\\n“Well, good-bye.”\\n\\n“Au revoir,” I corrected. “If you’re staying here, we shall meet\\nagain.”\\n\\nShe flashed a smile at me.\\n\\n“That’s so. Au revoir, then.”\\n\\n“Wait a second, you haven’t told me your address?”\\n\\n“Oh, I’m staying at the Hôtel du Phare. It’s a little place, but quite\\ngood. Come and look me up tomorrow.”\\n\\n“I will,” I said, with perhaps rather unnecessary _empressement___.\\n\\nI watched her out of sight, then turned and retraced my steps to the\\nVilla. I remembered that I had not relocked the door of the shed.\\nFortunately no one had noticed the oversight, and turning the key I\\nremoved it and returned it to the _sergent de ville___. And, as I did\\nso, it came upon me suddenly that though Cinderella had given me her\\naddress I still did not know her name.\\n\\n\\n\\n9 M. Giraud Finds Some Clues\\n\\nIn the _Salon___ I found the examining magistrate busily interrogating\\nthe old gardener Auguste. Poirot and the commissary, who were both\\npresent, greeted me respectively with a smile and a polite bow. I\\nslipped quietly into a seat. M. Hautet was painstaking and meticulous\\nin the extreme, but did not succeed in eliciting anything of\\nimportance.\\n\\nThe gardening gloves Auguste admitted to be his. He wore them when\\nhandling a certain species of primula plant which was poisonous to some\\npeople. He could not say when he had worn them last. Certainly he had\\nnot missed them. Where were they kept? Sometimes in one place,\\nsometimes in another. The spade was usually to be found in the small\\ntool shed. Was it locked? Of course it was locked. Where was the key\\nkept? _Parbleu___, it was in the door of course! There was nothing of\\nvalue to steal. Who would have expected a party of bandits, of\\nassassins? Such things did not happen in Madame la Vicomtesse’s time.\\nM. Hautet signifying that he had finished with him, the old man\\nwithdrew, grumbling to the last. Remembering Poirot’s unaccountable\\ninsistence on the footprints in the flower beds, I scrutinized him\\nnarrowly as he gave his evidence. Either he had nothing to do with the\\ncrime or he was a consummate actor. Suddenly, just as he was going out\\nof the door, an idea struck me. “_Pardon___ M. Hautet,” I cried, “but\\nwill you permit me to ask him one question?”\\n\\n“But certainly, monsieur.”\\n\\nThus encouraged, I turned to Auguste.\\n\\n“Where do you keep your boots?”\\n\\n“_Sac à papier!___” growled the old man. “On my feet. Where else?”\\n\\n“But when you go to bed at night?”\\n\\n“Under my bed.”\\n\\n“But who cleans them?”\\n\\n“Nobody. Why should they be cleaned? Is it that I promenade myself on\\nthe front like a young man? On Sunday I wear the Sunday boots, _bien\\nentendu___, but otherwise—!” he shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\nI shook my head, discouraged.\\n\\n“Well, well,” said the magistrate. “We do not advance very much.\\nUndoubtedly we are held up until we get the return cable from Santiago.\\nHas any one seen Giraud? In verity that one lacks politeness! I have a\\nvery good mind to send for him and—”\\n\\n“You will not have to send far, M. le juge.”\\n\\nThe quiet voice startled us. Giraud was standing outside looking in\\nthrough the open window.\\n\\nHe leaped lightly into the room, and advanced to the table.\\n\\n“Here I am, M. le juge, at your service. Accept my excuses for not\\npresenting myself sooner.”\\n\\n“Not at all. Not at all,” said the magistrate, rather confused.\\n\\n“Of course I am only a detective,” continued the other. “I know nothing\\nof interrogatories. Were I conducting one, I should be inclined to do\\nso without an open window. Any one standing outside can so easily hear\\nall that passes.\\u200a… But no matter.”\\n\\nM. Hautet flushed angrily. There was evidently going to be no love lost\\nbetween the examining magistrate and the detective in charge of the\\ncase. They had fallen foul of each other at the start. Perhaps in any\\nevent it would have been much the same. To Giraud, all examining\\nmagistrates were fools, and to M. Hautet who took himself seriously,\\nthe casual manner of the Paris detective could not fail to give\\noffence.\\n\\n“_Eh bien___, M. Giraud,” said the magistrate rather sharply. “Without\\ndoubt you have been employing your time to a marvel? You have the names\\nof the assassins for us, have you not? And also the precise spot where\\nthey find themselves now?”\\n\\nUnmoved by this irony, Giraud replied:\\n\\n“I know at least where they have come from.”\\n\\n“_Comment?___”\\n\\nGiraud took two small objects from his pocket and laid them down on the\\ntable. We crowded round. The objects were very simple ones: the stub of\\na cigarette, and an unlighted match. The detective wheeled round on\\nPoirot.\\n\\n“What do you see there?” he asked.\\n\\nThere was something almost brutal in his tone. It made my cheeks flush.\\nBut Poirot remained unmoved. He shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n“A cigarette end, and a match.”\\n\\n“And what does that tell you?”\\n\\nPoirot spread out his hands.\\n\\n“It tells me—nothing.”\\n\\n“Ah!” said Giraud, in a satisfied voice. “You haven’t made a study of\\nthese things. That’s not an ordinary match—not in this country at\\nleast. It’s common enough in South America. Luckily it’s unlighted. I\\nmightn’t have recognized it otherwise. Evidently one of the men threw\\naway his cigarette end, and lit another, spilling one match out of the\\nbox as he did so.”\\n\\n“And the other match?” asked Poirot.\\n\\n“Which match?”\\n\\n“The one he _did___ light his cigarette with. You have found that\\nalso?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“Perhaps you didn’t search very thoroughly.”\\n\\n“Not search thoroughly—” For a moment it seemed as though the detective\\nwere going to break out angrily, but with an effort he controlled\\nhimself. “I see you love a joke, M. Poirot. But in any case, match or\\nno match, the cigarette end would be sufficient. It is a South American\\ncigarette with liquorice pectoral paper.”\\n\\nPoirot bowed. The commissary spoke:\\n\\n“The cigarette end and match might have belonged to M. Renauld.\\nRemember, it is only two years since he returned from South America.”\\n\\n“No,” replied the other confidently. “I have already searched among the\\neffects of M. Renauld. The cigarettes he smoked and the matches he used\\nare quite different.”\\n\\n“You do not think it odd,” asked Poirot, “that these strangers should\\ncome unprovided with a weapon, with gloves, with a spade, and that they\\nshould so conveniently find all these things?”\\n\\nGiraud smiled in a rather superior manner.\\n\\n“Undoubtedly it is strange. Indeed, without the theory that I hold, it\\nwould be inexplicable.”\\n\\n“Aha!” said M. Hautet. “An accomplice. An accomplice within the house!”\\n\\n“Or outside it,” said Giraud with a peculiar smile.\\n\\n“But some one must have admitted them? We cannot allow that, by an\\nunparalleled piece of good fortune, they found the door ajar for them\\nto walk in?”\\n\\n“_D’accord___, M. le juge. The door was opened for them, but it could\\njust as easily be opened from outside—by some one who possessed a key.”\\n\\n“But who did possess a key?”\\n\\nGiraud shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n“As for that, no one who possesses one is going to admit the fact if\\nthey can help it. But several people _might___ have had one. M. Jack\\nRenauld, the son, for instance. It is true that he is on his way to\\nSouth America, but he might have lost the key or had it stolen from\\nhim. Then there is the gardener—he has been here many years. One of the\\nyounger servants may have a lover. It is easy to take an impression of\\na key and have one cut. There are many possibilities. Then there is\\nanother person who, I should judge, is exceedingly likely to have such\\na thing in her keeping.”\\n\\n“Who is that?”\\n\\n“Madame Daubreuil,” said the detective dryly.\\n\\n“Eh, eh!” said the magistrate, his face falling a little, “so you have\\nheard about that, have you?”\\n\\n“I hear everything,” said Giraud imperturbably.\\n\\n“There is one thing I could swear you have not heard,” said M. Hautet,\\ndelighted to be able to show superior knowledge, and without more ado,\\nhe retailed the story of the mysterious visitor the night before. He\\nalso touched on the cheque made out to “Duveen,” and finally handed\\nGiraud the letter signed “Bella.”\\n\\nGiraud listened in silence, studied the letter attentively, and then\\nhanded it back.\\n\\n“All very interesting, M. le juge. But my theory remains unaffected.”\\n\\n“And your theory is?”\\n\\n“For the moment I prefer not to say. Remember, I am only just beginning\\nmy investigations.”\\n\\n“Tell me one thing, M. Giraud,” said Poirot suddenly. “Your theory\\nallows for the door being opened. It does not explain why it was\\n_left___ open. When they departed, would it not have been natural for\\nthem to close it behind them. If a _sergent de ville___ had chanced to\\ncome up to the house, as is sometimes done to see that all is well,\\nthey might have been discovered and overtaken almost at once.”\\n\\n“Bah! They forgot it. A mistake, I grant you.”\\n\\nThen, to my surprise, Poirot uttered almost the same words as he had\\nuttered to Bex the previous evening:\\n\\n“_I do not agree with you.___ The door being left open was the result\\nof either design or necessity, and any theory that does not admit that\\nfact is bound to prove vain.”\\n\\nWe all regarded the little man with a good deal of astonishment. The\\nconfession of ignorance drawn from him over the match end had, I\\nthought, been bound to humiliate him, but here he was self satisfied as\\never, laying down the law to the great Giraud without a tremor.\\n\\nThe detective twisted his moustache, eyeing my friend in a somewhat\\nbantering fashion.\\n\\n“You don’t agree with me, eh? Well, what strikes you particularly about\\nthe case. Let’s hear your views.”\\n\\n“One thing presents itself to me as being significant. Tell me, M.\\nGiraud, does nothing strike you as familiar about this case? Is there\\nnothing it reminds you of?”\\n\\n“Familiar? Reminds me of? I can’t say off-hand. I don’t think so,\\nthough.”\\n\\n“You are wrong,” said Poirot quietly. “A crime almost precisely similar\\nhas been committed before.”\\n\\n“When? And where?”\\n\\n“Ah, that, unfortunately, I cannot for the moment remember—but I shall\\ndo so. I had hoped you might be able to assist me.”\\n\\nGiraud snorted incredulously.\\n\\n“There have been many affairs of masked men! I cannot remember the\\ndetails of them all. These crimes all resemble each other more or\\nless.”\\n\\n“There is such a thing as the individual touch.” Poirot suddenly\\nassumed his lecturing manner, and addressed us collectively. “I am\\nspeaking to you now of the psychology of crime. M. Giraud knows quite\\nwell that each criminal has his particular method, and that the police,\\nwhen called in to investigate—say a case of burglary—can often make a\\nshrewd guess at the offender, simply by the peculiar method he has\\nemployed. (Japp would tell you the same, Hastings.) Man is an\\nunoriginal animal. Unoriginal within the law in his daily respectable\\nlife, equally unoriginal outside the law. If a man commits a crime, any\\nother crime he commits will resemble it closely. The English murderer\\nwho disposed of his wives in succession by drowning them in their baths\\nwas a case in point. Had he varied his methods, he might have escaped\\ndetection to this day. But he obeyed the common dictates of human\\nnature, arguing that what had once succeeded would succeed again, and\\nhe paid the penalty of his lack of originality.”\\n\\n“And the point of all this?” sneered Giraud.\\n\\n“That when you have two crimes precisely similar in design and\\nexecution, you find the same brain behind them both. I am looking for\\nthat brain, M. Giraud—and I shall find it. Here we have a true clue—a\\npsychological clue. You may know all about cigarettes and match ends,\\nM. Giraud, but I, Hercule Poirot, know the mind of man!” And the\\nridiculous little fellow tapped his forehead with emphasis.\\n\\nGiraud remained singularly unimpressed.\\n\\n“For your guidance,” continued Poirot, “I will also advise you of one\\nfact which might fail to be brought to your notice. The wrist watch of\\nMadame Renauld, on the day following the tragedy, had gained two hours.\\nIt might interest you to examine it.”\\n\\nGiraud stared.\\n\\n“Perhaps it was in the habit of gaining?”\\n\\n“As a matter of fact, I am told it did.”\\n\\n“_Eh bien___, then!”\\n\\n“All the same, two hours is a good deal,” said Poirot softly. “Then\\nthere is the matter of the footprints in the flower-bed.”\\n\\nHe nodded his head towards the open window. Giraud took two eager\\nstrides, and looked out.\\n\\n“This bed here?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“But I see no footprints?”\\n\\n“No,” said Poirot, straightening a little pile of books on a table.\\n“There are none.”\\n\\nFor a moment an almost murderous rage obscured Giraud’s face. He took\\ntwo strides towards his tormentor, but at that moment the _salon___\\ndoor was opened, and Marchaud announced.\\n\\n“M. Stonor, the secretary, has just arrived from England. May he\\nenter?”\\n\\n\\n\\n10 Gabriel Stonor\\n\\nThe man who entered the room was a striking figure. Very tall, with a\\nwell knit athletic frame, and a deeply bronzed face and neck, he\\ndominated the assembly. Even Giraud seemed anaemic beside him. When I\\nknew him better I realized that Gabriel Stonor was quite an unusual\\npersonality. English by birth, he had knocked about all over the world.\\nHe had shot big game in Africa, travelled in Korea, ranched in\\nCalifornia, and traded in the South Sea Islands. He had been secretary\\nto a New York railway magnate, and had spent a year encamped in the\\ndesert with a friendly tribe of Arabs.\\n\\nHis unerring eye picked out M. Hautet.\\n\\n“The examining magistrate in charge of the case? Pleased to meet you,\\nM. le juge. This is a terrible business. How’s Mrs. Renauld? Is she\\nbearing up fairly well? It must have been an awful shock to her.”\\n\\n“Terrible, terrible,” said M. Hautet. “Permit me to introduce M.\\nBex—our commissary of police, M. Giraud of the Sûreté. This gentleman\\nis M. Hercule Poirot. M. Renauld sent for him, but he arrived too late\\nto do anything to avert the tragedy. A friend of M. Poirot’s, Captain\\nHastings.”\\n\\nStonor looked at Poirot with some interest.\\n\\n“Sent for you, did he?”\\n\\n“You did not know, then, that M. Renauld contemplated calling in a\\ndetective?” interposed M. Bex.\\n\\n“No, I didn’t. But it doesn’t surprise me a bit.”\\n\\n“Why?”\\n\\n“Because the old man was rattled! I don’t know what it was all about.\\nHe didn’t confide in me. We weren’t on those terms. But rattled he\\nwas—and badly!”\\n\\n“H’m!” said M. Hautet. “But you have no notion of the cause?”\\n\\n“That’s what I said, sir.”\\n\\n“You will pardon me, M. Stonor, but we must begin with a few\\nformalities. Your name?”\\n\\n“Gabriel Stonor.”\\n\\n“How long ago was it that you became secretary to M. Renauld?”\\n\\n“About two years ago, when he first arrived from South America. I met\\nhim through a mutual friend, and he offered me the post. A thundering\\ngood boss he was too.”\\n\\n“Did he talk to you much about his life in South America?”\\n\\n“Yes, a good bit.”\\n\\n“Do you know if he was ever in Santiago?”\\n\\n“Several times, I believe.”\\n\\n“He never mentioned any special incident that occurred there—anything\\nthat might have provoked some vendetta against him?”\\n\\n“Never.”\\n\\n“Did he speak of any secret that he had acquired whilst sojourning\\nthere?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“Did he ever say anything at all about a secret?”\\n\\n“Not that I can remember. But, for all that, there _was___ a mystery\\nabout him. I’ve never heard him speak of his boyhood for instance, or\\nof any incident prior to his arrival in South America. He was a French\\nCanadian by birth, I believe, but I’ve never heard him speak of his\\nlife in Canada. He could shut up like a clam if he liked.”\\n\\n“So, as far as you know, he had no enemies, and you can give us no clue\\nas to any secret to obtain possession of which he might have been\\nmurdered?”\\n\\n“That’s so.”\\n\\n“M. Stonor, have you ever heard the name of Duveen in connection with\\nM. Renauld?”\\n\\n“Duveen. Duveen.” He tried the name over thoughtfully. “I don’t think I\\nhave. And yet it seems familiar.”\\n\\n“Do you know a lady, a friend of M. Renauld’s whose Christian name is\\nBella?”\\n\\nAgain Mr. Stonor shook his head.\\n\\n“Bella Duveen? Is that the full name? It’s curious! I’m sure I know it.\\nBut for the moment I can’t remember in what connection.”\\n\\nThe magistrate coughed.\\n\\n“You understand, M. Stonor—the case is like this. _There must be no\\nreservations.___ You might, perhaps, through a feeling of consideration\\nfor Madame Renauld—for whom, I gather, you have a great esteem and\\naffection, you might—_enfin!___” said M. Hautet getting rather tied up\\nin his sentence, “there must absolutely be no reservations.”\\n\\nStonor stared at him, a dawning light of comprehension in his eyes.\\n\\n“I don’t quite get you,” he said gently. “Where does Mrs. Renauld come\\nin? I’ve an immense respect and affection for that lady; she’s a very\\nwonderful and unusual type, but I don’t quite see how my reservations,\\nor otherwise, could affect her?”\\n\\n“Not if this Bella Duveen should prove to have been something more than\\na friend to her husband?”\\n\\n“Ah!” said Stonor. “I get you now. But I’ll bet my bottom dollar that\\nyou’re wrong. The old man never so much as looked at a petticoat. He\\njust adored his own wife. They were the most devoted couple I know.”\\n\\nM. Hautet shook his head gently.\\n\\n“M. Stonor, we hold absolute proof—a love letter written by this Bella\\nto M. Renauld, accusing him of having tired of her. Moreover, we have\\nfurther proof that, at the time of his death, he was carrying on an\\nintrigue with a Frenchwoman, a Madame Daubreuil, who rents the\\nadjoining Villa. And this is the man who, according to you, never\\nlooked at a petticoat!”\\n\\nThe secretary’s eyes narrowed.\\n\\n“Hold on, M. le juge. You’re barking up the wrong tree. I knew Paul\\nRenauld. What you’ve just been saying is utterly impossible. There’s\\nsome other explanation.”\\n\\nThe magistrate shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n“What other explanation could there be?”\\n\\n“What leads you to think it was a love affair?”\\n\\n“Madame Daubreuil was in the habit of visiting him here in the\\nevenings. Also, since M. Renauld came to the Villa Geneviève, Madame\\nDaubreuil has paid large sums of money into the bank in notes. In all,\\nthe amount totals four thousand pounds of your English money.”\\n\\n“I guess that’s right,” said Stonor quietly. “I transmitted him those\\nsums at his request. But it wasn’t an intrigue.”\\n\\n“Eh! _mon Dieu!___ What else could it be?”\\n\\n“_Blackmail___,” said Stonor sharply, bringing down his hand with a\\nslam on the table. “That’s what it was.”\\n\\n“Ah! Voilà une idée!” cried the magistrate, shaken in spite of himself.\\n\\n“Blackmail,” repeated Stonor. “The old man was being bled—and at a good\\nrate too. Four thousand in a couple of months. Whew! I told you just\\nnow there was a mystery about Renauld. Evidently this Madame Daubreuil\\nknew enough of it to put the screws on.”\\n\\n“It is possible,” the commissary cried excitedly. “Decidedly, it is\\npossible.”\\n\\n“Possible?” roared Stonor. “It’s certain! Tell me, have you asked Mrs.\\nRenauld about this love affair stunt of yours?”\\n\\n“No, monsieur. We did not wish to occasion her any distress if it could\\nreasonably be avoided.”\\n\\n“Distress? Why, she’d laugh in your face. I tell you, she and Renauld\\nwere a couple in a hundred.”\\n\\n“Ah, that reminds me of another point,” said M. Hautet. “Did M. Renauld\\ntake you into his confidence at all as to the dispositions of his\\nwill?”\\n\\n“I know all about it—took it to the lawyer for him after he’d drawn it\\nout. I can give you the name of his solicitors if you want to see it.\\nThey’ve got it there. Quite simple. Half in trust to his wife for her\\nlifetime, the other half to his son. A few legacies. I rather think he\\nleft me a thousand.”\\n\\n“When was this will drawn up?”\\n\\n“Oh, about a year and a half ago.”\\n\\n“Would it surprise you very much, M. Stonor, to hear that M. Renauld\\nhad made another will, less than a fortnight ago?”\\n\\nStonor was obviously very much surprised.\\n\\n“I’d no idea of it. What’s it like?”\\n\\n“The whole of his vast fortune is left unreservedly to his wife. There\\nis no mention of his son.”\\n\\nMr. Stonor gave vent to a prolonged whistle.\\n\\n“I call that rather rough on the lad. His mother adores him, of course,\\nbut to the world at large it looks rather like a want of confidence on\\nhis father’s part. It will be rather galling to his pride. Still, it\\nall goes to prove what I told you, that Renauld and his wife were on\\nfirst rate terms.”\\n\\n“Quite so, quite so,” said M. Hautet. “It is possible we shall have to\\nrevise our ideas on several points. We have, of course, cabled to\\nSantiago, and are expecting a reply from there any minute. In all\\npossibility, everything will then be perfectly clear and\\nstraightforward. On the other hand, if your suggestion of blackmail is\\ntrue, Madame Daubreuil ought to be able to give us valuable\\ninformation.”\\n\\nPoirot interjected a remark:\\n\\n“M. Stonor, the English chauffeur, Masters, had he been long with M.\\nRenauld?”\\n\\n“Over a year?”\\n\\n“Have you any idea whether he has ever been in South America?”\\n\\n“I’m quite sure he hasn’t. Before coming to Mr. Renauld, he had been\\nfor many years with some people in Gloucestershire whom I know well.”\\n\\n“In fact, you can answer for him as being above suspicion?”\\n\\n“Absolutely.”\\n\\nPoirot seemed somewhat crest-fallen.\\n\\nMeanwhile the magistrate had summoned Marchaud.\\n\\n“My compliments to Madame Renauld, and I should be glad to speak to her\\nfor a few minutes. Beg her not to disturb herself. I will wait upon her\\nupstairs.”\\n\\nMarchaud saluted and disappeared.\\n\\nWe waited some minutes, and then, to our surprise, the door opened, and\\nMrs. Renauld, deathly pale in her heavy mourning, entered the room.\\n\\nM. Hautet brought forward a chair, uttering vigorous protestations, and\\nshe thanked him with a smile. Stonor was holding one hand of hers in\\nhis with an eloquent sympathy. Words evidently failed him. Mrs. Renauld\\nturned to M. Hautet.\\n\\n“You wished to ask me something, M. le juge.”\\n\\n“With your permission, madame. I understand your husband was a French\\nCanadian by birth. Can you tell me anything of his youth, or\\nupbringing?”\\n\\nShe shook her head.\\n\\n“My husband was always very reticent about himself, monsieur. He came\\nfrom the North West, I know, but I fancy that he had an unhappy\\nchildhood, for he never cared to speak of that time. Our life was lived\\nentirely in the present and the future.”\\n\\n“Was there any mystery in his past life?”\\n\\nMrs. Renauld smiled a little, and shook her head.\\n\\n“Nothing so romantic, I am sure, M. le juge.”\\n\\nM. Hautet also smiled.\\n\\n“True, we must not permit ourselves to get melodramatic. There is one\\nthing more—” he hesitated.\\n\\nStonor broke in impetuously:\\n\\n“They’ve got an extraordinary idea into their heads Mrs. Renauld. They\\nactually fancy that Mr. Renauld was carrying on an intrigue with a\\nMadame Daubreuil who, it seems, lives next door.”\\n\\nThe scarlet colour flamed into Mrs. Renauld’s cheeks. She flung her\\nhead up, then bit her lip, her face quivering. Stonor stood looking at\\nher in astonishment, but M. Bex leaned forward and said gently: “We\\nregret to cause you pain, madame, but have you any reason to believe\\nthat Madame Daubreuil was your husband’s mistress?”\\n\\nWith a sob of anguish, Mrs. Renauld buried her face in her hands. Her\\nshoulders heaved convulsively. At last she lifted her head, and said\\nbrokenly:\\n\\n“She may have been.”\\n\\nNever, in all my life, have I seen anything to equal the blank\\namazement on Stonor’s face. He was thoroughly taken aback.\\n\\n\\n\\n11 Jack Renauld\\n\\nWhat the next development of the conversation would have been, I cannot\\nsay, for at that moment the door was thrown violently open, and a tall\\nyoung man strode into the room.\\n\\nJust for a moment I had the uncanny sensation that the dead man had\\ncome to life again. Then I realized that this dark head was untouched\\nwith grey, and that, in point of fact, it was a mere boy who now burst\\nin among us with so little ceremony. He went straight to Mrs. Renauld\\nwith an impetuosity that took no heed of the presence of others.\\n\\n“Mother!”\\n\\n“Jack!” With a cry she folded him in her arms. “My dearest! But what\\nbrings you here? You were to sail on the _Anzora___ from Cherbourg two\\ndays ago?” Then, suddenly recalling to herself the presence of others,\\nshe turned with a certain dignity, “My son, messieurs.”\\n\\n“Aha!” said M. Hautet, acknowledging the young man’s bow. “So you did\\nnot sail on the _Anzora?___”\\n\\n“No, monsieur. As I was about to explain, the _Anzora___ was detained\\ntwenty-four hours through engine trouble. I should have sailed last\\nnight instead of the night before, but, happening to buy an evening\\npaper, I saw in it an account of the—the awful tragedy that had\\nbefallen us—” His voice broke and the tears came into his eyes. “My\\npoor father—my poor, poor, father.”\\n\\nStaring at him like one in a dream, Mrs. Renauld repeated: “So you did\\nnot sail?” And then, with a gesture of infinite weariness, she murmured\\nas though to herself, “After all, it does not matter—now.”\\n\\n“Sit down, M. Renauld, I beg of you,” said M. Hautet, indicating a\\nchair. “My sympathy for you is profound. It must have been a terrible\\nshock to you to learn the news as you did. However, it is most\\nfortunate that you were prevented from sailing. I am in hopes that you\\nmay be able to give us just the information we need to clear up this\\nmystery.”\\n\\n“I am at your disposal, M. le juge. Ask me any questions you please.”\\n\\n“To begin with, I understand that this journey was being undertaken at\\nyour father’s request?”\\n\\n“Quite so, M. le juge. I received a telegram bidding me to proceed\\nwithout delay to Buenos Ayres, and from thence via the Andes to\\nValparaiso and on to Santiago.”\\n\\n“Ah. And the object of this journey?”\\n\\n“I have no idea, M. le juge.”\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“No. See, here is the telegram.”\\n\\nThe magistrate took it and read it aloud.\\n\\n“\\u200a‘Proceed immediately Cherbourg embark _Anzora___ sailing tonight\\nBuenos Ayres. Ultimate destination Santiago. Further instructions will\\nawait you Buenos Ayres. Do not fail. Matter is of utmost importance.\\nRenauld.’ And there had been no previous correspondence on the matter?”\\n\\nJack Renauld shook his head.\\n\\n“That is the only intimation of any kind. I knew, of course, that my\\nfather, having lived so long out there, had necessarily many interests\\nin South America. But he had never mooted any suggestion of sending me\\nout.”\\n\\n“You have, of course, been a good deal in South America, M. Renauld?”\\n\\n“I was there as a child. But I was educated in England, and spent most\\nof my holidays in that country, so I really know far less of South\\nAmerica than might be supposed. You see, the war broke out when I was\\nseventeen.”\\n\\n“You served in the English Flying Corps, did you not?”\\n\\n“Yes, M. le juge.”\\n\\nM. Hautet nodded his head, and proceeded with his inquiries along the,\\nby now, well-known lines. In response, Jack Renauld declared definitely\\nthat he knew nothing of any enmity his father might have incurred in\\nthe city of Santiago, or elsewhere in the South American continent,\\nthat he had noticed no change in his father’s manner of late, and that\\nhe had never heard him refer to a secret. He had regarded the mission\\nto South America as connected with business interests.\\n\\nAs M. Hautet paused for a minute, the quiet voice of Giraud broke in.\\n\\n“I should like to put a few questions on my own account, M. le juge.”\\n\\n“By all means, M. Giraud, if you wish,” said the magistrate coldly.\\n\\nGiraud edged his chair a little nearer to the table.\\n\\n“Were you on good terms with your father, M. Renauld?”\\n\\n“Certainly I was,” returned the lad haughtily.\\n\\n“You assert that positively?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“No little disputes, eh?”\\n\\nJack shrugged his shoulders. “Every one may have a difference of\\nopinion now and then.”\\n\\n“Quite so, quite so. But if any one were to assert that you had a\\nviolent quarrel with your father on the eve of your departure for\\nParis, that person, without doubt, would be lying?”\\n\\nI could not but admire the ingenuity of Giraud. His boast “I know\\neverything” had been no idle one. Jack Renauld was clearly disconcerted\\nby the question.\\n\\n“We—we did have an argument,” he admitted.\\n\\n“Ah, an argument! In the course of that argument did you use this\\nphrase: ‘When you are dead, I can do as I please?’\\u200a”\\n\\n“I may have done,” muttered the other. “I don’t know.”\\n\\n“In response to that, did your father say: ‘But I am not dead yet!’ To\\nwhich you responded: ‘I wish you were!’\\u200a”\\n\\nThe boy made no answer. His hands fiddled nervously with the things on\\nthe table in front of him.\\n\\n“I must request an answer, please, M. Renauld,” said Giraud sharply.\\n\\nWith an angry exclamation, the boy swept a heavy paper-knife on to the\\nfloor.\\n\\n“What does it matter? You might as well know. Yes, I did quarrel with\\nmy father. I dare say I said all those things—I was so angry I cannot\\neven remember what I said! I was furious—I could almost have killed him\\nat that moment—there, make the most of that!” He leant back in his\\nchair, flushed and defiant.\\n\\nGiraud smiled, then, moving his chair back a little, said:\\n\\n“That is all. You would, without doubt, prefer to continue the\\ninterrogatory, M. le juge.”\\n\\n“Ah, yes, exactly,” said M. Hautet. “And what was the subject of your\\nquarrel?”\\n\\n“I decline to state.”\\n\\nM. Hautet sat up in his chair.\\n\\n“M. Renauld, it is not permitted to trifle with the law!” he thundered.\\n“What was the subject of the quarrel?”\\n\\nYoung Renauld remained silent, his boyish face sullen and overcast. But\\nanother voice spoke, imperturbable and calm, the voice of Hercule\\nPoirot.\\n\\n“I will inform you, if you like, M. le juge.”\\n\\n“You know?”\\n\\n“Certainly I know. The subject of the quarrel was Mademoiselle Marthe\\nDaubreuil.”\\n\\nRenauld sprang round, startled. The magistrate leaned forward.\\n\\n“Is this so, monsieur.”\\n\\nJack Renauld bowed his head.\\n\\n“Yes,” he admitted. “I love Mademoiselle Daubreuil, and I wish to marry\\nher. When I informed my father of the fact, he flew at once into a\\nviolent rage. Naturally I could not stand hearing the girl I loved\\ninsulted, and I, too, lost my temper.”\\n\\nM. Hautet looked across at Mrs. Renauld.\\n\\n“You were aware of this—attachment, madame.”\\n\\n“I feared it,” she replied simply.\\n\\n“Mother,” cried the boy. “You too! Marthe is as good as she is\\nbeautiful. What can you have against her?”\\n\\n“I have nothing against Mademoiselle Daubreuil in any way. But I should\\nprefer you to marry an Englishwoman, or if a Frenchwoman not one who\\nhas a mother of doubtful antecedents!”\\n\\nHer rancour against the older woman showed plainly in her voice, and I\\ncould well understand that it must have been a bitter blow to her when\\nher only son showed signs of falling in love with the daughter of her\\nrival.\\n\\nMrs. Renauld continued, addressing the magistrate:\\n\\n“I ought, perhaps, to have spoken to my husband on the subject, but I\\nhoped that it was only a boy and girl flirtation which would blow over\\nall the quicker if no notice was taken of it. I blame myself now for my\\nsilence, but my husband, as I told you, had seemed so anxious and\\ncare-worn, different altogether from his normal self, that I was\\nchiefly concerned not to give him any additional worry.”\\n\\nM. Hautet nodded.\\n\\n“When you informed your father of your intentions towards Mademoiselle\\nDaubreuil,” he resumed, “he was surprised?”\\n\\n“He seemed completely taken aback. Then he ordered me peremptorily to\\ndismiss any such idea from my mind. He would never give his consent to\\nsuch a marriage. Nettled, I demanded what he had against Mademoiselle\\nDaubreuil. To that he could give no satisfactory reply, but spoke in\\nslighting terms of the mystery surrounding the lives of the mother and\\ndaughter. I answered that I was marrying Marthe, and not her\\nantecedents, but he shouted me down with a peremptory refusal to\\ndiscuss the matter in any way. The whole thing must be given up. The\\ninjustice and high-handedness of it all maddened me—especially since he\\nhimself always seemed to go out of his way to be attentive to the\\nDaubreuils and was always suggesting that they should be asked to the\\nhouse. I lost my head, and we quarrelled in earnest. My father reminded\\nme that I was entirely dependent on him, and it must have been in\\nanswer to that that I made the remark about doing as I pleased after\\nhis death—”\\n\\nPoirot interrupted with a quick question.\\n\\n“You were aware, then, of the terms of your father’s will?”\\n\\n“I knew that he had left half his fortune to me, the other half in\\ntrust for my mother to come to me at her death,” replied the lad.\\n\\n“Proceed with your story,” said the magistrate.\\n\\n“After that we shouted at each other in sheer rage, until I suddenly\\nrealized that I was in danger of missing my train to Paris. I had to\\nrun for the station, still in a white heat of fury. However, once well\\naway, I calmed down. I wrote to Marthe, telling her what had happened,\\nand her reply soothed me still further. She pointed out to me that we\\nhad only to be steadfast, and any opposition was bound to give way at\\nlast. Our affection for each other must be tried and proved, and when\\nmy parents realized that it was no light infatuation on my part they\\nwould doubtless relent towards us. Of course, to her, I had not dwelt\\non my father’s principal objection to the match. I soon saw that I\\nshould do my cause no good by violence. My father wrote me several\\nletters to Paris, affectionate in tone, and which did not refer to our\\ndisagreement or its cause, and I replied in the same strain.”\\n\\n“You can produce those letters, eh?” said Giraud.\\n\\n“I did not keep them.”\\n\\n“No matter,” said the detective.\\n\\nRenauld looked at him for a moment, but the magistrate was continuing\\nhis questions.\\n\\n“To pass to another matter, are you acquainted with the name of Duveen,\\nM. Renauld?”\\n\\n“Duveen?” said Jack. “Duveen?” He leant forward, and slowly picked up\\nthe paper-knife he had swept from the table. As he lifted his head, his\\neyes met the watching ones of Giraud. “Duveen? No, I can’t say I am.”\\n\\n“Will you read this letter, M. Renauld? And tell me if you have any\\nidea as to who the person was who addressed it to your father?”\\n\\nJack Renauld took the letter, and read it through, the colour mounting\\nin his face as he did so.\\n\\n“Addressed to my father?” The emotion and indignation in his tones were\\nevident.\\n\\n“Yes. We found it in the pocket of his coat.”\\n\\n“Does—” He hesitated, throwing the merest fraction of a glance towards\\nhis mother. The magistrate understood.\\n\\n“As yet—no. Can you give us any clue as to the writer?”\\n\\n“I have no idea whatsoever.”\\n\\nM. Hautet sighed.\\n\\n“A most mysterious case. Ah, well, I suppose we can now rule out the\\nletter altogether. What do you think, M. Giraud? It does not seem to\\nlead us anywhere.”\\n\\n“It certainly does not,” agreed the detective with emphasis.\\n\\n“And yet,” sighed the magistrate, “it promised at the beginning to be\\nsuch a beautiful and simple case!” He caught Mrs. Renauld’s eye, and\\nblushed in immediate confusion. “Ah, yes,” he coughed, turning over the\\npapers on the table. “Let me see, where were we? Oh, the weapon. I fear\\nthis may give you pain, M. Renauld. I understand it was a present from\\nyou to your mother. Very sad—very distressing—”\\n\\nJack Renauld leaned forward. His face, which had flushed during the\\nperusal of the letter, was now deadly white.\\n\\n“Do you mean—that it was with an aeroplane wire paper cutter that my\\nfather was—was killed? But it’s impossible! A little thing like that!”\\n\\n“Alas, M. Renauld, it is only too true! An ideal little tool, I fear.\\nSharp and easy to handle.”\\n\\n“Where is it? Can I see it? Is it still in the—the body?”\\n\\n“Oh, no, it had been removed. You would like to see it? To make sure?\\nIt would be as well, perhaps, though madame has already identified it.\\nStill—M. Bex, might I trouble you?”\\n\\n“Certainly, M. le juge. I will fetch it immediately.”\\n\\n“Would it not be better to take M. Renauld to the shed?” suggested\\nGiraud smoothly. “Without doubt he would wish to see his father’s\\nbody.”\\n\\nThe boy made a shivering gesture of negation, and the magistrate,\\nalways disposed to cross Giraud whenever possible, replied.\\n\\n“But no—not at present. M. Bex will be so kind as to bring it to us\\nhere.”\\n\\nThe commissary left the room. Stonor crossed to Jack, and wrung him by\\nthe hand. Poirot had risen and was adjusting a pair of candlesticks\\nthat struck his trained eye as being a shade askew. The magistrate was\\nreading the mysterious love-letter through a last time, clinging\\ndesperately to his first theory of jealousy and a stab in the back.\\n\\nSuddenly the door burst open and the commissary rushed in.\\n\\n“M. le juge! M. le juge!”\\n\\n“But yes. What is it?”\\n\\n“The dagger! It is gone!”\\n\\n“_Comment___—gone?”\\n\\n“Vanished. Disappeared. The glass jar that contained it is empty!”\\n\\n“What?” I cried. “Impossible. Why, only this morning I saw—” The words\\ndied on my tongue.\\n\\nBut the attention of the entire room was diverted to me.\\n\\n“What is that you say?” cried the commissary. “This morning?”\\n\\n“I saw it there this morning,” I said slowly. “About an hour and a half\\nago, to be accurate.”\\n\\n“You went to the shed, then? How did you get the key?”\\n\\n“I asked the _sergent de ville___ for it.”\\n\\n“And you went there? Why?”\\n\\nI hesitated, but in the end I decided that the only thing to do was to\\nmake a clean breast of it.\\n\\n“M. le juge,” I said. “I have committed a grave fault, for which I must\\ncrave your indulgence.”\\n\\n“_Eh bien!___ Proceed, monsieur.”\\n\\n“The fact of the matter is,” I said, wishing myself anywhere else than\\nwhere I was, “that I met a young lady, an acquaintance of mine. She\\ndisplayed a great desire to see everything that was to be seen, and\\nI—well, in short, I took the key to show her the body.”\\n\\n“Ah, _par exemple___,” cried the magistrate indignantly. “But it is a\\ngrave fault you have committed there, Captain Hastings. It is\\naltogether most irregular. You should not have permitted yourself this\\nfolly.”\\n\\n“I know,” I said meekly. “Nothing that you can say could be too severe,\\nM. le juge.”\\n\\n“You did not invite this lady to come here?”\\n\\n“Certainly not. I met her quite by accident. She is an English lady who\\nhappens to be staying in Merlinville, though I was not aware of that\\nuntil my unexpected meeting with her.”\\n\\n“Well, well,” said the magistrate, softening. “It was most irregular,\\nbut the lady is without doubt young and beautiful, _n’est-ce pas?___\\nWhat it is to be young! _O jeunesse, jeunesse!___” And he sighed\\nsentimentally.\\n\\nBut the commissary, less romantic, and more practical, took up the\\ntale:\\n\\n“But did not you reclose and lock the door when you departed.”\\n\\n“That’s just it,” I said slowly. “That’s what I blame myself for so\\nterribly. My friend was upset at the sight. She nearly fainted. I got\\nher some brandy and water, and afterwards insisted on accompanying her\\nback to town. In the excitement, I forgot to relock the door. I only\\ndid so when I got back to the Villa.”\\n\\n“Then for twenty minutes at least—” said the commissary slowly. He\\nstopped.\\n\\n“Exactly,” I said.\\n\\n“Twenty minutes,” mused the commissary.\\n\\n“It is deplorable,” said M. Hautet, his sternness of manner returning.\\n“Without precedent.”\\n\\nSuddenly another voice spoke.\\n\\n“You find it deplorable, M. le juge?” asked Giraud.\\n\\n“Certainly I do.”\\n\\n“_Eh bien!___ I find it admirable,” said the other imperturbably.\\n\\nThis unexpected ally quite bewildered me.\\n\\n“Admirable, M. Giraud?” asked the magistrate, studying him cautiously\\nout of the corner of his eye.\\n\\n“Precisely.”\\n\\n“And why?”\\n\\n“Because we know now that the assassin, or an accomplice of the\\nassassin, has been near the Villa only an hour ago. It will be strange\\nif, with that knowledge, we do not shortly lay hands upon him.” There\\nwas a note of menace in his voice. He continued: “He risked a good deal\\nto gain possession of that dagger. Perhaps he feared that finger-prints\\nmight be discovered on it.”\\n\\nPoirot turned to Bex.\\n\\n“You said there were none?”\\n\\nGiraud shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n“Perhaps he could not be sure.”\\n\\nPoirot looked at him.\\n\\n“You are wrong, M. Giraud. The assassin wore gloves. So he must have\\nbeen sure.”\\n\\n“I do not say it was the assassin himself. It may have been an\\naccomplice who was not aware of that fact.”\\n\\n“_Ils sont mal renseignés, les accomplices!___” muttered Poirot, but he\\nsaid no more.\\n\\nThe magistrate’s clerk was gathering up the papers on the table. M.\\nHautet addressed us:\\n\\n“Our work here is finished. Perhaps, M. Renauld, you will listen whilst\\nyour evidence is read over to you. I have purposely kept all the\\nproceedings as informal as possible. I have been called original in my\\nmethods, but I maintain that there is much to be said for originality.\\nThe case is now in the clever hands of the renowned M. Giraud. He will\\nwithout doubt distinguish himself. Indeed, I wonder that he has not\\nalready laid his hands upon the murderers! Madame, again let me assure\\nyou of my heart-felt sympathy. Messieurs, I wish you all good day.”\\nAnd, accompanied by his clerk and the commissary, he took his\\ndeparture.\\n\\nPoirot tugged out that large turnip of a watch of his, and observed the\\ntime.\\n\\n“Let us return to the hotel for lunch, my friend,” he said. “And you\\nshall recount to me in full the indiscretions of this morning. No one\\nis observing us. We need make no adieux.”\\n\\nWe went quietly out of the room. The examining magistrate had just\\ndriven off in his car. I was going down the steps when Poirot’s voice\\narrested me:\\n\\n“One little moment, my friend.” Dexterously, he whipped out his yard\\nmeasure, and proceeded, quite solemnly, to measure an overcoat hanging\\nin the hall from the collar to the hem. I had not seen it hanging there\\nbefore, and guessed that it belonged to either Mr. Stonor, or Jack\\nRenauld.\\n\\nThen, with a little satisfied grunt, Poirot returned the measure to his\\npocket, and followed me out into the open air.\\n\\n\\n\\n12 Poirot Elucidates Certain Points\\n\\n“Why did you measure that overcoat?” I asked, with some curiosity, as\\nwe walked down the hot white road at a leisurely pace.\\n\\n“_Parbleu!___ to see how long it was,” replied my friend imperturbably.\\n\\nI was vexed. Poirot’s incurable habit of making a mystery out of\\nnothing never failed to irritate me. I relapsed into silence, and\\nfollowed a train of thought of my own. Although I had not noticed them\\nspecially at the time, certain words Mrs. Renauld had addressed to her\\nson now recurred to me, fraught with a new significance. “So you did\\nnot sail?” she had said, and then had added: “_After all, it does not\\nmatter—now.___”\\n\\nWhat had she meant by that? The words were enigmatical—significant. Was\\nit possible that she knew more than we supposed? She had denied all\\nknowledge of the mysterious mission with which her husband was to have\\nentrusted his son. But was she really less ignorant than she pretended?\\nCould she enlighten us if she chose, and was her silence part of a\\ncarefully thought out and preconceived plan?\\n\\nThe more I thought about it, the more I was convinced that I was right.\\nMrs. Renauld knew more than she chose to tell. In her surprise at\\nseeing her son, she had momentarily betrayed herself. I felt convinced\\nthat she knew, if not the assassins, at least the motive for the\\nassassination. But some very powerful considerations must keep her\\nsilent.\\n\\n“You think profoundly, my friend,” remarked Poirot, breaking in upon my\\nreflections. “What is it that intrigues you so?”\\n\\nI told him, sure of my ground, though feeling expectant that he would\\nridicule my suspicions. But to my surprise he nodded thoughtfully.\\n\\n“You are quite right, Hastings. From the beginning I have been sure\\nthat she was keeping something back. At first I suspected her, if not\\nof inspiring, at least of conniving at the crime.”\\n\\n“You suspected _her?___” I cried.\\n\\n“But certainly! She benefits enormously—in fact, by this new will, she\\nis the only person to benefit. So, from the start, she was singled out\\nfor attention. You may have noticed that I took an early opportunity of\\nexamining her wrists. I wished to see whether there was any possibility\\nthat she had gagged and bound herself. _Eh bien___, I saw at once that\\nthere was no fake, the cords had actually been drawn so tight as to cut\\ninto the flesh. That ruled out the possibility of her having committed\\nthe crime single-handed. But it was still possible for her to have\\nconnived at it, or to have been the instigator with an accomplice.\\nMoreover, the story, as she told it, was singularly familiar to me—the\\nmasked men that she could not recognize, the mention of ‘the secret’—I\\nhad heard, or read, all these things before. Another little detail\\nconfirmed my belief that she was not speaking the truth. _The wrist\\nwatch, Hastings, the wrist watch!___”\\n\\nAgain that wrist watch! Poirot was eyeing me curiously.\\n\\n“You see, _mon ami?___ You comprehend?”\\n\\n“No,” I replied with some ill humour. “I neither see nor comprehend.\\nYou make all these confounded mysteries, and it’s useless asking you to\\nexplain. You always like keeping everything up your sleeve to the last\\nminute.”\\n\\n“Do not enrage yourself, my friend,” said Poirot with a smile. “I will\\nexplain if you wish. But not a word to Giraud, _c’est entendu?___ He\\ntreats me as an old one of no importance! _We shall see!___ In common\\nfairness I gave him a hint. If he does not choose to act upon it, that\\nis his own look out.”\\n\\nI assured Poirot that he could rely upon my discretion.\\n\\n“_C’est bien!___ Let us then employ our little grey cells. Tell me, my\\nfriend, at what time, according to you, did the tragedy take place?”\\n\\n“Why, at two o’clock or thereabouts,” I said, astonished. “You\\nremember, Mrs. Renauld told us that she heard the clock strike while\\nthe men were in the room.”\\n\\n“Exactly, and on the strength of that, you, the examining magistrate,\\nBex, and every one else, accept the time without further question. But\\nI, Hercule Poirot, say that Madame Renauld lied. _The crime took place\\nat least two hours earlier.___”\\n\\n“But the doctors—”\\n\\n“They declared, after examination of the body, that death had taken\\nplace between ten and seven hours previously. _Mon ami___, for some\\nreason, it was imperative that the crime should seem to have taken\\nplace later than it actually did. You have read of a smashed watch or\\nclock recording the exact hour of a crime? So that the time should not\\nrest on Mrs. Renauld’s testimony alone, some one moved on the hands of\\nthat wrist watch to two o’clock, and then dashed it violently to the\\nground. But, as is often the case, they defeated their own object. The\\nglass was smashed, but the mechanism of the watch was uninjured. It was\\na most disastrous manoeuvre on their part, for it at once drew my\\nattention to two points—first, that Madame Renauld was lying: secondly,\\nthat there must be some vital reason for the postponement of the time.”\\n\\n“But what reason could there be?”\\n\\n“Ah, that is the question! There we have the whole mystery. As yet, I\\ncannot explain it. There is only one idea that presents itself to me as\\nhaving a possible connection.”\\n\\n“And that is?”\\n\\n“The last train left Merlinville at seventeen minutes past twelve.”\\n\\nI followed it out slowly.\\n\\n“So that, the crime apparently taking place some two hours later, any\\none leaving by that train would have an unimpeachable alibi!”\\n\\n“Perfect, Hastings! You have it!”\\n\\nI sprang up.\\n\\n“But we must inquire at the station. Surely they cannot have failed to\\nnotice two foreigners who left by that train! We must go there at\\nonce!”\\n\\n“You think so, Hastings?”\\n\\n“Of course. Let us go there now.”\\n\\nPoirot restrained my ardour with a light touch upon the arm.\\n\\n“Go by all means if you wish, _mon ami___—but if you go, I should not\\nask for particulars of two foreigners.”\\n\\nI stared, and he said rather impatiently:\\n\\n“Là, là, you do not believe all that rigmarole, do you? The masked men\\nand all the rest of _cette histoire-là!___”\\n\\nHis words took me so much aback that I hardly knew how to respond. He\\nwent on serenely:\\n\\n“You heard me say to Giraud, did you not, that all the details of this\\ncrime were familiar to me? _Eh bien___, that presupposes one of two\\nthings, either the brain that planned the first crime also planned this\\none, or else an account read of a _cause célèbre___ unconsciously\\nremained in our assassin’s memory and prompted the details. I shall be\\nable to pronounce definitely on that after—” he broke off.\\n\\nI was revolving sundry matters in my mind.\\n\\n“But Mr. Renauld’s letter? It distinctly mentions a secret and\\nSantiago?”\\n\\n“Undoubtedly there was a secret in M. Renauld’s life—there can be no\\ndoubt of that. On the other hand, the word Santiago, to my mind, is a\\nred herring, dragged continually across the track to put us off the\\nscent. It is possible that it was used in the same way on M. Renauld,\\nto keep him from directing his suspicions into a quarter nearer at\\nhand. Oh, be assured, Hastings, the danger that threatened him was not\\nin Santiago, it was near at hand, in France.”\\n\\nHe spoke so gravely, and with such assurance, that I could not fail to\\nbe convinced. But I essayed one final objection:\\n\\n“And the match and cigarette end found near the body? What of them.”\\n\\nA light of pure enjoyment lit up Poirot’s face.\\n\\n“Planted! Deliberately planted there for Giraud or one of his tribe to\\nfind! Ah, he is smart, Giraud, he can do his tricks! So can a good\\nretriever dog. He comes in so pleased with himself. For hours he has\\ncrawled on his stomach. ‘See what I have found,’ he says. And then\\nagain to me: ‘What do you see here?’ Me, I answer, with profound and\\ndeep truth, ‘Nothing.’ And Giraud, the great Giraud, he laughs, he\\nthinks to himself, ‘Oh, that he is imbecile, this old one!’ _But we\\nshall see.\\u200a…___”\\n\\nBut my mind had reverted to the main facts.\\n\\n“Then all this story of the masked men—?”\\n\\n“Is false.”\\n\\n“What really happened?”\\n\\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n“One person could tell us—Madame Renauld. But she will not speak.\\nThreats and entreaties would not move her. A remarkable woman that,\\nHastings. I recognized as soon as I saw her that I had to deal with a\\nwoman of unusual character. At first, as I told you, I was inclined to\\nsuspect her of being concerned in the crime. Afterwards I altered my\\nopinion.”\\n\\n“What made you do that?”\\n\\n“Her spontaneous and genuine grief at the sight of her husband’s body.\\nI could swear that the agony in that cry of hers was genuine.”\\n\\n“Yes,” I said thoughtfully, “one cannot mistake these things.”\\n\\n“I beg your pardon, my friend—one can always be mistaken. Regard a\\ngreat actress, does not her acting of grief carry you away and impress\\nyou with its reality? No, however strong my own impression and belief,\\nI needed other evidence before I allowed myself to be satisfied. The\\ngreat criminal can be a great actor. I base my certainty in this case,\\nnot upon my own impression, but upon the undeniable fact that Mrs.\\nRenauld actually fainted. I turned up her eyelids and felt her pulse.\\nThere was no deception—the swoon was genuine. Therefore I was satisfied\\nthat her anguish was real and not assumed. Besides, a small additional\\npoint not without interest, it was unnecessary for Mrs. Renauld to\\nexhibit unrestrained grief. She had had one paroxysm on learning of her\\nhusband’s death, and there would be no need for her to simulate another\\nsuch a violent one on beholding his body. No, Mrs. Renauld was not her\\nhusband’s murderess. But why has she lied? She lied about the wrist\\nwatch, she lied about the masked men—she lied about a third thing. Tell\\nme, Hastings, what is your explanation of the open door?”\\n\\n“Well,” I said, rather embarrassed, “I suppose it was an oversight.\\nThey forgot to shut it.”\\n\\nPoirot shook his head, and sighed.\\n\\n“That is the explanation of Giraud. It does not satisfy me. There is a\\nmeaning behind that open door which for a moment I cannot fathom.”\\n\\n“I have an idea,” I cried suddenly.\\n\\n“_A la bonne heure!___ Let us hear it.”\\n\\n“Listen. We are agreed that Mrs. Renauld’s story is a fabrication. Is\\nit not possible, then, that Mr. Renauld left the house to keep an\\nappointment—possibly with the murderer—leaving the front door open for\\nhis return. But he did not return, and the next morning he is found,\\nstabbed in the back.”\\n\\n“An admirable theory, Hastings, but for two facts which you have\\ncharacteristically overlooked. In the first place, who gagged and bound\\nMadame Renauld? And why on earth should they return to the house to do\\nso? In the second place, no man on earth would go out to keep an\\nappointment wearing his underclothes and an overcoat. There are\\ncircumstances in which a man might wear pajamas and an overcoat—but the\\nother, never!”\\n\\n“True,” I said, rather crest-fallen.\\n\\n“No,” continued Poirot, “we must look elsewhere for a solution of the\\nopen door mystery. One thing I am fairly sure of—they did not leave\\nthrough the door. They left by the window.”\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“Precisely.”\\n\\n“But there were no footmarks in the flower bed underneath.”\\n\\n“No—_and there ought to have been.___ Listen, Hastings. The gardener,\\nAuguste, as you heard him say, planted both those beds the preceding\\nafternoon. In the one there are plentiful impressions of his big\\nhobnailed boots—in the other, _none!___ You see? Some one had passed\\nthat way, some one who, to obliterate their footprints, smoothed over\\nthe surface of the bed with a rake.”\\n\\n“Where did they get a rake?”\\n\\n“Where they got the spade and the gardening gloves,” said Poirot\\nimpatiently. “There is no difficulty about that.”\\n\\n“What makes you think that they left that way, though? Surely it is\\nmore probable that they entered by the window, and left by the door.”\\n\\n“That is possible of course. Yet I have a strong idea that they left by\\nthe window.”\\n\\n“I think you are wrong.”\\n\\n“Perhaps, _mon ami___.”\\n\\nI mused, thinking over the new field of conjecture that Poirot’s\\ndeductions had opened up to me. I recalled my wonder at his cryptic\\nallusions to the flower bed and the wrist watch. His remarks had seemed\\nso meaningless at the moment and now, for the first time, I realized\\nhow remarkably, from a few slight incidents, he had unravelled much of\\nthe mystery that surrounded the case. I paid a belated homage to my\\nfriend. As though he read my thoughts, he nodded sagely.\\n\\n“Method, you comprehend! Method! Arrange your facts. Arrange your\\nideas. And if some little fact will not fit in—do not reject it but\\nconsider it closely. Though its significance escapes you, be sure that\\nit is significant.”\\n\\n“In the meantime,” I said, considering, “although we know a great deal\\nmore than we did, we are no nearer to solving the mystery of who killed\\nMr. Renauld.”\\n\\n“No,” said Poirot cheerfully. “In fact we are a great deal further\\noff.”\\n\\nThe fact seemed to afford him such peculiar satisfaction that I gazed\\nat him in wonder. He met my eye and smiled.\\n\\n“But yes, it is better so. Before, there was at all events a clear\\ntheory as to how and by whose hands he met his death. Now that is all\\ngone. We are in darkness. A hundred conflicting points confuse and\\nworry us. That is well. That is excellent. Out of confusion comes forth\\norder. But if you find order to start with, if a crime seems simple and\\nabove-board, _eh bien, méfiez vous!___ It is, how do you say\\nit?—_cooked!___ The great criminal is simple—but very few criminals\\n_are___ great. In trying to cover up their tracks, they invariably\\nbetray themselves. Ah, _mon ami___, I would that some day I could meet\\na really great criminal—one who commits his crime, and then—does\\nnothing! Even I, Hercule Poirot, might fail to catch such a one.”\\n\\nBut I had not followed his words. A light had burst upon me.\\n\\n“Poirot! Mrs. Renauld! I see it now. She must be shielding somebody.”\\n\\nFrom the quietness with which Poirot received my remark, I could see\\nthat the idea had already occurred to him.\\n\\n“Yes,” he said thoughtfully. “Shielding some one—or screening some one.\\nOne of the two.”\\n\\nI saw very little difference between the two words, but I developed my\\ntheme with a good deal of earnestness. Poirot maintained a strictly\\nnon-committal attitude, repeating:\\n\\n“It may be—yes, it may be. But as yet I do not know! There is something\\nvery deep underneath all this. You will see. Something very deep.”\\n\\nThen, as we entered our hotel, he enjoined silence on me with a\\ngesture.\\n\\n\\n\\n13 The Girl with the Anxious Eyes\\n\\nWe lunched with an excellent appetite. I understood well enough that\\nPoirot did not wish to discuss the tragedy where we could so easily be\\noverheard. But, as is usual when one topic fills the mind to the\\nexclusion of everything else, no other subject of interest seemed to\\npresent itself. For a while we ate in silence, and then Poirot observed\\nmaliciously:\\n\\n“_Eh bien!___ And your indiscretions! You recount them not?”\\n\\nI felt myself blushing.\\n\\n“Oh, you mean this morning?” I endeavoured to adopt a tone of absolute\\nnonchalance.\\n\\nBut I was no match for Poirot. In a very few minutes he had extracted\\nthe whole story from me, his eyes twinkling as he did so.\\n\\n“_Tiens!___ A story of the most romantic. What is her name, this\\ncharming young lady?”\\n\\nI had to confess that I did not know.\\n\\n“Still more romantic! The first _rencontre___ in the train from Paris,\\nthe second here. Journeys end in lovers’ meetings, is not that the\\nsaying?”\\n\\n“Don’t be an ass, Poirot.”\\n\\n“Yesterday it was Mademoiselle Daubreuil, today it is\\nMademoiselle—Cinderella! Decidedly you have the heart of a Turk,\\nHastings! You should establish a harem!”\\n\\n“It’s all very well to rag me. Mademoiselle Daubreuil is a very\\nbeautiful girl, and I do admire her immensely—I don’t mind admitting\\nit. The other’s nothing—don’t suppose I shall ever see her again. She\\nwas quite amusing to talk to just for a railway journey, but she’s not\\nthe kind of girl I should ever get keen on.”\\n\\n“Why?”\\n\\n“Well—it sounds snobbish perhaps—but she’s not a lady, not in any sense\\nof the word.”\\n\\nPoirot nodded thoughtfully. There was less raillery in his voice as he\\nasked:\\n\\n“You believe, then, in birth and breeding?”\\n\\n“I may be old-fashioned, but I certainly don’t believe in marrying out\\nof one’s class. It never answers.”\\n\\n“I agree with you, _mon ami___. Ninety-nine times out of a hundred, it\\nis as you say. But there is always the hundredth time! Still, that does\\nnot arise, as you do not propose to see the lady again.”\\n\\nHis last words were almost a question, and I was aware of the sharpness\\nwith which he darted a glance at me. And before my eyes, writ large in\\nletters of fire, I saw the words “Hôtel du Phare,” and I heard again\\nher voice saying “Come and look me up” and my own answering with\\n_empressement___: “I will.”\\n\\nWell, what of it? I had meant to go at the time. But since then, I had\\nhad time to reflect. I did not like the girl. Thinking it over in cold\\nblood, I came definitely to the conclusion that I disliked her\\nintensely. I had got hauled over the coals for foolishly gratifying her\\nmorbid curiosity, and I had not the least wish to see her again.\\n\\nI answered Poirot lightly enough.\\n\\n“She asked me to look her up, but of course I shan’t.”\\n\\n“Why ‘of course’?”\\n\\n“Well—I don’t want to.”\\n\\n“I see.” He studied me attentively for some minutes. “Yes. I see very\\nwell. And you are wise. Stick to what you have said.”\\n\\n“That seems to be your invariable advice,” I remarked, rather piqued.\\n\\n“Ah, my friend, have faith in Papa Poirot. Some day, if you permit, I\\nwill arrange you a marriage of great suitability.”\\n\\n“Thank you,” I said laughing, “but the prospect leaves me cold.”\\n\\nPoirot sighed and shook his head.\\n\\n“_Les Anglais!___” he murmured. “No method—absolutely none whatever.\\nThey leave all to chance!” He frowned, and altered the position of the\\nsalt cellar.\\n\\n“Mademoiselle Cinderella is staying at the Hôtel d’Angleterre you told\\nme, did you not?”\\n\\n“No. Hôtel du Phare.”\\n\\n“True, I forgot.”\\n\\nA moment’s misgiving shot across my mind. Surely I had never mentioned\\nany hotel to Poirot. I looked across at him, and felt reassured. He was\\ncutting his bread into neat little squares, completely absorbed in his\\ntask. He must have fancied I had told him where the girl was staying.\\n\\nWe had coffee outside facing the sea. Poirot smoked one of his tiny\\ncigarettes, and then drew his watch from his pocket.\\n\\n“The train to Paris leaves at 2:25,” he observed. “I should be\\nstarting.”\\n\\n“Paris?” I cried.\\n\\n“That is what I said, _mon ami___.”\\n\\n“You are going to Paris? But why?”\\n\\nHe replied very seriously.\\n\\n“To look for the murderer of M. Renauld.”\\n\\n“You think he is in Paris?”\\n\\n“I am quite certain that he is not. Nevertheless, it is there that I\\nmust look for him. You do not understand, but I will explain it all to\\nyou in good time. Believe me, this journey to Paris is necessary. I\\nshall not be away long. In all probability I shall return tomorrow. I\\ndo not propose that you should accompany me. Remain here and keep an\\neye on Giraud. Also cultivate the society of M. Renauld _fils___. And\\nthirdly, if you wish, endeavour to cut him out with Mademoiselle\\nMarthe. But I fear you will not have great success.”\\n\\nI did not quite relish the last remark.\\n\\n“That reminds me,” I said. “I meant to ask you how you knew about those\\ntwo?”\\n\\n“_Mon ami___—I know human nature. Throw together a boy young Renauld\\nand a beautiful girl like Mademoiselle Marthe, and the result is almost\\ninevitable. Then, the quarrel! It was money or a woman and, remembering\\nLéonie’s description of the lad’s anger, I decided on the latter. So I\\nmade my guess—and I was right.”\\n\\n“And that was why you warned me against setting my heart on the lady?\\nYou already suspected that she loved young Renauld?”\\n\\nPoirot smiled.\\n\\n“At any rate—_I saw that she had anxious eyes.___ That is how always\\nthink of Mademoiselle Daubreuil _as the girl with the anxious\\neyes.\\u200a…___”\\n\\nHis voice was so grave that it impressed me uncomfortably.\\n\\n“What do you mean by that, Poirot?”\\n\\n“I fancy, my friend, that we shall see before very long. But I must\\nstart.”\\n\\n“You’ve oceans of time.”\\n\\n“Perhaps—perhaps. But I like plenty of leisure at the station. I do not\\nwish to rush, to hurry, to excite myself.”\\n\\n“At all events,” I said, rising, “I will come and see you off.”\\n\\n“You will do nothing of the sort. I forbid it.”\\n\\nHe was so peremptory that I stared at him in surprise. He nodded\\nemphatically.\\n\\n“I mean it, _mon ami___. Au revoir! You permit that I embrace you? Ah,\\nno, I forget that it is not the English custom. Une poignee de main,\\nalors.”\\n\\nI felt rather at a loose end after Poirot had left me. I strolled down\\nthe beach, and watched the bathers, without feeling energetic enough to\\njoin them. I rather fancied that Cinderella might be disporting herself\\namongst them in some wonderful costume, but I saw no signs of her. I\\nstrolled aimlessly along the sands towards the further end of the town.\\nIt occurred to me that, after all, it would only be decent feeling on\\nmy part to inquire after the girl. And it would save trouble in the\\nend. The matter would then be finished with. There would be no need for\\nme to trouble about her any further. But, if I did not go at all, she\\nmight quite possibly come and look me up at the Villa. And that would\\nbe annoying in every way. Decidedly it would be better to pay a short\\ncall, in the course of which I could make it quite clear that I could\\ndo nothing further for her in my capacity of showman.\\n\\nAccordingly I left the beach, and walked inland. I soon found the Hôtel\\ndu Phare, a very unpretentious building. It was annoying in the extreme\\nnot to know the lady’s name and, to save my dignity, I decided to\\nstroll inside and look around. Probably I should find her in the\\nlounge. Merlinville was a small place, you left your hotel to go to the\\nbeach, and you left the beach to return to the hotel. There were no\\nother attractions. There was a Casino being built, but it was not yet\\ncompleted.\\n\\nI had walked the length of the beach without seeing her, therefore she\\nmust be in the hotel. I went in. Several people were sitting in the\\ntiny lounge, but my quarry was not amongst them. I looked into some\\nother rooms, but there was no sign of her. I waited for some time, till\\nmy impatience got the better of me. I took the concierge aside, and\\nslipped five francs into his hand.\\n\\n“I wish to see a lady who is staying here. A young English lady, small\\nand dark. I am not sure of her name.”\\n\\nThe man shook his head, and seemed to be suppressing a grin.\\n\\n“There is no such lady as you describe staying here.”\\n\\n“She is American possibly,” I suggested. These fellows are so stupid.\\n\\nBut the man continued to shake his head.\\n\\n“No, monsieur. There are only six or seven English and American ladies\\naltogether, and they are all much older than the lady you are seeking.\\nIt is not here that you will find her, monsieur.”\\n\\nHe was so positive that I felt doubts.\\n\\n“But the lady told me she was staying here.”\\n\\n“Monsieur must have made a mistake—or it is more likely the lady did,\\nsince there has been another gentleman here inquiring for her.”\\n\\n“What is that you say?” I cried, surprised.\\n\\n“But yes, monsieur. A gentleman who described her just as you have\\ndone.”\\n\\n“What was he like?”\\n\\n“He was a small gentleman, well dressed, very neat, very spotless, the\\nmoustache very stiff, the head of a peculiar shape, and the eyes\\ngreen.”\\n\\nPoirot! So that was why he refused to let me accompany him to the\\nstation. The impertinence of it! I would thank him not to meddle in my\\nconcerns. Did he fancy I needed a nurse to look after me? Thanking the\\nman, I departed, somewhat at a loss, and still much incensed with my\\nmeddlesome friend. I regretted that he was, for the moment, out of\\nreach. I should have enjoyed telling him what I thought of his\\nunwarranted interference. Had I not distinctly told him that I had no\\nintention of seeing the girl? Decidedly, one’s friends can be too\\nzealous!\\n\\nBut where was the lady? I set aside my wrath, and tried to puzzle it\\nout. Evidently, through inadvertence, she had named the wrong hotel.\\nThen another thought struck me. Was it inadvertence? Or had she\\ndeliberately withheld her name and given me the wrong address? The more\\nI thought about it, the more I felt convinced that this last surmise of\\nmine was right. For some reason or other she did not wish to let the\\nacquaintance ripen into friendship. And though half an hour earlier\\nthis had been precisely my own view, I did not enjoy having the tables\\nturned upon me. The whole affair was profoundly unsatisfactory, and I\\nwent up to the Villa Geneviève in a condition of distinct ill humour. I\\ndid not go to the house, but went up the path to the little bench by\\nthe shed, and sat there moodily enough.\\n\\nI was distracted from my thoughts by the sound of voices close at hand.\\nIn a second or two I realized that they came, not from the garden I was\\nin, but from the adjoining garden of the Villa Marguerite, and that\\nthey were approaching rapidly. A girl’s voice was speaking, a voice\\nthat I recognized as that of the beautiful Marthe.\\n\\n“_Chéri___,” she was saying, “is it really true? Are all our troubles\\nover.”\\n\\n“You know it, Marthe,” Jack Renauld replied. “Nothing can part us now,\\nbeloved. The last obstacle to our union is removed. Nothing can take\\nyou from me.”\\n\\n“Nothing?” the girl murmured. “Oh, Jack, Jack—I am afraid.”\\n\\nI had moved to depart, realizing that I was quite unintentionally\\neavesdropping. As I rose to my feet, I caught sight of them through a\\ngap in the hedge. They stood together facing me, the man’s arm round\\nthe girl, his eyes looking into hers. They were a splendid looking\\ncouple, the dark, well-knit boy, and the fair young goddess. They\\nseemed made for each other as they stood there, happy in spite of the\\nterrible tragedy that overshadowed their young lives.\\n\\nBut the girl’s face was troubled, and Jack Renauld seemed to recognize\\nit, as he held her closer to him and asked:\\n\\n“But what are you afraid of, darling? What is there to fear—now?”\\n\\nAnd then I saw the look in her eyes, the look Poirot had spoken of, as\\nshe murmured, so that I almost guessed at the words.\\n\\n“I am afraid—for _you___.\\u200a…”\\n\\nI did not hear young Renauld’s answer, for my attention was distracted\\nby an unusual appearance a little further down the hedge. There\\nappeared to be a brown bush there, which seemed odd, to say the least\\nof it, so early in the summer. I stepped along to investigate, but, at\\nmy advance, the brown bush withdrew itself precipitately, and faced me\\nwith a finger to its lips. It was Giraud.\\n\\nEnjoining caution, he led the way round the shed until we were out of\\near-shot.\\n\\n“What were you doing there?” I asked.\\n\\n“Exactly what you were doing—listening.”\\n\\n“But I was not there on purpose!”\\n\\n“Ah!” said Giraud. “I was.”\\n\\nAs always, I admired the man whilst disliking him. He looked me up and\\ndown with a sort of contemptuous disfavour.\\n\\n“You didn’t help matters by butting in. I might have heard something\\nuseful in a minute. What have you done with your old fossil?”\\n\\n“M. Poirot has gone to Paris,” I replied coldly.\\n\\n“And I can tell you, M. Giraud, that he is anything but an old fossil.\\nHe has solved many cases that have completely baffled the English\\npolice.”\\n\\n“Bah! The English police!” Giraud snapped his fingers disdainfully.\\n“They must be on a level with our examining magistrates. So he has gone\\nto Paris, has he? Well, a good thing. The longer he stays there, the\\nbetter. But what does he think he will find there?”\\n\\nI thought I read in the question a tinge of uneasiness. I drew myself\\nup.\\n\\n“That I am not at liberty to say,” I said quietly.\\n\\nGiraud subjected me to a piercing stare.\\n\\n“He has probably enough sense not to tell _you___,” he remarked rudely.\\n“Good afternoon. I’m busy.”\\n\\nAnd with that, he turned on his heel, and left me without ceremony.\\nMatters seemed at a standstill at the Villa Geneviève. Giraud evidently\\ndid not desire my company and, from what I had seen, it seemed fairly\\ncertain that Jack Renauld did not either.\\n\\nI went back to the town, had an enjoyable bath and returned to the\\nhotel. I turned in early, wondering whether the following day would\\nbring forth anything of interest.\\n\\nI was wholly unprepared for what it did bring forth. I was eating my\\npetit déjeuner in the dining-room, when the waiter, who had been\\ntalking to some one outside, came back in obvious excitement. He\\nhesitated for a minute, fidgeting with his napkin, and then burst out.\\n\\n“Monsieur will pardon me, but he is connected, is he not, with the\\naffair at the Villa Geneviève?’\\n\\n“Yes,” I said eagerly. “Why?”\\n\\n“Monsieur has not heard the news, though?”\\n\\n“What news?”\\n\\n“That there has been another murder there last night!”\\n\\n“_What?___”\\n\\nLeaving my breakfast, I caught up my hat and ran as fast as I could.\\nAnother murder—and Poirot away! What fatality. But who had been\\nmurdered?\\n\\nI dashed in at the gate. A group of the servants was in the drive,\\ntalking and gesticulating. I caught hold of Françoise.\\n\\n“What has happened?”\\n\\n“Oh, monsieur! monsieur! Another death! It is terrible. There is a\\ncurse upon the house. But yes, I say it, a curse! They should send for\\nM. le curé to bring some holy water. Never will I sleep another night\\nunder that roof. It might be my turn, who knows?”\\n\\nShe crossed herself.\\n\\n“Yes,” I cried, “but who has been killed?”\\n\\n“Do I know—me? A man—a stranger. They found him up there—in the\\nshed—not a hundred yards from where they found poor Monsieur. And that\\nis not all. He is stabbed—stabbed to the heart _with the same\\ndagger!___”\\n\\n\\n\\n14 The Second Body\\n\\nWaiting for no more, I turned and ran up the path to the shed. The two\\nmen on guard there stood aside to let me pass and, filled with\\nexcitement, I entered.\\n\\nThe light was dim, the place was a mere rough wooden erection to keep\\nold pots and tools in. I had entered impetuously, but on the threshold\\nI checked myself, fascinated by the spectacle before me.\\n\\nGiraud was on his hands and knees, a pocket torch in his hand with\\nwhich he was examining every inch of the ground. He looked up with a\\nfrown at my entrance, then his face relaxed a little in a sort of\\ngood-humoured contempt.\\n\\n“Ah, _c’est l’Anglais!___ Enter then. Let us see what you can make of\\nthis affair.”\\n\\nRather stung by his tone, I stooped my head, and passed in.\\n\\n“There he is,” said Giraud, flashing his torch to the far corner.\\n\\nI stepped across.\\n\\nThe dead man lay straight upon his back. He was of medium height,\\nswarthy of complexion, and possibly about fifty years of age. He was\\nneatly dressed in a dark blue suit, well cut and probably made by an\\nexpensive tailor, but not new. His face was terribly convulsed, and on\\nhis left side, just over the heart, the hilt of a dagger stood up,\\nblack and shining. I recognized it. It was the same dagger I had seen\\nreposing in the glass jar the preceding morning!\\n\\n“I’m expecting the doctor any minute,” explained Giraud. “Although we\\nhardly need him. There’s no doubt what the man died of. He was stabbed\\nto the heart, and death must have been pretty well instantaneous.”\\n\\n“When was it done? Last night?”\\n\\nGiraud shook his head.\\n\\n“Hardly. I don’t lay down the law on medical evidence, but the man’s\\nbeen dead well over twelve hours. When do you say you last saw that\\ndagger?”\\n\\n“About ten o’clock yesterday morning.”\\n\\n“Then I should be inclined to fix the crime as being done not long\\nafter that.”\\n\\n“But people were passing and repassing this shed continually.”\\n\\nGiraud laughed disagreeably.\\n\\n“You progress to a marvel! Who told you he was killed in this shed?”\\n\\n“Well—” I felt flustered. “I—I assumed it.”\\n\\n“Oh, what a fine detective! Look at him, _mon petit___—does a man\\nstabbed to the heart fall like that—neatly with his feet together, and\\nhis arms to his side? No. Again does a man lie down on his back and\\npermit himself to be stabbed without raising a hand to defend himself?\\nIt is absurd, is it not? But see here—and here—” He flashed the torch\\nalong the ground. I saw curious irregular marks in the soft dirt. “He\\nwas dragged here after he was dead. Half dragged, half carried by two\\npeople. Their tracks do not show on the hard ground outside, and here\\nthey have been careful to obliterate them—but one of the two was a\\nwoman, my young friend.”\\n\\n“A woman?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“But if the tracks are obliterated, how do you know?”\\n\\n“Because, blurred as they are, the prints of the woman’s shoe are\\nunmistakable. Also, by _this___—” And, leaning forward, he drew\\nsomething from the handle of the dagger and held it up for me to see.\\nIt was a woman’s long black hair—similar to the one Poirot had taken\\nfrom the arm-chair in the library.\\n\\nWith a slightly ironic smile he wound it round the dagger again.\\n\\n“We will leave things as they are as much as possible,” he explained.\\n“It pleases the examining magistrate. _Eh bien___, do you notice\\nanything else?”\\n\\nI was forced to shake my head.\\n\\n“Look at his hands.”\\n\\nI did. The nails were broken and discoloured, and the skin was hard. It\\nhardly enlightened me as much as I should have liked it to have done. I\\nlooked up at Giraud.\\n\\n“They are not the hands of a gentleman,” he said, answering my look.\\n“On the contrary his clothes are those of a well-to-do man. That is\\ncurious, is it not?”\\n\\n“Very curious,” I agreed.\\n\\n“And none of his clothing is marked. What do we learn from that? This\\nman was trying to pass himself off as other than he was. He was\\nmasquerading. Why? Did he fear something? Was he trying to escape by\\ndisguising himself? As yet we do not know, but one thing we do know—he\\nwas as anxious to conceal his identity as we are to discover it.”\\n\\nHe looked down at the body again.\\n\\n“As before there are no finger-prints on the handle of the dagger. The\\nmurderer again wore gloves.”\\n\\n“You think, then, that the murderer was the same in both cases?” I\\nasked eagerly.\\n\\nGiraud became inscrutable.\\n\\n“Never mind what I think. We shall see. Marchaud!”\\n\\nThe _sergent de ville___ appeared at the doorway.\\n\\n“Monsieur?”\\n\\n“Why is Madame Renauld not here? I sent for her a quarter of an hour\\nago?”\\n\\n“She is coming up the path now, monsieur, and her son with her.”\\n\\n“Good. I only want one at a time, though.”\\n\\nMarchaud saluted and disappeared again. A moment later he reappeared\\nwith Mrs. Renauld.\\n\\n“Here is Madame.”\\n\\nGiraud came forward with a curt bow.\\n\\n“This way, madame.” He led her across, and then, standing suddenly\\naside. “Here is the man. Do you know him?”\\n\\nAnd as he spoke, his eyes, gimlet-like, bored into her face, seeking to\\nread her mind, noting every indication of her manner.\\n\\nBut Mrs. Renauld remained perfectly calm—too calm, I felt. She looked\\ndown at the corpse almost without interest, certainly without any sign\\nof agitation or recognition.\\n\\n“No,” she said. “I have never seen him in my life. He is quite a\\nstranger to me.”\\n\\n“You are sure?”\\n\\n“Quite sure.”\\n\\n“You do not recognize in him one of your assailants, for instance?”\\n\\n“No,” she seemed to hesitate, as though struck by the idea. “No, I do\\nnot think so. Of course they wore beards—false ones the examining\\nmagistrate thought, but still—no.” Now she seemed to make her mind up\\ndefinitely. “I am sure neither of the two was this man.”\\n\\n“Very well, madame. That is all, then.”\\n\\nShe stepped out with head erect, the sun flashing on the silver threads\\nin her hair. Jack Renauld succeeded her. He, too, failed to identify\\nthe man, in a completely natural manner.\\n\\nGiraud merely grunted. Whether he was pleased or chagrined I could not\\ntell. He merely called to Marchaud:\\n\\n“You have got the other there?”\\n\\n“Yes, monsieur.”\\n\\n“Bring her in then.”\\n\\n“The other” was Madame Daubreuil. She came indignantly, protesting with\\nvehemence.\\n\\n“I object, monsieur! This is an outrage! What have I to do with all\\nthis?”\\n\\n“Madame,” said Giraud brutally, “I am investigating not one murder, but\\ntwo murders! For all I know you may have committed them both.”\\n\\n“How dare you?” she cried. “How dare you insult me by such a wild\\naccusation! It is infamous.”\\n\\n“Infamous, is it? What about this?” Stooping, he again detached the\\nhair, and held it up. “Do you see this, madame?” He advanced towards\\nher. “You permit that I see whether it matches?”\\n\\nWith a cry she started backwards, white to the lips.\\n\\n“It is false—I swear it. I know nothing of the crime—of either crime.\\nAny one who says I do lies! Ah! _mon Dieu___, what shall I do?”\\n\\n“Calm yourself, madame,” said Giraud coldly. “No one has accused you as\\nyet. But you will do well to answer my questions without more ado.”\\n\\n“Anything you wish, monsieur.”\\n\\n“Look at the dead man. Have you ever seen him before?”\\n\\nDrawing nearer, a little of the colour creeping back to her face,\\nMadame Daubreuil looked down at the victim with a certain amount of\\ninterest and curiosity. Then she shook her head.\\n\\n“I do not know him.”\\n\\nIt seemed impossible to doubt her, the words came so naturally. Giraud\\ndismissed her with a nod of the head. “You are letting her go?” I asked\\nin a low voice. “Is that wise? Surely that black hair is from her\\nhead.”\\n\\n“I do not need teaching my business,” said Giraud dryly. “She is under\\nsurveillance. I have no wish to arrest her as yet.”\\n\\nThen, frowning, he gazed down at the body.\\n\\n“Should you say that was a Spanish type at all?” he asked suddenly.\\n\\nI considered the face carefully.\\n\\n“No,” I said at last. “I should put him down as a Frenchman most\\ndecidedly.”\\n\\nGiraud gave a grunt of dissatisfaction.\\n\\n“Same here.”\\n\\nHe stood there for a moment, then with an imperative gesture he waved\\nme aside, and once more, on hands and knees, he continued his search of\\nthe floor of the shed. He was marvellous. Nothing escaped him. Inch by\\ninch he went over the floor, turning over pots, examining old sacks. He\\npounced on a bundle by the door, but it proved to be only a ragged coat\\nand trousers, and he flung it down again with a snarl. Two pairs of old\\ngloves interested him, but in the end he shook his head and laid them\\naside. Then he went back to the pots, methodically turning them over\\none by one. In the end, he rose to his feet, and shook his head\\nthoughtfully. He seemed baffled and perplexed. I think he had forgotten\\nmy presence.\\n\\nBut, at that moment, a stir and bustle was heard outside, and our old\\nfriend, the examining magistrate, accompanied by his clerk and M. Bex,\\nwith the doctor behind him, came bustling in.\\n\\n“But this is extraordinary, Mr. Giraud,” cried M. Hautet. “Another\\ncrime! Ah, we have not got to the bottom of this case. There is some\\ndeep mystery here. But who is the victim this time?”\\n\\n“That is just what nobody can tell us, M. le juge. He has not been\\nidentified.”\\n\\n“Where is the body?” asked the doctor.\\n\\nGiraud moved aside a little.\\n\\n“There in the corner. He has been stabbed to the heart, as you see. And\\nwith the dagger that was stolen yesterday morning. I fancy that the\\nmurder followed hard upon the theft—but that is for you to say. You can\\nhandle the dagger freely—there are no finger-prints on it.”\\n\\nThe doctor knelt down by the dead man, and Giraud turned to the\\nexamining magistrate.\\n\\n“A pretty little problem, is it not? But I shall solve it.”\\n\\n“And so no one can identify him,” mused the magistrate. “Could it\\npossibly be one of the assassins? They may have fallen out among\\nthemselves.”\\n\\nGiraud shook his head.\\n\\n“The man is a Frenchman—I would take my oath of that—”\\n\\nBut at that moment they were interrupted by the doctor who was sitting\\nback on his heels with a perplexed expression.\\n\\n“You say he was killed yesterday morning?”\\n\\n“I fix it by the theft of the dagger,” explained Giraud. “He may, of\\ncourse, have been killed later in the day.”\\n\\n“Later in the day? Fiddlesticks! This man has been dead at least\\nforty-eight hours, and probably longer.”\\n\\nWe stared at each other in blank amazement.\\n\\n\\n\\n15 A Photograph\\n\\nThe doctor’s words were so surprising that we were all momentarily\\ntaken aback. Here was a man stabbed with a dagger which we knew to have\\nbeen stolen only twenty-four hours previously, and yet Dr. Durand\\nasserted positively that he had been dead at least forty-eight hours!\\nThe whole thing was fantastic to the last extreme.\\n\\nWe were still recovering from the surprise of the doctor’s\\nannouncement, when a telegram was brought to me. It had been sent up\\nfrom the hotel to the Villa. I tore it open. It was from Poirot, and\\nannounced his return by the train arriving at Merlinville at 12:28.\\n\\nI looked at my watch and saw that I had just time to get comfortably to\\nthe station and meet him there. I felt that it was of the utmost\\nimportance that he should know at once of the new and startling\\ndevelopments in the case.\\n\\nEvidently, I reflected, Poirot had had no difficulty in finding what he\\nwanted in Paris. The quickness of his return proved that. Very few\\nhours had sufficed. I wondered how he would take the exciting news I\\nhad to impart.\\n\\nThe train was some minutes late, and I strolled aimlessly up and down\\nthe platform, until it occurred to me that I might pass the time by\\nasking a few questions as to who had left Merlinville by the last train\\non the evening of the tragedy.\\n\\nI approached the chief porter, an intelligent looking man, and had\\nlittle difficulty in persuading him to enter upon the subject. It was a\\ndisgrace to the Police, he hotly affirmed, that such brigands of\\nassassins should be allowed to go about unpunished. I hinted that there\\nwas some possibility they might have left by the midnight train, but he\\nnegatived the idea decidedly. He would have noticed two foreigners—he\\nwas sure of it. Only about twenty people had left by the train, and he\\ncould not have failed to observe them.\\n\\nI do not know what put the idea into my head—possibly it was the deep\\nanxiety underlying Marthe Daubreuil’s tones—but I asked suddenly:\\n\\n“Young M. Renauld—he did not leave by that train, did he?”\\n\\n“Ah, no, monsieur. To arrive and start off again within half an hour,\\nit would not be amusing, that!”\\n\\nI stared at the man, the significance of his words almost escaping me.\\nThen I saw.\\u200a…\\n\\n“You mean,” I said, my heart beating a little, “that M. Jack Renauld\\narrived at Merlinville that evening?”\\n\\n“But yes, monsieur. By the last train arriving the other way, the\\n11:40.”\\n\\nMy brain whirled. That, then, was the reason of Marthe’s poignant\\nanxiety. Jack Renauld had been in Merlinville on the night of the\\ncrime! But why had he not said so? Why, on the contrary, had he led us\\nto believe that he had remained in Cherbourg? Remembering his frank\\nboyish countenance, I could hardly bring myself to believe that he had\\nany connection with the crime. Yet why this silence on his part about\\nso vital a matter? One thing was certain, Marthe had known all along.\\nHence her anxiety, and her eager questioning of Poirot to know whether\\nany one were suspected.\\n\\nMy cogitations were interrupted by the arrival of the train, and in\\nanother moment I was greeting Poirot. The little man was radiant. He\\nbeamed and vociferated and, forgetting my English reluctance, embraced\\nme warmly on the platform.\\n\\n“_Mon cher ami___, I have succeeded—but succeeded to a marvel!”\\n\\n“Indeed? I’m delighted to hear it. Have you heard the latest here?”\\n\\n“How would you that I should hear anything? There have been some\\ndevelopments, eh? The brave Giraud, he has made an arrest? Or even\\narrests perhaps? Ah, but I will make him look foolish, that one! But\\nwhere are you taking me, my friend? Do we not go to the hotel? It is\\nnecessary that I attend to my moustaches—they are deplorably limp from\\nthe heat of travelling. Also, without doubt, there is dust on my coat.\\nAnd my tie, that I must rearrange.”\\n\\nI cut short his remonstrances.\\n\\n“My dear Poirot—never mind all that. We must go to the Villa at once.\\n_There has been another murder!___”\\n\\nI have frequently been disappointed when fancying that I was giving\\nnews of importance to my friend. Either he has known it already or he\\nhas dismissed it as irrelevant to the main issue—and in the latter case\\nevents have usually proved him justified. But this time I could not\\ncomplain of missing my effect. Never have I seen a man so\\nflabbergasted. His jaw dropped. All the jauntiness went out of his\\nbearing. He stared at me open-mouthed.\\n\\n“What is that you say? Another murder? Ah, then, I am all wrong. I have\\nfailed. Giraud may mock himself at me—he will have reason!”\\n\\n“You did not expect it, then?”\\n\\n“I? Not the least in the world. It demolishes my theory—it ruins\\neverything—it—ah, no!” He stopped dead, thumping himself on the chest.\\n“It is impossible. I _cannot___ be wrong! The facts, taken methodically\\nand in their proper order admit of only one explanation. I must be\\nright! I _am___ right!”\\n\\n“But then—”\\n\\nHe interrupted me.\\n\\n“Wait, my friend. I must be right, therefore this new murder is\\nimpossible unless—unless—oh, wait, I implore you. Say no word—”\\n\\nHe was silent for a moment or two, then, resuming his normal manner, he\\nsaid in a quiet assured voice: “The victim is a man of middle-age. His\\nbody was found in the locked shed near the scene of the crime and had\\nbeen dead at least forty-eight hours. And it is most probable that he\\nwas stabbed in a similar manner to M. Renauld, though not necessarily\\nin the back.”\\n\\nIt was my turn to gape—and gape I did. In all my knowledge of Poirot he\\nhad never done anything so amazing as this. And, almost inevitably, a\\ndoubt crossed my mind.\\n\\n“Poirot,” I cried, “you’re pulling my leg. You’ve heard all about it\\nalready.”\\n\\nHe turned his earnest gaze upon me reproachfully.\\n\\n“Would I do such a thing? I assure you that I have heard nothing\\nwhatsoever. Did you not observe the shock your news was to me?”\\n\\n“But how on earth could you know all that?”\\n\\n“I was right then? But I knew it. The little grey cells, my friend, the\\nlittle grey cells! They told me. Thus, and in no other way, could there\\nhave been a second death. Now tell me all. If we go round to the left\\nhere, we can take a short cut across the golf links which will bring us\\nto the back of the Villa Geneviève much more quickly.”\\n\\nAs we walked, taking the way he had indicated, I recounted all I knew.\\nPoirot listened attentively.\\n\\n“The dagger was in the wound, you say? That is curious. You are sure it\\nwas the same one?”\\n\\n“Absolutely certain. That’s what make it so impossible.”\\n\\n“Nothing is impossible. There may have been two daggers.”\\n\\nI raised my eyebrows.\\n\\n“Surely that is in the highest degree unlikely? It would be a most\\nextraordinary coincidence.”\\n\\n“You speak as usual, without reflection, Hastings. In some cases two\\nidentical weapons _would___ be highly improbable. But not here. This\\nparticular weapon was a war souvenir which was made to Jack Renauld’s\\norders. It is really highly unlikely, when you come to think of it,\\nthat he should have had only one made. Very probably he would have\\nanother for his own use.”\\n\\n“But nobody has mentioned such a thing,” I objected.\\n\\nA hint of the lecturer crept into Poirot’s tone. “My friend, in working\\nupon a case, one does not take into account only the things that are\\n‘mentioned.’ There is no reason to mention many things which may be\\nimportant. Equally, there is often an excellent reason for _not___\\nmentioning them. You can take your choice of the two motives.”\\n\\nI was silent, impressed in spite of myself. Another few minutes brought\\nus to the famous shed. We found all our friends there and, after an\\ninterchange of polite amenities, Poirot began his task.\\n\\nHaving watched Giraud at work, I was keenly interested. Poirot bestowed\\nbut a cursory glance on the surroundings. The only thing he examined\\nwas the ragged coat and trousers by the door. A disdainful smile rose\\nto Giraud’s lips, and, as though noting it, Poirot flung the bundle\\ndown again.\\n\\n“Old clothes of the gardener’s?” he queried.\\n\\n“Exactly,” said Giraud.\\n\\nPoirot knelt down by the body. His fingers were rapid but methodical.\\nHe examined the texture of the clothes, and satisfied himself that\\nthere were no marks on them. The boots he subjected to special care,\\nalso the dirty and broken finger-nails. Whilst examining the latter he\\nthrew a quick question at Giraud.\\n\\n“You saw these?”\\n\\n“Yes, I saw them,” replied the other. His face remained inscrutable.\\n\\nSuddenly Poirot stiffened.\\n\\n“Dr. Durand!”\\n\\n“Yes?” The doctor came forward.\\n\\n“There is foam on the lips. You observed it?”\\n\\n“I didn’t notice it, I must admit.”\\n\\n“But you observe it now?”\\n\\n“Oh, certainly.”\\n\\nPoirot again shot a question at Giraud.\\n\\n“You noticed it without doubt?”\\n\\nThe other did not reply. Poirot proceeded. The dagger had been\\nwithdrawn from the wound. It reposed in a glass jar by the side of the\\nbody. Poirot examined it, then he studied the wound closely. When he\\nlooked up, his eyes were excited, and shone with the green light I knew\\nso well.\\n\\n“It is a strange wound, this! It has not bled. There is no stain on the\\nclothes. The blade of the dagger is slightly discoloured, that is all.\\nWhat do you think, M. le docteur?”\\n\\n“I can only say that it is most abnormal.”\\n\\n“It is not abnormal at all. It is most simple. The man was stabbed\\n_after he was dead___.” And, stilling the clamour of voices that arose\\nwith a wave of his hand, Poirot turned to Giraud and added, “M. Giraud\\nagrees with me, do you not, monsieur?”\\n\\nWhatever Giraud’s real belief, he accepted the position without moving\\na muscle. Calmly and almost scornfully he replied:\\n\\n“Certainly I agree.”\\n\\nThe murmur of surprise and interest broke out again.\\n\\n“But what an idea!” cried M. Hautet. “To stab a man after he is dead!\\nBarbaric! Unheard of! Some unappeasable hate, perhaps.”\\n\\n“No, M. le juge,” said Poirot. “I should fancy it was done quite\\ncold-bloodedly—to create an impression.”\\n\\n“What impression?”\\n\\n“The impression it nearly did create,” returned Poirot oracularly.\\n\\nM. Bex had been thinking.\\n\\n“How, then, was the man killed?”\\n\\n“He was not killed. He died. He died, M. le juge, if I am not much\\nmistaken, of an epileptic fit!”\\n\\nThis statement of Poirot’s again aroused considerable excitement. Dr.\\nDurand knelt down again, and made a searching examination. At last he\\nrose to his feet.\\n\\n“Well, M. le docteur?”\\n\\n“M. Poirot, I am inclined to believe that you are correct in your\\nassertion. I was misled to begin with. The incontrovertible fact that\\nthe man had been stabbed distracted my attention from any other\\nindications.”\\n\\nPoirot was the hero of the hour. The examining magistrate was profuse\\nin compliments. Poirot responded gracefully, and then excused himself\\non the pretext that neither he nor I had yet lunched, and that he\\nwished to repair the ravages of the journey. As we were about to leave\\nthe shed, Giraud approached us.\\n\\n“One more thing, M. Poirot,” he said, in his suave mocking voice. “We\\nfound this coiled round the handle of the dagger. A woman’s hair.”\\n\\n“Ah!” said Poirot. “A woman’s hair? What woman’s, I wonder?”\\n\\n“I wonder also,” said Giraud. Then, with a bow, he left us.\\n\\n“He was insistent, the good Giraud,” said Poirot thoughtfully, as we\\nwalked towards the hotel. “I wonder in what direction he hopes to\\nmislead me? A woman’s hair—h’m!”\\n\\nWe lunched heartily, but I found Poirot somewhat distrait and\\ninattentive. Afterwards we went up to our sitting-room and there I\\nbegged him to tell me something of his mysterious journey to Paris.\\n\\n“Willingly, my friend. I went to Paris to find _this___.”\\n\\nHe took from his pocket a small faded newspaper cutting. It was the\\nreproduction of a woman’s photograph. He handed it to me. I uttered an\\nexclamation.\\n\\n“You recognize it, my friend?”\\n\\nI nodded. Although the photo obviously dated from very many years back,\\nand the hair was dressed in a different style, the likeness was\\nunmistakable.\\n\\n“Madame Daubreuil!” I exclaimed.\\n\\nPoirot shook his head with a smile.\\n\\n“Not quite correct, my friend. She did not call herself by that name in\\nthose days. That is a picture of the notorious Madame Beroldy!”\\n\\nMadame Beroldy! In a flash the whole thing came back to me. The murder\\ntrial that had evoked such world-wide interest.\\n\\n\\n_The Beroldy Case.___\\n\\n\\n\\n16 The Beroldy Case\\n\\nSome twenty years or so before the opening of the present story,\\nMonsieur Arnold Beroldy, a native of Lyons, arrived in Paris\\naccompanied by his pretty wife and their little daughter, a mere babe.\\nMonsieur Beroldy was a junior partner in a firm of wine merchants, a\\nstout middle-aged man, fond of the good things of life, devoted to his\\ncharming wife, and altogether unremarkable in every way. The firm in\\nwhich Monsieur Beroldy was a partner was a small one, and although\\ndoing well, it did not yield a large income to the junior partner. The\\nBeroldys had a small apartment and lived in a very modest fashion to\\nbegin with.\\n\\nBut unremarkable though Monsieur Beroldy might be, his wife was\\nplentifully gilded with the brush of Romance. Young and good looking,\\nand gifted withal with a singular charm of manner, Madame Beroldy at\\nonce created a stir in the quarter, especially when it began to be\\nwhispered that some interesting mystery surrounded her birth. It was\\nrumoured that she was the illegitimate daughter of a Russian Grand\\nDuke. Others asserted that it was an Austrian Archduke, and that the\\nunion was legal, though morganatic. But all stories agreed upon one\\npoint, that Jeanne Beroldy was the centre of an interesting mystery.\\nQuestioned by the curious, Madame Beroldy did not deny these rumours.\\nOn the other hand she let it be clearly understood that, though her\\n“lips” were “sealed,” all these stories had a foundation in fact. To\\nintimate friends she unburdened herself further, spoke of political\\nintrigues, of “papers,” of obscure dangers that threatened her. There\\nwas also much talk of Crown jewels that were to be sold secretly, with\\nherself acting as the go-between.\\n\\nAmongst the friends and acquaintances of the Beroldys was a young\\nlawyer, Georges Conneau. It was soon evident that the fascinating\\nJeanne had completely enslaved his heart. Madame Beroldy encouraged the\\nyoung man in a discreet fashion, but being always careful to affirm her\\ncomplete devotion to her middle-aged husband. Nevertheless, many\\nspiteful persons did not hesitate to declare that young Conneau was her\\nlover—and not the only one!\\n\\nWhen the Beroldys had been in Paris about three months, another\\npersonage came upon the scene. This was Mr. Hiram P. Trapp, a native of\\nthe United States, and extremely wealthy. Introduced to the charming\\nand mysterious Madame Beroldy, he fell a prompt victim to her\\nfascinations. His admiration was obvious, though strictly respectful.\\n\\nAbout this time, Madame Beroldy became more outspoken in her\\nconfidences. To several friends, she declared herself greatly worried\\non her husband’s behalf. She explained that he had been drawn into\\nseveral schemes of a political nature, and also referred to some\\nimportant papers that had been entrusted to him for safekeeping and\\nwhich concerned a “secret” of far reaching European importance. They\\nhad been entrusted to his custody to throw pursuers off the track, but\\nMadame Beroldy was nervous, having recognized several important members\\nof the Revolutionary Circle in Paris.\\n\\nOn the 28th day of November, the blow fell. The woman who came daily to\\nclean and cook for the Beroldys was surprised to find the door of the\\napartment standing wide open. Hearing faint moans issuing from the\\nbedroom, she went in. A terrible sight met her eyes. Madame Beroldy lay\\non the floor, bound hand and foot, uttering feeble moans, having\\nmanaged to free her mouth from a gag. On the bed was Monsieur Beroldy,\\nlying in a pool of blood, with a knife driven through his heart.\\n\\nMadame Beroldy’s story was clear enough. Suddenly awakened from sleep,\\nshe had discerned two masked men bending over her. Stifling her cries,\\nthey had bound and gagged her. They had then demanded of Monsieur\\nBeroldy the famous “secret.”\\n\\nBut the intrepid wine merchant refused point-blank to accede to their\\nrequest. Angered by his refusal, one of the men incontinently stabbed\\nhim through the heart. With the dead man’s keys, they had opened the\\nsafe in the corner, and had carried away with them a mass of papers.\\nBoth men were heavily bearded, and had worn masks, but Madame Beroldy\\ndeclared positively that they were Russians.\\n\\nThe affair created an immense sensation. It was referred to variously\\nas “the Nihilist Atrocity,” “Revolutionaries in Paris,” and the\\n“Russian Mystery.” Time went on, and the mysterious bearded men were\\nnever traced. And then, just as public interest was beginning to die\\ndown, a startling development occurred. Madame Beroldy was arrested and\\ncharged with the murder of her husband.\\n\\nThe trial, when it came on, aroused widespread interest. The youth and\\nbeauty of the accused, and her mysterious history, were sufficient to\\nmake of it a _cause célèbre___. People ranged themselves wildly for or\\nagainst the prisoner. But her partisans received several severe checks\\nto their enthusiasm. The romantic past of Madame Beroldy, her royal\\nblood, and the mysterious intrigues in which she had her being were\\nshown to be mere fantasies of the imagination.\\n\\nIt was proved beyond doubt that Jeanne Beroldy’s parents were a highly\\nrespectable and prosaic couple, fruit merchants, who lived on the\\noutskirts of Lyons. The Russian Grand Duke, the court intrigues, and\\nthe political schemes—all the stories current were traced back to—the\\nlady herself! From her brain had emanated these ingenious myths, and\\nshe was proved to have raised a considerable sum of money from various\\ncredulous persons by her fiction of the “Crown jewels”—the jewels in\\nquestion being found to be mere paste imitations. Remorselessly the\\nwhole story of her life was laid bare. The motive for the murder was\\nfound in Mr. Hiram P. Trapp. Mr. Trapp did his best, but relentlessly\\nand agilely cross-questioned he was forced to admit that he loved the\\nlady, and that, had she been free, he would have asked her to be his\\nwife. The fact that the relations between them were admittedly platonic\\nstrengthened the case against the accused. Debarred from becoming his\\nmistress by the simple honourable nature of the man, Jeanne Beroldy had\\nconceived the monstrous project of ridding herself of her elderly\\nundistinguished husband, and becoming the wife of the rich American.\\n\\nThroughout, Madame Beroldy confronted her accusers with complete sang\\nfroid and self possession. Her story never varied. She continued to\\ndeclare strenuously that she was of royal birth, and that she had been\\nsubstituted for the daughter of the fruit seller at an early age.\\nAbsurd and completely unsubstantiated as these statements were, a great\\nnumber of people believed implicitly in their truth.\\n\\nBut the prosecution was implacable. It denounced the masked “Russians”\\nas a myth, and asserted that the crime had been committed by Madame\\nBeroldy and her lover, Georges Conneau. A warrant was issued for the\\narrest of the latter, but he had wisely disappeared. Evidence showed\\nthat the bonds which secured Madame Beroldy were so loose that she\\ncould easily have freed herself.\\n\\nAnd then, towards the close of the trial, a letter, posted in Paris,\\nwas sent to the Public Prosecutor. It was from Georges Conneau and,\\nwithout revealing his whereabouts, it contained a full confession of\\nthe crime. He declared that he had indeed struck the fatal blow at\\nMadame Beroldy’s instigation. The crime had been planned between them.\\nBelieving that her husband ill-treated her, and maddened by his own\\npassion for her, a passion which he believed her to return, he had\\nplanned the crime and struck the fatal blow that should free the woman\\nhe loved from a hateful bondage. Now, for the first time, he learnt of\\nMr. Hiram P. Trapp, and realized that the woman he loved had betrayed\\nhim! Not for his sake did she wish to be free—but in order to marry the\\nwealthy American. She had used him as a cat’s-paw, and now, in his\\njealous rage, he turned and denounced her, declaring that throughout he\\nhad acted at her instigation.\\n\\nAnd then Madame Beroldy proved herself the remarkable woman she\\nundoubtedly was. Without hesitation, she dropped her previous defence,\\nand admitted that the “Russians” were a pure invention on her part. The\\nreal murderer was Georges Conneau. Maddened by passion, he had\\ncommitted the crime, vowing that if she did not keep silence he would\\nenact a terrible vengeance from her. Terrified by his threats, she had\\nconsented—also fearing it likely that if she told the truth she might\\nbe accused of conniving at the crime. But she had steadfastly refused\\nto have anything more to do with her husband’s murderer, and it was in\\nrevenge for this attitude on her part that he had written this letter\\naccusing her. She swore solemnly that she had had nothing to do with\\nthe planning of the crime, that she had awoke on that memorable night\\nto find Georges Conneau standing over her, the blood-stained knife in\\nhis hand.\\n\\nIt was a touch and go affair. Madame Beroldy’s story was hardly\\ncredible. But this woman, whose fairy tales of royal intrigues had been\\nso easily accepted, had the supreme art of making herself believed. Her\\naddress to the jury was a masterpiece. The tears streaming down her\\nface, she spoke of her child, of her woman’s honour—of her desire to\\nkeep her reputation untarnished for the child’s sake. She admitted\\nthat, Georges Conneau having been her lover, she might perhaps be held\\nmorally responsible for the crime—but, before God, nothing more! She\\nknew that she had committed a grave fault in not denouncing Conneau to\\nthe law, but she declared in a broken voice that that was a thing no\\nwoman could have done.\\u200a… She had loved him! Could she let her hand be\\nthe one to send him to the Guillotine? She had been guilty of much, but\\nshe was innocent of the terrible crime imputed to her.\\n\\nHowever that may have been, her eloquence and personality won the day.\\nMadame Beroldy, amidst a scene of unparalleled excitement, was\\nacquitted. Despite the utmost endeavours of the police, Georges Conneau\\nwas never traced. As for Madame Beroldy, nothing more was heard of her.\\nTaking the child with her, she left Paris to begin a new life.\\n\\n\\n\\n17 We Make Further Investigations\\n\\nI have set down the Beroldy case in full. Of course all the details did\\nnot present themselves to my memory as I have recounted them here.\\nNevertheless, I recalled the case fairly accurately. It had attracted a\\ngreat deal of interest at the time, and had been fully reported by the\\nEnglish papers, so that it did not need much effort of memory on my\\npart to recollect the salient details.\\n\\nJust for the moment, in my excitement, it seemed to clear up the whole\\nmatter. I admit that I am impulsive, and Poirot deplores my custom of\\njumping to conclusions, but I think I had some excuse in this instance.\\nThe remarkable way in which this discovery justified Poirot’s point of\\nview struck me at once.\\n\\n“Poirot,” I said, “I congratulate you. I see everything now.”\\n\\n“If that is indeed the truth, _I___ congratulate _you___, _mon ami___.\\nFor as a rule you are not famous for seeing—eh, is it not so?”\\n\\nI felt a little annoyed.\\n\\n“Come now, don’t rub it in. You’ve been so confoundedly mysterious all\\nalong with your hints and your insignificant details that any one might\\nfail to see what you were driving at.”\\n\\nPoirot lit one of his little cigarettes with his usual precision. Then\\nhe looked up.\\n\\n“And since you see everything now, _mon ami___, what exactly is it that\\nyou see?”\\n\\n“Why, that it was Madame Daubreuil—Beroldy, who murdered Mr. Renauld.\\nThe similarity of the two cases proves that beyond a doubt.”\\n\\n“Then you consider that Madame Beroldy was wrongly acquitted? That in\\nactual fact she was guilty of connivance in her husband’s murder?”\\n\\nI opened my eyes wide.\\n\\n“But of course! Don’t you?”\\n\\nPoirot walked to the end of the room, absentmindedly straightened a\\nchair, and then said thoughtfully.\\n\\n“Yes, that is my opinion. But there is no ‘of course’ about it, my\\nfriend. Technically speaking, Madame Beroldy is innocent.”\\n\\n“Of that crime, perhaps. But not of this.”\\n\\nPoirot sat down again, and regarded me, his thoughtful air more marked\\nthan ever.\\n\\n“So it is definitely your opinion, Hastings, that Madame Daubreuil\\nmurdered M. Renauld?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“Why?”\\n\\nHe shot the question at me with such suddenness that I was taken aback.\\n\\n“Why?” I stammered. “Why? Oh, because—” I came to a stop.\\n\\nPoirot nodded his head at me.\\n\\n“You see, you come to a stumbling-block at once. Why should Madame\\nDaubreuil (I shall call her that for clearness sake) murder M. Renauld?\\nWe can find no shadow of a motive. She does not benefit by his death;\\nconsidered as either mistress or blackmailer she stands to lose. You\\ncannot have a murder without a motive. The first crime was different,\\nthere we had a rich lover waiting to step into her husband’s shoes.”\\n\\n“Money is not the only motive for murder,” I objected.\\n\\n“True,” agreed Poirot placidly. “There are two others, the _crime\\npassionnel___ is one. And there is the third rare motive, murder for an\\nidea which implies some form of mental derangement on the part of the\\nmurderer. Homicidal mania, and religious fanaticism belong to that\\nclass. We can rule it out here.”\\n\\n“But what about the _crime passionnel?___ Can you rule that out? If\\nMadame Daubreuil was Renauld’s mistress, if she found that his\\naffection was cooling, or if her jealousy was aroused in any way, might\\nshe not have struck him down in a moment of anger?”\\n\\nPoirot shook his head.\\n\\n“If—I say _if___, you note—Madame Daubreuil was Renauld’s mistress, he\\nhad not had time to tire of her. And in any case you mistake her\\ncharacter. She is a woman who can simulate great emotional stress. She\\nis a magnificent actress. But, looked at dispassionately, her life\\ndisproves her appearance. Throughout, if we examine it, she had been\\ncold-blooded and calculating in her motives and actions. It was not to\\nlink her life with that of her young lover that she connived at her\\nhusband’s murder. The rich American, for whom she probably did not care\\na button, was her objective. If she committed a crime, she would always\\ndo so for gain. Here there was no gain. Besides, how do you account for\\nthe digging of the grave? That was a man’s work.”\\n\\n“She might have had an accomplice,” I suggested, unwilling to\\nrelinquish my belief.\\n\\n“I pass to another objection. You have spoken of the similarity between\\nthe two crimes. Wherein does that lie, my friend?”\\n\\nI stared at him in astonishment.\\n\\n“Why, Poirot, it was you who remarked on that! The story of the masked\\nmen, the ‘secret,’ the papers!”\\n\\nPoirot smiled a little.\\n\\n“Do not be so indignant, I beg of you. I repudiate nothing. The\\nsimilarity of the two stories links the two cases together inevitably.\\nBut reflect now on something very curious. It is not Madame Daubreuil\\nwho tells us this tale—if it were all would indeed be plain sailing—it\\nis Madame Renauld. Is she then in league with the other?”\\n\\n“I can’t believe that,” I said slowly. “If it is so, she must be the\\nmost consummate actress the world has ever known.”\\n\\n“Ta-ta-ta,” said Poirot impatiently. “Again you have the sentiment, and\\nnot the logic! If it is necessary for a criminal to be a consummate\\nactress, then by all means assume her to be one. But is it necessary? I\\ndo not believe Madame Renauld to be in league with Madame Daubreuil for\\nseveral reasons, some of which I have already enumerated to you. The\\nothers are self-evident. Therefore, that possibility eliminated, we\\ndraw very near to the truth which is, as always, very curious and\\ninteresting.”\\n\\n“Poirot,” I cried, “what more do you know?”\\n\\n“_Mon ami___, you must make your own deductions. You have ‘access to\\nthe facts!’ Concentrate your grey cells. Reason—not like Giraud—but\\nlike Hercule Poirot.”\\n\\n“But are you _sure?___”\\n\\n“My friend, in many ways I have been an imbecile. But at last I see\\nclearly.”\\n\\n“You know everything?”\\n\\n“I have discovered what M. Renauld sent for me to discover.”\\n\\n“And you know the murderer?”\\n\\n“I know one murderer.”\\n\\n“What do you mean?”\\n\\n“We talk a little at cross-purposes. There are here not one crime, but\\ntwo. The first I have solved, the second—_eh bien___, I will confess, I\\nam not sure!”\\n\\n“But, Poirot, I thought you said the man in the shed had died a natural\\ndeath?”\\n\\n“Ta-ta-ta.” Poirot made his favourite ejaculation of impatience. “Still\\nyou do not understand. One may have a crime without a murderer, but for\\ntwo crimes it is essential to have two bodies.”\\n\\nHis remark struck me as so peculiarly lacking in lucidity that I looked\\nat him in some anxiety. But he appeared perfectly normal. Suddenly he\\nrose and strolled to the window.\\n\\n“Here he is,” he observed.\\n\\n“Who?”\\n\\n“M. Jack Renauld. I sent a note up to the Villa to ask him to come\\nhere.”\\n\\nThat changed the course of my ideas, and I asked Poirot if he knew that\\nJack Renauld had been in Merlinville on the night of the crime. I had\\nhoped to catch my astute little friend napping, but as usual, he was\\nomniscient. He, too, had inquired at the station.\\n\\n“And without doubt we are not original in the idea, Hastings. The\\nexcellent Giraud, he also has probably made his inquiries.”\\n\\n“You don’t think—” I said, and then stopped. “Ah, no, it would be too\\nhorrible!”\\n\\nPoirot looked inquiringly at me, but I said no more. It had just\\noccurred to me that though there were seven women directly or\\nindirectly connected with the case Mrs. Renauld, Madame Daubreuil and\\nher daughter, the mysterious visitor, and the three servants—there was,\\nwith the exception of old Auguste who could hardly count, only one\\nman—Jack Renauld. _And a man must have dug a grave.\\u200a…___\\n\\nI had no time to develop further the appalling idea that had occurred\\nto me, for Jack Renauld was ushered into the room.\\n\\nPoirot greeted him in a business-like manner.\\n\\n“Take a seat, monsieur. I regret infinitely to derange you, but you\\nwill perhaps understand that the atmosphere of the Villa is not too\\ncongenial to me. M. Giraud and I do not see eye to eye about\\neverything. His politeness to me has not been striking and you will\\ncomprehend that I do not intend any little discoveries I may make to\\nbenefit him in any way.”\\n\\n“Exactly, M. Poirot,” said the lad. “That fellow Giraud is an\\nill-conditioned brute, and I’d be delighted to see some one score at\\nhis expense.”\\n\\n“Then I may ask a little favour of you?”\\n\\n“Certainly.”\\n\\n“I will ask you to go to the railway station and take a train to the\\nnext station along the line, Abbalac. Ask there at the cloak-room\\nwhether two foreigners deposited a valise there on the night of the\\nmurder. It is a small station, and they are almost certain to remember.\\nWill you do this?”\\n\\n“Of course I will,” said the boy, mystified, though ready for the task.\\n\\n“I and my friend, you comprehend, have business elsewhere,” explained\\nPoirot. “There is a train in a quarter of an hour, and I will ask you\\nnot to return to the Villa, as I have no wish for Giraud to get an\\ninkling of your errand.”\\n\\n“Very well, I will go straight to the station.”\\n\\nHe rose to his feet. Poirot’s voice stopped him.\\n\\n“One moment, M. Renauld, there is one little matter that puzzles me.\\nWhy did you not mention to M. Hautet this morning that you were in\\nMerlinville on the night of the crime?”\\n\\nJack Renauld’s face went crimson. With an effort he controlled himself.\\n\\n“You have made a mistake. I was in Cherbourg, as I told the examining\\nmagistrate this morning.”\\n\\nPoirot looked at him, his eyes narrowed, cat-like, until they only\\nshowed a gleam of green.\\n\\n“Then it is a singular mistake that I have made there—for it is shared\\nby the station staff. They say you arrived by the 11:40 train.”\\n\\nFor a moment Jack Renauld hesitated, then he made up his mind.\\n\\n“And if I did? I suppose you do not mean to accuse me of participating\\nin my father’s murder?” He asked the question haughtily, his head\\nthrown back.\\n\\n“I should like an explanation of the reason that brought you here.”\\n\\n“That is simple enough. I came to see my fiancée, Mademoiselle\\nDaubreuil. I was on the eve of a long voyage, uncertain as to when I\\nshould return. I wished to see her before I went, to assure her of my\\nunchanging devotion.”\\n\\n“And you did see her?” Poirot’s eyes never left the other’s face.\\n\\nThere was an appreciable pause before Renauld replied. Then he said:\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“And afterwards?”\\n\\n“I found I had missed the last train. I walked to St. Beauvais where I\\nknocked up a garage and got a car to take me back to Cherbourg.”\\n\\n“St. Beauvais? That is fifteen kilometres. A long walk, M. Renauld.”\\n\\n“I—I felt like walking.”\\n\\nPoirot bowed his head as a sign that he accepted the explanation. Jack\\nRenauld took up his hat and cane and departed. In a trice Poirot jumped\\nto his feet.\\n\\n“Quick, Hastings. We will go after him.”\\n\\nKeeping a discreet distance behind our quarry, we followed him through\\nthe streets of Merlinville. But when Poirot saw that he took the\\nturning to the station, he checked himself.\\n\\n“All is well. He has taken the bait. He will go to Abbalac, and will\\ninquire for the mythical valise left by the mythical foreigners. Yes,\\n_mon ami___, all that was a little invention of my own.”\\n\\n“You wanted him out of the way!” I exclaimed.\\n\\n“Your penetration is amazing, Hastings! Now, if you please, we will go\\nup to the Villa Geneviève.”\\n\\n\\n\\n18 Giraud Acts\\n\\n“By the way, Poirot,” I said, as we walked along the hot white road,\\n“I’ve got a bone to pick with you. I dare say you meant well, but\\nreally it was no business of yours to go mouching round to the Hôtel du\\nPhare without letting me know.”\\n\\nPoirot shot a quick sidelong glance at me.\\n\\n“And how did you know I had been there?” he inquired.\\n\\nMuch to my annoyance I felt the colour rising in my cheeks.\\n\\n“I happened to look in in passing,” I explained with as much dignity as\\nI could muster.\\n\\nI rather feared Poirot’s banter, but to my relief, and somewhat to my\\nsurprise, he only shook his head with a rather unusual gravity.\\n\\n“If I have offended your susceptibilities in any way, I demand pardon\\nof you. You will understand better soon. But, believe me, I have\\nstriven to concentrate all my energies on the case.”\\n\\n“Oh, it’s all right,” I said, mollified by the apology. “I know it’s\\nonly that you have my interests at heart. But I can take care of myself\\nall right.”\\n\\nPoirot seemed to be about to say something further, but checked\\nhimself.\\n\\nArrived at the Villa, Poirot led the way up to the shed where the\\nsecond body had been discovered. He did not, however, go in, but paused\\nby the bench which I have mentioned before as being set some few yards\\naway from it. After contemplating it for a moment or two, he paced\\ncarefully from it to the hedge which marked the boundary between the\\nVilla Geneviève and the Villa Marguerite. Then he paced back again,\\nnodding his head as he did so. Returning again to the hedge, he parted\\nthe bushes with his hands.\\n\\n“With good fortune,” he remarked to me over his shoulder, “Mademoiselle\\nMarthe may find herself in the garden. I desire to speak to her and\\nwould prefer not to call formally at the Villa Marguerite. Ah, all is\\nwell, there she is. Pst, mademoiselle! Pst! _Un moment, s’il vous\\nplaît.___”\\n\\nI joined him at the moment that Marthe Daubreuil, looking slightly\\nstartled, came running up to the hedge at his call.\\n\\n“A little word with you, mademoiselle, if it is permitted?”\\n\\n“Certainly, Monsieur Poirot.”\\n\\nDespite her acquiescence, her eyes looked troubled and afraid.\\n\\n“Mademoiselle, do you remember running after me on the road the day\\nthat I came to your house with the examining magistrate? You asked me\\nif any one were suspected of the crime.”\\n\\n“And you told me two Chilians.” Her voice sounded rather breathless,\\nand her left hand stole to her breast.\\n\\n“Will you ask me the same question again, mademoiselle?”\\n\\n“What do you mean?”\\n\\n“This. If you were to ask me that question again, I should give you a\\ndifferent answer. Some one is suspected—but not a Chilian.”\\n\\n“Who?” The word came faintly between her parted lips.\\n\\n“M. Jack Renauld.”\\n\\n“What?” It was a cry. “Jack? Impossible. Who dares to suspect him?”\\n\\n“Giraud.”\\n\\n“Giraud!” The girl’s face was ashy. “I am afraid of that man. He is\\ncruel. He will—he will—” She broke off. There was courage gathering in\\nher face, and determination. I realized in that moment that she was a\\nfighter. Poirot, too, watched her intently.\\n\\n“You know, of course, that he was here on the night of the murder?” he\\nasked.\\n\\n“Yes,” she replied mechanically. “He told me.”\\n\\n“It was unwise to have tried to conceal the fact,” ventured Poirot.\\n\\n“Yes, yes,” she replied impatiently. “But we cannot waste time on\\nregrets. We must find something to save him. He is innocent, of course,\\nbut that will not help him with a man like Giraud who has his\\nreputation to think of. He must arrest some one, and that some one will\\nbe Jack.”\\n\\n“The facts will tell against him,” said Poirot. “You realize that?”\\n\\nShe faced him squarely, and used the words I had heard her say in her\\nmother’s drawing-room.\\n\\n“I am not a child, monsieur. I can be brave and look facts in the face.\\nHe is innocent, and we must save him.”\\n\\nShe spoke with a kind of desperate energy, then was silent, frowning as\\nshe thought.\\n\\n“Mademoiselle,” said Poirot observing her keenly, “is there not\\nsomething that you are keeping back that you could tell us?”\\n\\nShe nodded perplexedly.\\n\\n“Yes, there is something, but I hardly know whether you will believe\\nit—it seems so absurd.”\\n\\n“At any rate, tell us, mademoiselle.”\\n\\n“It is this. M. Giraud sent for me, as an afterthought, to see if I\\ncould identify the man in there.” She signed with her head towards the\\nshed. “I could not. At least I could not at the moment. But since I\\nhave been thinking—”\\n\\n“Well?”\\n\\n“It seems so queer, and yet I am almost sure. I will tell you. On the\\nmorning of the day M. Renauld was murdered, I was walking in the garden\\nhere, when I heard a sound of men’s voices quarrelling. I pushed aside\\nthe bushes and looked through. One of the men was M. Renauld and the\\nother was a tramp, a dreadful looking creature in filthy rags. He was\\nalternately whining and threatening. I gathered he was asking for\\nmoney, but at that moment _maman___ called me from the house, and I had\\nto go. That is all, only—I am almost sure that the tramp and the dead\\nman in the shed are one and the same.”\\n\\nPoirot uttered an exclamation.\\n\\n“But why did you not say so at the time, mademoiselle?”\\n\\n“Because at first it only struck me that the face was vaguely familiar\\nin some way. The man was differently dressed, and apparently belonged\\nto a superior station in life. But tell me, Monsieur Poirot, is it not\\npossible that this tramp might have attacked and killed M. Renauld, and\\ntaken his clothes and money?”\\n\\n“It is an idea, mademoiselle,” said Poirot slowly. “It leaves a lot\\nunexplained, but it is certainly an idea. I will think of it.”\\n\\nA voice called from the house.\\n\\n“_Maman___,” whispered Marthe, “I must go.” And she slipped away\\nthrough the trees.\\n\\n“Come,” said Poirot, and taking my arm, turned in the direction of the\\nVilla.\\n\\n“What do you really think?” I asked, in some curiosity. “Was that story\\ntrue, or did the girl make it up in order to divert suspicion from her\\nlover?”\\n\\n“It is a curious tale,” said Poirot, “but I believe it to be the\\nabsolute truth. Unwittingly, Mademoiselle Marthe told us the truth on\\nanother point—and incidentally gave Jack Renauld the lie. Did you\\nnotice his hesitation when I asked him if he saw Marthe Daubreuil on\\nthe night of the crime? He paused and then said ‘Yes.’ I suspected that\\nhe was lying. It was necessary for me to see Mademoiselle Marthe before\\nhe could put her on her guard. Three little words gave me the\\ninformation I wanted. When I asked her if she knew that Jack Renauld\\nwas here that night, she answered ‘He _told___ me.’ Now, Hastings, what\\nwas Jack Renauld doing here on that eventful evening, and if he did not\\nsee Mademoiselle Marthe whom did he see?”\\n\\n“Surely, Poirot,” I cried, aghast, “you cannot believe that a boy like\\nthat would murder his own father.”\\n\\n“_Mon ami___,” said Poirot, “you continue to be of a sentimentality\\nunbelievable! I have seen mothers who murdered their little children\\nfor the sake of the insurance money! After that, one can believe\\nanything.”\\n\\n“And the motive?”\\n\\n“Money of course. Remember that Jack Renauld thought that he would come\\nin to half his father’s fortune at the latter’s death.”\\n\\n“But the tramp. Where does he come in?”\\n\\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n“Giraud would say that he was an accomplice—an apache who helped young\\nRenauld to commit the crime, and who was conveniently put out of the\\nway afterwards.”\\n\\n“But the hair round the dagger? The woman’s hair?”\\n\\n“Ah,” said Poirot, smiling broadly. “That is the cream of Giraud’s\\nlittle jest. According to him, it is not a woman’s hair at all.\\nRemember that the youths of today wear their hair brushed straight back\\nfrom the forehead with pomade or hairwash to make it lie flat.\\nConsequently some of the hairs are of considerable length.”\\n\\n“And you believe that too?”\\n\\n“No,” said Poirot with a curious smile. “For I know it to be the hair\\nof a woman—and more, which woman!”\\n\\n“Madame Daubreuil,” I announced positively.\\n\\n“Perhaps,” said Poirot, regarding me quizzically.\\n\\nBut I refused to allow myself to get annoyed.\\n\\n“What are we going to do now?” I asked, as we entered the hall of the\\nVilla Geneviève.\\n\\n“I wish to make a search amongst the effects of M. Jack Renauld. That\\nis why I had to get him out of the way for a few hours.”\\n\\n“But will not Giraud have searched already?” I asked doubtfully.\\n\\n“Of course. He builds a case, as a beaver builds a dam, with a\\nfatiguing industry. But he will not have looked for the things that I\\nam seeking—in all probability he would not have seen their importance\\nif they stared him in the face. Let us begin.”\\n\\nNeatly and methodically, Poirot opened each drawer in turn, examined\\nthe contents, and returned them exactly to their places. It was a\\nsingularly dull and uninteresting proceeding. Poirot waded on through\\ncollars, pajamas and socks. A purring noise outside drew me to the\\nwindow. Instantly I became galvanized into life.\\n\\n“Poirot!” I cried. “A car has just driven up. Giraud is in it, and Jack\\nRenauld, and two gendarmes.”\\n\\n“_Sacré tonnerre!___” growled Poirot. “That animal of a Giraud, could\\nhe not wait? I shall not be able to replace the things in this last\\ndrawer with the proper method. Let us be quick.”\\n\\nUnceremoniously he tumbled out the things on the floor, mostly ties and\\nhandkerchiefs. Suddenly with a cry of triumph Poirot pounced on\\nsomething, a small square cardboard, evidently a photograph. Thrusting\\nit into his pocket, he returned the things pell-mell to the drawer, and\\nseizing me by the arm dragged me out of the room and down the stairs.\\nIn the hall stood Giraud, contemplating his prisoner.\\n\\n“Good afternoon, M. Giraud,” said Poirot. “What have we here?”\\n\\nGiraud nodded his head towards Jack.\\n\\n“He was trying to make a getaway, but I was too sharp for him. He is\\nunder arrest for the murder of his father, M. Paul Renauld.”\\n\\nPoirot wheeled to confront the boy who leaned limply against the door,\\nhis face ashy pale.\\n\\n“What do you say to that, _jeune homme?___”\\n\\nJack Renauld stared at him stonily.\\n\\n“Nothing,” he said.\\n\\n\\n\\n19 I Use My Grey Cells\\n\\nI was dumbfounded. Up to the last, I had not been able bring myself to\\nbelieve Jack Renauld guilty. I had expected a ringing proclamation of\\nhis innocence when Poirot challenged him. But now, watching him as he\\nstood, white and limp against the wall, and hearing the damning\\nadmission fall from his lips, I doubted no longer.\\n\\nBut Poirot had turned to Giraud.\\n\\n“What are your grounds for arresting him?”\\n\\n“Do you expect me to give them to you?”\\n\\n“As a matter of courtesy, yes.”\\n\\nGiraud looked at him doubtfully. He was torn between a desire to refuse\\nrudely and the pleasure of triumphing over his adversary.\\n\\n“You think I have made a mistake, I suppose?” he sneered.\\n\\n“It would not surprise me,” replied Poirot, with a soupçon of malice.\\n\\nGiraud’s face took on a deeper tinge of red.\\n\\n“_Eh bien___, come in here. You shall judge for yourself.” He flung\\nopen the door of the _salon___, and we passed in, leaving Jack Renauld\\nin the care of the two other men.\\n\\n“Now, M. Poirot,” said Giraud laying his hat on the table, and speaking\\nwith the utmost sarcasm, “I will treat you to a little lecture on\\ndetective work. I will show you how we moderns work.”\\n\\n“_Bien!___” said Poirot, composing himself to listen. “I will show you\\nhow admirably the Old Guard can listen,” and he leaned back and closed\\nhis eyes, opening them for a moment to remark. “Do not fear that I\\nshall sleep. I will attend most carefully.”\\n\\n“Of course,” began Giraud, “I soon saw through all that Chilian\\ntomfoolery. Two men were in it—but they were not mysterious foreigners!\\nAll that was a blind.”\\n\\n“Very creditable so far, my dear Giraud,” murmured Poirot. “Especially\\nafter that clever trick of theirs with the match and cigarette end.”\\n\\nGiraud glared, but continued:\\n\\n“A man must have been connected with the case, in order to dig the\\ngrave. There is no man who actually benefits by the crime, but there\\nwas a man who thought he would benefit. I heard of Jack Renauld’s\\nquarrel with his father, and of the threats that he had used. The\\nmotive was established. Now as to means. Jack Renauld was in\\nMerlinville that night. He concealed the fact—which turned suspicion\\ninto certainty. Then we found a second victim—_stabbed with the same\\ndagger___. We know when that dagger was stolen. Captain Hastings here\\ncan fix the time. Jack Renauld, arriving from Cherbourg, was the only\\nperson who could have taken it. I have accounted for all the other\\nmembers of the household.”\\n\\nPoirot interrupted:\\n\\n“You are wrong. There is one other person who could have taken the\\ndagger.”\\n\\n“You refer to M. Stonor? He arrived at the front door, in an automobile\\nwhich had brought him straight from Calais. Ah, believe me, I have\\nlooked into everything. M. Jack Renauld arrived by train. An hour\\nelapsed between his arrival, and the moment he presented himself at the\\nhouse. Without doubt, he saw Captain Hastings and his companion leave\\nthe shed, slipped in himself and took the dagger, stabbed his\\naccomplice in the shed—”\\n\\n“Who was already dead!”\\n\\nGiraud shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n“Possibly he did not observe that. He may have judged him to be\\nsleeping. Without doubt they had a rendezvous. In any case he knew this\\napparent second murder would greatly complicate the case. It did.”\\n\\n“But it could not deceive M. Giraud,” murmured Poirot.\\n\\n“You mock yourself at me. But I will give you one last irrefutable\\nproof. Madame Renauld’s story was false—a fabrication from beginning to\\nend. We believe Madame Renauld to have loved her husband—_yet she lied\\nto shield his murderer___. For whom will a woman lie? Sometimes for\\nherself, usually for the man she loves, _always___ for her children.\\nThat is the last—the irrefutable proof. You cannot get round it.”\\n\\nGiraud paused, flushed and triumphant. Poirot regarded him steadily.\\n\\n“That is my case,” said Giraud. “What have you to say to it?”\\n\\n“Only that there is one thing you have failed to take into account.”\\n\\n“What is that?”\\n\\n“Jack Renauld was presumably acquainted with the planning out of the\\ngolf course. He knew that the body would be discovered almost at once,\\nwhen they started to dig the bunker.”\\n\\nGiraud laughed out loud.\\n\\n“But it is idiotic what you say there! He wanted the body to be found!\\nUntil it was found, he could not presume death, and would have been\\nunable to enter into his inheritance.”\\n\\nI saw a quick flash of green in Poirot’s eyes as he rose to his feet.\\n\\n“Then why bury it?” he asked softly. “Reflect, Giraud. Since it was to\\nJack Renauld’s advantage that the body should be found without delay,\\n_why dig a grave at all?___”\\n\\nGiraud did not reply. The question found him unprepared. He shrugged\\nhis shoulders as though to intimate that it was of no importance.\\n\\nPoirot moved towards the door. I followed him.\\n\\n“There is one more thing that you have failed to take into account,” he\\nsaid over his shoulder.\\n\\n“What is that?”\\n\\n“The piece of lead piping,” said Poirot, and left the room.\\n\\nJack Renauld still stood in the hall, with a white dumb face, but as we\\ncame out of the _salon___, he looked up sharply. At the same moment\\nthere was the sound of a footfall on the staircase. Mrs. Renauld was\\ndescending it. At the sight of her son, standing between the two\\nmyrmidons of the law, she stopped as though petrified.\\n\\n“Jack,” she faltered. “Jack, what is this?”\\n\\nHe looked up at her, his face set.\\n\\n“They have arrested me, mother.”\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\nShe uttered a piercing cry, and before any one could get to her swayed\\nand fell heavily. We both ran to her and lifted her up. In a minute\\nPoirot stood up again.\\n\\n“She has cut her head badly, on the corner of the stairs. I fancy there\\nis a slight concussion also. If Giraud wants a statement from her, he\\nwill have to wait. She will probably be unconscious for at least a\\nweek.”\\n\\nDenise and Françoise had run to their mistress, and leaving her in\\ntheir charge Poirot left the house. He walked with his head bent down,\\nfrowning thoughtfully at the ground. For some time I did not speak, but\\nat last I ventured to put a question to him.\\n\\n“Do you believe then, in spite of all appearances to the contrary, that\\nJack Renauld may not be guilty?”\\n\\nPoirot did not answer at once, but after a long wait he said gravely:\\n\\n“I do not know, Hastings. There is just a chance of it. Of course\\nGiraud is all wrong—wrong from beginning to end. If Jack Renauld is\\nguilty, it is in spite of Giraud’s arguments, not _because___ of them.\\nAnd the gravest indictment against him is known only to me.”\\n\\n“What is that?” I asked, impressed.\\n\\n“If you would use your grey cells, and see the whole case clearly as I\\ndo, you too would perceive it, my friend.”\\n\\nThis was what I called one of Poirot’s irritating answers. He went on,\\nwithout waiting for me to speak.\\n\\n“Let us walk this way to the sea. We will sit on that little mound\\nthere, overlooking the beach, and review the case. You shall know all\\nthat I know, but I would prefer that you should come at the truth by\\nyour own efforts—not by my leading you by the hand.”\\n\\nWe established ourselves on the grassy knoll as Poirot had suggested,\\nlooking out to sea. From farther along the sand, the cries of the\\nbathers reached us faintly. The sea was of the palest blue, and the\\nhalcyon calm reminded me of the day we had arrived at Merlinville, my\\nown good spirits, and Poirot’s suggestion that I was “fey.” What a long\\ntime seemed to have elapsed since then. And in reality it was only\\nthree days!\\n\\n“Think, my friend,” said Poirot’s voice encouragingly. “Arrange your\\nideas. Be methodical. Be orderly. There is the secret of success.”\\n\\nI endeavoured to obey him, casting my mind back over all the details of\\nthe case. And reluctantly it seemed to me that the only clear and\\npossible solution was that of Giraud—which Poirot despised. I reflected\\nanew. If there was daylight anywhere it was in the direction of Madame\\nDaubreuil. Giraud was ignorant of her connection with the Beroldy Case.\\nPoirot had declared the Beroldy Case to be all important. It was there\\nI must seek. I was on the right track now. And suddenly I started as an\\nidea of bewildering luminosity shot into my brain. Trembling I built up\\nmy hypothesis.\\n\\n“You have a little idea, I see, _mon ami!___ Capital. We progress.”\\n\\nI sat up, and lit a pipe.\\n\\n“Poirot,” I said, “it seems to me we have been strangely remiss. I say\\nwe—although I dare say _I___ would be nearer the mark. But you must pay\\nthe penalty of your determined secrecy. So I say again we have been\\nstrangely remiss. There is some one we have forgotten.”\\n\\n“And who is that?” inquired Poirot, with twinkling eyes.\\n\\n“Georges Conneau!”\\n\\n\\n\\n20 An Amazing Statement\\n\\nThe next moment Poirot embraced me warmly. “_Enfin!___ You have\\narrived. And all by yourself. It is superb! Continue your reasoning.\\nYou are right. Decidedly we have done wrong to forget Georges Conneau.”\\n\\nI was so flattered by the little man’s approval that I could hardly\\ncontinue. But at last I collected my thoughts and went on.\\n\\n“Georges Conneau disappeared twenty years ago, but we have no reason to\\nbelieve that he is dead.”\\n\\n“_Aucunement___,” agreed Poirot. “Proceed.”\\n\\n“Therefore we will assume that he is alive.”\\n\\n“Exactly.”\\n\\n“Or that he was alive until recently.”\\n\\n“_De mieux en mieux!___”\\n\\n“We will presume,” I continued, my enthusiasm rising, “that he has\\nfallen on evil days. He has become a criminal, an apache, a tramp—a\\nwhat you will. He chances to come to Merlinville. There he finds the\\nwoman he has never ceased to love.”\\n\\n“Eh eh! The sentimentality,” warned Poirot.\\n\\n“Where one hates one also loves,” I quoted or misquoted. “At any rate\\nhe finds her there, living under an assumed name. But she has a new\\nlover, the Englishman, Renauld. Georges Conneau, the memory of old\\nwrongs rising in him, quarrels with this Renauld. He lies in wait for\\nhim as he comes to visit his mistress, and stabs him in the back. Then,\\nterrified at what he has done, he starts to dig a grave. I imagine it\\nlikely that Madame Daubreuil comes out to look for her lover. She and\\nConneau have a terrible scene. He drags her into the shed, and there\\nsuddenly falls down in an epileptic fit. Now supposing Jack Renauld to\\nappear. Madame Daubreuil tells him all, points out to him the dreadful\\nconsequences to her daughter if this scandal of the past is revived.\\nHis father’s murderer is dead—let them do their best to hush it up.\\nJack Renauld consents—goes to the house and has an interview with his\\nmother, winning her over to his point of view. Primed with the story\\nthat Madame Daubreuil has suggested to him, she permits herself to be\\ngagged and bound. There, Poirot, what do you think of that?” I leaned\\nback, flushed with the pride of successful reconstruction.\\n\\nPoirot looked at me thoughtfully.\\n\\n“I think that you should write for the Kinema, _mon ami___,” he\\nremarked at last.\\n\\n“You mean—?”\\n\\n“It would make a good film, the story that you have recounted to me\\nthere—but it bears no sort of resemblance to everyday life.”\\n\\n“I admit that I haven’t gone into all the details, but—”\\n\\n“You have gone further—you have ignored them magnificently. What about\\nthe way the two men were dressed? Do you suggest that after stabbing\\nhis victim, Conneau removed his suit of clothes, donned it himself, and\\nreplaced the dagger?”\\n\\n“I don’t see that that matters,” I objected rather huffily. “He may\\nhave obtained clothes and money from Madame Daubreuil by threats\\nearlier in the day.”\\n\\n“By threats—eh? You seriously advance that supposition?”\\n\\n“Certainly. He could have threatened to reveal her identity to the\\nRenaulds, which would probably have put an end to all hopes of her\\ndaughter’s marriage.”\\n\\n“You are wrong, Hastings. He could not blackmail her, for she had the\\nwhip hand. Georges Conneau, remember, is still wanted for murder. A\\nword from her and he is in danger of the guillotine.”\\n\\nI was forced, rather reluctantly, to admit the truth of this.\\n\\n“_Your___ theory,” I remarked acidly, “is doubtless correct as to all\\nthe details?”\\n\\n“My theory is the truth,” said Poirot quietly. “And the truth is\\nnecessarily correct. In your theory you made a fundamental error. You\\npermitted your imagination to lead you astray with midnight\\nassignations and passionate love scenes. But in investigating crime we\\nmust take our stand upon the commonplace. Shall I demonstrate my\\nmethods to you?”\\n\\n“Oh, by all means let us have a demonstration!”\\n\\nPoirot sat very upright and began, wagging his forefinger emphatically\\nto emphasize his points.\\n\\n“I will start as you started from the basic fact of Georges Conneau.\\nNow the story told by Madame Beroldy in court as to the ‘Russians’ was\\nadmittedly a fabrication. If she was innocent of connivance in the\\ncrime, it was concocted by her, and by her only as she stated. If, on\\nthe other hand, she was not innocent, it might have been invented by\\neither her or Georges Conneau.\\n\\n“Now in this case we are investigating, we meet the same tale. As I\\npointed out to you, the facts render it very unlikely that Madame\\nDaubreuil inspired it. So we turn to the hypothesis that the story had\\nits origin in the brain of Georges Conneau. Very good. Georges Conneau,\\ntherefore, planned the crime with Madame Renauld as his accomplice. She\\nis in the limelight, and behind her is a shadowy figure whose alias is\\nunknown to us.\\n\\n“Now let us go carefully over the Renauld Case from the beginning,\\nsetting down each significant point in its chronological order. You\\nhave a notebook and pencil? Good. Now what is the earliest point to\\nnote down?”\\n\\n“The letter to you?”\\n\\n“That was the first we knew of it, but it is not the proper beginning\\nof the case. The first point of any significance, I should say, is the\\nchange that came over M. Renauld shortly after arriving in Merlinville,\\nand which is attested to by several witnesses. We have also to consider\\nhis friendship with Madame Daubreuil, and the large sums of money paid\\nover to her. From thence we can come directly to the 23rd May.”\\n\\nPoirot paused, cleared his throat, and signed to me to write.\\n\\n“_23rd May.___ M. Renauld quarrels with his son over latter’s wish to\\nmarry Marthe Daubreuil. Son leaves for Paris.\\n\\n“_24th May.___ M. Renauld alters his will, leaving entire control of\\nhis fortune in his wife’s hands.\\n\\n“_7th June.___ Quarrel with tramp in garden, witnessed by Marthe\\nDaubreuil.\\n\\n“Letter written to M. Hercule Poirot, imploring assistance.\\n\\n“Telegram sent to Jack Renauld, bidding him proceed by the _Anzora___\\nto Buenos Ayres.\\n\\n“Chauffeur, Masters, sent off on a holiday.\\n\\n“Visit of a lady, that evening. As he is seeing her out, his words are\\n‘Yes, yes—but for God’s sake go now.\\u200a…’\\u200a”\\n\\nPoirot paused.\\n\\n“There, Hastings, take each of those facts one by one, consider them\\ncarefully by themselves and in relation to the whole, and see if you do\\nnot get new light on the matter.”\\n\\nI endeavoured conscientiously to do as he had said. After a moment or\\ntwo, I said rather doubtfully:\\n\\n“As to the first points, the question seems to be whether we adopt the\\ntheory of blackmail, or of an infatuation for this woman.”\\n\\n“Blackmail, decidedly. You heard what Stonor said as to his character\\nand habits.”\\n\\n“Mrs. Renauld did not confirm his view,” I argued.\\n\\n“We have already seen that Madame Renauld’s testimony cannot be relied\\nupon in any way. We must trust to Stonor on that point.”\\n\\n“Still, if Renauld had an affair with a woman called Bella, there seems\\nno inherent improbability in his having another with Madame Daubreuil.”\\n\\n“None whatever, I grant you, Hastings. But did he?”\\n\\n“The letter, Poirot. You forget the letter.”\\n\\n“No, I do not forget. But what makes you think that letter was written\\nto M. Renauld?”\\n\\n“Why it was found in his pocket and—and—”\\n\\n“And that is all!” cut in Poirot. “There was no mention of any name to\\nshow to whom the letter was addressed. We assumed it was to the dead\\nman because it was in the pocket of his overcoat. Now, _mon ami___,\\nsomething about that overcoat struck me as unusual. I measured it, and\\nmade the remark that he wore his overcoat very long. That remark should\\nhave given you to think.”\\n\\n“I thought you were just saying it for the sake of saying something,” I\\nconfessed.\\n\\n“Ah, _quelle idée!___ Later you observed me measuring the overcoat of\\nM. Jack Renauld. _Eh bien___, M. Jack Renauld wears his overcoat very\\nshort. Put those two facts together with a third, namely that M. Jack\\nRenauld flung out of the house in a hurry on his departure for Paris,\\nand tell me what you make of it!”\\n\\n“I see,” I said slowly, as the meaning of Poirot’s remarks bore in upon\\nme. “That letter was written to Jack Renauld—not to his father. He\\ncaught up the wrong overcoat in his haste and agitation.”\\n\\nPoirot nodded.\\n\\n“_Précisement!___ We can return to this point later. For the moment let\\nus content ourselves with accepting the letter as having nothing to do\\nwith M. Renauld _père___, and pass to the next chronological event.”\\n\\n“May 23rd,” I read, “M. Renauld quarrels with his son over latter’s\\nwish to marry Marthe Daubreuil. Son leaves for Paris. I don’t see\\nanything much to remark upon there, and the altering of the will the\\nfollowing day seems straightforward enough. It was the direct result of\\nthe quarrel.”\\n\\n“We agree, _mon ami___—at least as to the cause. But what exact motive\\nunderlay this procedure of M. Renauld’s?”\\n\\nI opened my eyes in surprise.\\n\\n“Anger against his son of course.”\\n\\n“Yet he wrote him affectionate letters to Paris?”\\n\\n“So Jack Renauld says, but he cannot produce them.”\\n\\n“Well, let us pass from that.”\\n\\n“Now we come to the day of the tragedy. You have placed the events of\\nthe morning in a certain order. Have you any justification for that?”\\n\\n“I have ascertained that the letter to me was posted at the same time\\nas the telegram was despatched. Masters was informed he could take a\\nholiday shortly afterwards. In my opinion the quarrel with the tramp\\ntook place anterior to these happenings.”\\n\\n“I do not see that you can fix that definitely—unless you question\\nMademoiselle Dabreuil again.”\\n\\n“There is no need. I am sure of it. And if you do not see that, you see\\nnothing, Hastings!”\\n\\nI looked at him for a moment.\\n\\n“Of course! I am an idiot. If the tramp was Georges Conneau, it was\\nafter the stormy interview with him that Mr. Renauld apprehended\\ndanger. He sent away the chauffeur, Masters, whom he suspected of being\\nin the other’s pay, he wired to his son, and sent for you.”\\n\\nA faint smile crossed Poirot’s lips.\\n\\n“You do not think it strange that he should use exactly the same\\nexpressions in his letter as Madame Renauld used later in her story? If\\nthe mention of Santiago was a blind, why should Renauld speak of it,\\nand—what is more—send his son there?”\\n\\n“It is puzzling, I admit, but perhaps we shall find some explanation\\nlater. We come now to the evening, and the visit of the mysterious\\nlady. I confess that that fairly baffles me, unless it was Madame\\nDaubreuil, as Françoise all along maintained.”\\n\\nPoirot shook his head.\\n\\n“My friend, my friend, where are your wits wandering? Remember the\\nfragment of cheque, and the fact that the name Bella Duveen was faintly\\nfamiliar to Stonor, and I think we may take it for granted that Bella\\nDuveen is the full name of Jack’s unknown correspondent, and that it\\nwas she who came to the Villa Geneviève that night. Whether she\\nintended to see Jack, or whether she meant all along to appeal to his\\nfather we cannot be certain, but I think we may assume that this is\\nwhat occurred. She produced her claim upon Jack, probably showed\\nletters that he had written her, and the older man tried to buy her off\\nby writing a cheque. This she indignantly tore up. The terms of her\\nletter are those of a woman genuinely in love, and she would probably\\ndeeply resent being offered money. In the end he got rid of her, and\\nhere the words that he used are significant.”\\n\\n“\\u200a‘Yes, yes, but for God’s sake go now,’\\u200a” I repeated. “They seem to me\\na little vehement, perhaps, that is all.”\\n\\n“That is enough. He was desperately anxious for the girl to go. Why?\\nNot only because the interview was unpleasant. No, it was the time that\\nwas slipping by, and for some reason time was precious.”\\n\\n“Why should it be?” I asked, bewildered.\\n\\n“That is what we ask ourselves. Why should it be? But later we have the\\nincident of the wrist watch—which again shows us that time plays a very\\nimportant part in the crime. We are now fast approaching the actual\\ndrama. It is half-past ten when Bella Duveen leaves, and by the\\nevidence of the wrist watch we know that the crime was committed, or at\\nany rate that it was staged, before twelve o’clock. We have reviewed\\nall the events anterior to the murder, there remains only one unplaced.\\nBy the doctor’s evidence, the tramp, when found, had been dead at least\\nforty-eight hours—with a possible margin of twenty-four hours more.\\nNow, with no other facts to help me than those we have discussed, I\\nplace the death as having occurred on the morning of June 7th.”\\n\\nI stared at him, stupefied.\\n\\n“But how? Why? How can you possibly know?”\\n\\n“Because only in that way can the sequence of events be logically\\nexplained. _Mon ami___, I have taken you step by step along the way. Do\\nyou not now see what is so glaringly plain?”\\n\\n“My dear Poirot, I can’t see anything glaring about it. I did think I\\nwas beginning to see my way before, but I’m now hopelessly fogged.”\\n\\nPoirot looked at me sadly, and shook his head. “_Mon Dieu!___ But it is\\n_triste!___ A good intelligence—and so deplorably lacking in method.\\nThere is an exercise most excellent for the development of the little\\ngrey cells. I will impart it to you—”\\n\\n“For Heaven’s sake, not now! You really are the most irritating of\\nfellows, Poirot. For goodness’ sake, get on and tell me who killed M.\\nRenauld.”\\n\\n“That is just what I am not sure of as yet.”\\n\\n“But you said it was glaringly clear?”\\n\\n“We talk at cross-purposes, my friend. Remember, it is two crimes we\\nare investigating—for which, as I pointed out to you, we have the\\nnecessary two bodies. There, there, _ne vous impatientez pas!___ I\\nexplain all. To begin with, we apply our psychology. We find three\\npoints at which M. Renauld displays a distinct change of view and\\naction—three psychological points therefore. The first occurs\\nimmediately after arriving in Merlinville, the second after quarrelling\\nwith his son on a certain subject, the third on the morning of June\\n7th. Now for the three causes. We can attribute No. 1 to meeting Madame\\nDaubreuil. No. 2 is indirectly connected with her since it concerns a\\nmarriage between M. Renauld’s son and her daughter. But the cause of\\nNo. 3 is hidden from us. We have to deduce it. Now, _mon ami___, let me\\nask you a question; who do we believe to have planned this crime?”\\n\\n“Georges Conneau,” I said doubtfully, eyeing Poirot warily.\\n\\n“Exactly. Now Giraud laid it down as an axiom that a woman lies to save\\nherself, the man she loves, and her child. Since we are satisfied that\\nwas Georges Conneau who dictated the lie to her, and as Georges Conneau\\nis not Jack Renauld, follows that the third case is put out of court.\\nAnd, still attributing the crime to Georges Conneau, the first is\\nequally so. So we are forced to the second—that Madame Renauld lied for\\nthe sake of the man she loved—or in other words, for the sake of\\nGeorges Conneau. You agree to that.”\\n\\n“Yes,” I admitted. “It seems logical enough.”\\n\\n“_Bien!___ Madame Renauld loves Georges Conneau. Who, then, is Georges\\nConneau?”\\n\\n“The tramp.”\\n\\n“Have we any evidence to show that Madame Renauld loved the tramp?”\\n\\n“No, but—”\\n\\n“Very well then. Do not cling to theories where facts no longer support\\nthem. Ask yourself instead who Madame Renauld _did___ love.”\\n\\nI shook my head perplexed.\\n\\n“_Mais, oui___, you know perfectly. Who did Madame Renauld love so\\ndearly that when she saw his dead body, she fell down in a swoon?”\\n\\nI stared dumbfounded.\\n\\n“Her husband?” I gasped.\\n\\nPoirot nodded.\\n\\n“Her husband—or Georges Conneau, whichever you like to call him.”\\n\\nI rallied myself.\\n\\n“But it’s impossible.”\\n\\n“How ‘impossible?’ Did we not agree just now that Madame Daubreuil was\\nin a position to blackmail Georges Conneau?”\\n\\n“Yes, but—”\\n\\n“And did she not very effectively blackmail M. Renauld?”\\n\\n“That may be true enough, but—”\\n\\n“And is it not a fact that we know nothing of M. Renauld’s youth and\\nupbringing? That he springs suddenly into existence as a French\\nCanadian exactly twenty-two years ago?”\\n\\n“All that is so,” I said more firmly, “but you seem to me to be\\noverlooking one salient point.”\\n\\n“What is it, my friend?”\\n\\n“Why, we have admitted Georges Conneau planned the crime. That brings\\nus to the ridiculous statement that he planned his own murder!”\\n\\n“_Eh bien, mon ami___,” said Poirot placidly, “that is just what he did\\ndo!”\\n\\n\\n\\n21 Hercule Poirot on the Case!\\n\\nIn a measured voice, Poirot began his exposition.\\n\\n“It seems strange to you, _mon ami___, that a man should plan his own\\ndeath? So strange, that you prefer to reject the truth as fantastic,\\nand to revert to a story that is in reality ten times more impossible.\\nYes, M. Renauld planned his own death, but there is one detail that\\nperhaps escapes you—he did not intend to die.”\\n\\nI shook my head, bewildered.\\n\\n“But no, it is all most simple really,” said Poirot kindly. “For the\\ncrime that M. Renauld proposed a murderer was not necessary, as I told\\nyou, but a body was. Let us reconstruct, seeing events this time from a\\ndifferent angle.\\n\\n“Georges Conneau flies from justice—to Canada. There, under an assumed\\nname he marries, and finally acquires a vast fortune in South America.\\nBut there is a nostalgia upon him for his own country. Twenty years\\nhave elapsed, he is considerably changed in appearance, besides being a\\nman of such eminence that no one is likely to connect him with a\\nfugitive from justice many years ago. He deems it quite safe to return.\\nHe takes up his headquarters in England, but intends to spend the\\nsummers in France. And ill fortune, that obscure justice which shapes\\nmen’s ends, and will not allow them to evade the consequences of their\\nacts, takes him to Merlinville. There, in the whole of France, is the\\none person who is capable of recognizing him. It is, of course, a gold\\nmine to Madame Daubreuil, and a gold mine of which she is not slow to\\ntake advantage. He is helpless, absolutely in her power. And she bleeds\\nhim heavily.\\n\\n“And then the inevitable happens. Jack Renauld falls in love with the\\nbeautiful girl he sees almost daily, and wishes to marry her. That\\nrouses his father. At all costs, he will prevent his son marrying the\\ndaughter of this evil woman. Jack Renauld knows nothing of his father’s\\npast, but Madame Renauld knows everything. She is a woman of great\\nforce of character, and passionately devoted to her husband. They take\\ncounsel together. Renauld sees only one way of escape—death. He must\\nappear to die, in reality escaping to another country where he will\\nstart again under an assumed name, and where Madame Renauld, having\\nplayed the widow’s part for a while, can join him. It is essential that\\nshe should have control of the money, so he alters his will. How they\\nmeant to manage the body business originally, I do not know—possibly an\\nart student’s skeleton—and a fire or something of the kind, but long\\nbefore their plans have matured an event occurs which plays into their\\nhands. A rough tramp, violent and abusive, finds his way into the\\ngarden. There is a struggle, M. Renauld seeks to eject him, and\\nsuddenly the tramp, an epileptic, falls down in a fit. He is dead. M.\\nRenauld calls his wife. Together they drag him into the shed—as we\\nknow, the event had occurred just outside—and they realize the\\nmarvellous opportunity that has been vouchsafed them. The man bears no\\nresemblance to M. Renauld, but he is middle-aged, of a usual French\\ntype. That is sufficient.\\n\\n“I rather fancy that they sat on the bench up there, out of earshot\\nfrom the house, discussing matters. Their plan was quickly made. The\\nidentification must rest solely on Madame Renauld’s evidence. Jack\\nRenauld and the chauffeur (who had been with his master two years) must\\nbe got out of the way. It was unlikely that the French women servants\\nwould go near the body, and in any case Renauld intended to take\\nmeasures to deceive any one not likely to appreciate details. Masters\\nwas sent off, a telegram despatched to Jack, Buenos Ayres being\\nselected to give credence to the story that Renauld had decided upon.\\nHaving heard of me, as a rather obscure elderly detective, he wrote his\\nappeal for help knowing that, when I arrived, the production of the\\nletter would have a profound effect upon the examining\\nmagistrate—which, of course, it did.\\n\\n“They dressed the body of the tramp in a suit of M. Renauld’s and left\\nhis ragged coat and trousers by the door of the shed, not daring to\\ntake them into the house. And then, to give credence to the tale Madame\\nRenauld was to tell, they drove the aeroplane dagger through his heart.\\nThat night, M. Renauld will first bind and gag his wife, and then,\\ntaking a spade, will dig a grave in that particular spot of ground\\nwhere he knows a—how do you call it? bunkair?—is to be made. It is\\nessential that the body should be found—Madame Daubreuil must have no\\nsuspicions. On the other hand, if a little time elapses, any dangers as\\nto identity will be greatly lessened. Then, M. Renauld will don the\\ntramp’s rags, and shuffle off to the station, where he will leave,\\nunnoticed, by the 12:10 train. Since the crime will be supposed to have\\ntaken place two hours later, no suspicion can possibly attach to him.\\n\\n“You see now his annoyance at the inopportune visit of the girl Bella.\\nEvery moment of delay is fatal to his plans. He gets rid of her as soon\\nas he can, however. Then, to work! He leaves the front door slightly\\najar to create the impression that the assassins left that way. He\\nbinds and gags Madame Renauld, correcting his mistake of twenty-two\\nyears ago, when the looseness of the bonds caused suspicion to fall\\nupon his accomplice, but leaving her primed with essentially the same\\nstory as he had invented before, proving the unconscious recoil of the\\nmind against originality. The night is chilly, and he slips on an\\novercoat over his underclothing, intending to cast it into the grave\\nwith the dead man. He goes out by the window, smoothing over the flower\\nbed carefully, and thereby furnishing the most positive evidence\\nagainst himself. He goes out on to the lonely golf links, and he\\ndigs—and then—”\\n\\n“Yes?”\\n\\n“And then,” said Poirot gravely, “the justice that he has so long\\neluded overtakes him. An unknown hand stabs him in the back.\\u200a… Now,\\nHastings, you understand what I mean when I talk of _two___ crimes. The\\nfirst crime, the crime that M. Renauld, in his arrogance, asked us to\\ninvestigate (ah, but he made a famous mistake there! He misjudged\\nHercule Poirot!) is solved. But behind it lies a deeper riddle. And to\\nsolve that will be difficult—since the criminal in his wisdom, has been\\ncontent to avail himself of the devices prepared by M. Renauld. It has\\nbeen a particularly perplexing and baffling mystery to solve. A young\\nhand, like Giraud, who does not place any reliance on the psychology,\\nis almost certain to fail.”\\n\\n“You’re marvellous, Poirot,” I said, with admiration. “Absolutely\\nmarvellous. No one on earth but you could have done it!”\\n\\nI think my praise pleased him. For once in his life, he looked almost\\nembarrassed.\\n\\n“Ah, then you no longer despise poor old Papa Poirot? You shift your\\nallegiance back from the human foxhound?”\\n\\nHis term for Giraud never failed to make me smile.\\n\\n“Rather. You’ve scored over him handsomely.”\\n\\n“That poor Giraud,” said Poirot, trying unsuccessfully to look modest.\\n“Without doubt it is not all stupidity. He has had _la mauvaise\\nchance___ once or twice. That dark hair coiled round the dagger, for\\ninstance. To say the least, it was misleading.”\\n\\n“To tell you the truth, Poirot,” I said slowly, “even now I don’t quite\\nsee—whose hair was it?”\\n\\n“Madame Renauld’s of course. That is where _la mauvaise chance___ came\\nin. Her hair, dark originally, is almost completely silvered. It might\\njust as easily have been a grey hair—and then, by no conceivable effort\\ncould Giraud have persuaded himself it came from the head of Jack\\nRenauld! But it is all of a piece. Always the facts must be twisted to\\nfit the theory! Did not Giraud find the traces of two persons, a man\\nand a woman, in the shed? And how does that fit in with his\\nreconstruction of the case? I will tell you—it does not fit in, and so\\nwe shall hear no more of them! I ask you, is that a methodical way of\\nworking? The great Giraud! The great Giraud is nothing but a toy\\nballoon—swollen with its own importance. But I, Hercule Poirot, whom he\\ndespises, will be the little pin that pricks the big balloon—_comme\\nça!___” And he made an expressive gesture. Then, calming down, he\\nresumed:\\n\\n“Without doubt, when Madame Renauld recovers, she will speak. The\\npossibility of her son being accused of the murder never occurred to\\nher. How should it, when she believed him safely at sea on board the\\n_Anzora?___ _Ah! voilà une femme___, Hastings! What force, what\\nself-command! She only made one slip. On his unexpected return: ‘It\\ndoes not matter—_now___.’ And no one noticed—no one realized the\\nsignificance of those words. What a terrible part she has had to play,\\npoor woman. Imagine the shock when she goes to identify the body and,\\ninstead of what she expects, sees the actual lifeless form of the\\nhusband she has believed miles away by now. No wonder she fainted! But\\nsince then, despite her grief and her despair, how resolutely she has\\nplayed her part, and how the anguish of it must wring her. She cannot\\nsay a word to set us on the track of the real murderers. For her son’s\\nsake, no one must know that Paul Renauld was Georges Conneau, the\\ncriminal. Final and most bitter blow, she has admitted publicly that\\nMadame Daubreuil was her husband’s mistress—for a hint of blackmail\\nmight be fatal to her secret. How cleverly she dealt with the examining\\nmagistrate when he asked her if there was any mystery in her husband’s\\npast life. ‘Nothing so romantic, I am sure, M. le juge.’ It was\\nperfect, the indulgent tone, the _soupçon___ of sad mockery. At once M.\\nHautet felt himself foolish and melodramatic. Yes, she is a great\\nwoman! If she loved a criminal, she loved him royally!”\\n\\nPoirot lost himself in contemplation.\\n\\n“One thing more, Poirot, what about the piece of lead piping?”\\n\\n“You do not see? To disfigure the victim’s face so that it would be\\nunrecognizable. It was that which first set me on the right track. And\\nthat imbecile of a Giraud, swarming all over it to look for match ends!\\nDid I not tell you that a clue of two feet long was quite as good as a\\nclue of two inches?”\\n\\n“Well, Giraud will sing small now,” I observed hastily, to lead the\\nconversation away from my own shortcomings.\\n\\n“As I said before, will he? If he has arrived at the right person by\\nthe wrong method, he will not permit that to worry him.”\\n\\n“But surely—” I paused as I saw the new trend of things.\\n\\n“You see, Hastings, we must now start again. Who killed M. Renauld?\\nSome one who was near the Villa just before twelve o’clock that night,\\nsome one who would benefit by his death—the description fits Jack\\nRenauld only too well. The crime need not have been premeditated. And\\nthen the dagger!”\\n\\nI started, I had not realized that point.\\n\\n“Of course,” I said. “The second dagger we found in the tramp was Mrs.\\nRenauld’s. There _were___ two, then.”\\n\\n“Certainly, and, since they were duplicates, it stands to reason that\\nJack Renauld was the owner. But that would not trouble me so much. In\\nfact I have a little idea as to that. No, the worst indictment against\\nhim is again psychological—heredity, _mon ami___, heredity! Like\\nfather, like son—Jack Renauld, when all is said or done, is the son of\\nGeorges Conneau.”\\n\\nHis tone was grave and earnest, and I was impressed in spite of myself.\\n\\n“What is your little idea that you mentioned just now?” I asked.\\n\\nFor answer, Poirot consulted his turnip-faced watch, and then asked:\\n\\n“What time is the afternoon boat from Calais?”\\n\\n“About five, I believe.”\\n\\n“That will do very well. We shall just have time.”\\n\\n“You are going to England?”\\n\\n“Yes, my friend.”\\n\\n“Why?”\\n\\n“To find a possible—witness.”\\n\\n“Who?”\\n\\nWith a rather peculiar smile upon his face, Poirot replied:\\n\\n“Miss Bella Duveen.”\\n\\n“But how will you find her—what do you know about her?”\\n\\n“I know nothing about her—but I can guess a good deal. We may take it\\nfor granted that her name _is___ Bella Duveen, and since that name was\\nfaintly familiar to M. Stonor, though evidently not in connection with\\nthe Renauld family, it is probable that she is on the stage. Jack\\nRenauld was a young man with plenty of money, and twenty years of age.\\nThe stage is sure to have been the home of his first love. It tallies,\\ntoo, with M. Renauld’s attempt to placate her with a cheque. I think I\\nshall find her all right—especially with the help of _this___.”\\n\\nAnd he brought out the photograph I had seen him take from Jack\\nRenauld’s drawer. “With love from Bella,” was scrawled across the\\ncorner, but it was not that which held my eyes fascinated. The likeness\\nwas not first rate—but for all that it was unmistakable to me. I felt a\\ncold sinking, as though some unutterable calamity had befallen me.\\n\\nIt was the face of Cinderella.\\n\\n\\n\\n22 I Find Love\\n\\nFor a moment or two I sat as though frozen, the photograph still in my\\nhand. Then, summoning all my courage to appear unmoved, I handed it\\nback. At the same time, I stole a quick glance at Poirot. Had he\\nnoticed anything? But to my relief he did not seem to be observing me.\\nAnything unusual in my manner had certainly escaped him.\\n\\nHe rose briskly to his feet.\\n\\n“We have no time to lose. We must make our departure with all despatch.\\nAll is well—the sea it will be calm!”\\n\\nIn the bustle of departure, I had no time for thinking, but once on\\nboard the boat, secure from Poirot’s observation (he, as usual, was\\n“practising the method most excellent of Laverguier”) I pulled myself\\ntogether, and attacked the facts dispassionately. How much did Poirot\\nknow? Was he aware that my acquaintance of the train and Bella Duveen\\nwere one and the same? Why had he gone to the Hôtel du Phare? On my\\nbehalf as I had believed? Or had I only fatuously thought so, and was\\nthis visit undertaken with a deeper and more sinister purpose?\\n\\nBut in any case, why was he bent on finding this girl? Did he suspect\\nher of having seen Jack Renauld commit the crime? Or did he suspect—but\\nthat was impossible! The girl had no grudge against the elder Renauld,\\nno possible motive for wishing his death. What had brought her back to\\nthe scene of the murder? I went over the facts carefully. She must have\\nleft the train at Calais where I parted from her that day. No wonder I\\nhad been unable to find her on the boat. If she had dined in Calais,\\nand then taken a train out to Merlinville, she would have arrived at\\nthe Villa Geneviève just about the time that Françoise said. What had\\nshe done when she left the house just after ten? Presumably either gone\\nto an hotel, or returned to Calais. And then? The crime had been\\ncommitted on Tuesday night. On Thursday morning, she was once more in\\nMerlinville. Had she ever left France at all? I doubted it very much.\\nWhat kept her there—the hope of seeing Jack Renauld? I had told her (as\\nat the time we believed) that he was on the high seas _en route___ to\\nBuenos Ayres. Possibly she was aware that the _Anzora___ had not\\nsailed. But to know that she must have seen Jack. Was that what Poirot\\nwas after? Had Jack Renauld, returning to see Marthe Daubreuil, come\\nface to face instead with Bella Duveen, the girl he had heartlessly\\nthrown over?\\n\\nI began to see daylight. If that were indeed the case, it might furnish\\nJack with the alibi he needed. Yet under those circumstances his\\nsilence seemed difficult to explain. Why could he not have spoken out\\nboldly? Did he fear for this former entanglement of his to come to the\\nears of Marthe Daubreuil? I shook my head, dissatisfied. The thing had\\nbeen harmless enough, a foolish boy and girl affair, and I reflected\\ncynically that the son of a millionaire was not likely to be thrown\\nover by a penniless French girl, who moreover loved him devotedly,\\nwithout a much graver cause.\\n\\nAltogether I found the affair puzzling and unsatisfactory. I disliked\\nintensely being associated with Poirot in hunting this girl down, but I\\ncould not see any way of avoiding it, without revealing everything to\\nhim, and this, for some reason, I was loath to do.\\n\\nPoirot reappeared brisk and smiling at Dover, and our journey to London\\nwas uneventful. It was past nine o’clock when we arrived, and I\\nsupposed that we should return straight away to our rooms and do\\nnothing till the morning. But Poirot had other plans.\\n\\n“We must lose no time, _mon ami___. The news of the arrest will not be\\nin the English papers until the day after tomorrow, but still we must\\nlose no time.”\\n\\nI did not quite follow his reasoning, but I merely asked how he\\nproposed to find the girl.\\n\\n“You remember Joseph Aarons, the theatrical agent? No? I assisted him\\nin a little matter of a Japanese wrestler. A pretty little problem, I\\nmust recount it to you one day. He, without doubt, will be able to put\\nus in the way of finding out what we want to know.”\\n\\nIt took us some time to run Mr. Aarons to earth, and it was after\\nmidnight when we finally managed it. He greeted Poirot with every\\nevidence of warmth, and professed himself ready to be of service to us\\nin any way.\\n\\n“There’s not much about the profession I don’t know,” he said, beaming\\ngenially.\\n\\n“_Eh bien___, M. Aarons, I desire to find a young girl called Bella\\nDuveen.”\\n\\n“Bella Duveen. I know the name, but for the moment I can’t place it.\\nWhat’s her line?”\\n\\n“That I do not know—but here is her photograph.”\\n\\nMr. Aarons studied it for a moment, then his face lighted.\\n\\n“Got it!” He slapped his thigh. “The Dulcibella Kids, by the Lord!”\\n\\n“The Dulcibella Kids?”\\n\\n“That’s it. They’re sisters. Acrobats, dancers and singers. Give quite\\na good little turn. They’re in the provinces somewhere, I believe—if\\nthey’re not resting. They’ve been on in Paris for the last two or three\\nweeks.”\\n\\n“Can you find out for me exactly where they are?”\\n\\n“Easy as a bird. You go home, and I’ll send you round the dope in the\\nmorning.”\\n\\nWith this promise we took leave of him. He was as good as his word.\\nAbout eleven o’clock the following day, a scribbled note reached us.\\n\\n“The Dulcibella Sisters are on at the Palace in Coventry. Good luck to\\nyou.”\\n\\nWithout more ado, we started for Coventry. Poirot made no inquiries at\\nthe theatre, but contented himself with booking stalls for the variety\\nperformance that evening.\\n\\nThe show was wearisome beyond words—or perhaps it was only my mood that\\nmade it seem so. Japanese families balanced themselves precariously,\\nwould-be fashionable men, in greenish evening dress and exquisitely\\nslicked hair, reeled off society patter and danced marvellously, stout\\nprima donnas sang at the top of the human register, a comic comedian\\nendeavoured to be Mr. George Robey and failed signally.\\n\\nAt last the number went up which announced the Dulcibella Kids. My\\nheart beat sickeningly. There she was—there they both were, the pair of\\nthem, one flaxen haired, one dark, matching as to size, with short\\nfluffy skirts and immense buster brown bows. They looked a pair of\\nextremely piquant children. They began to sing. Their voices were fresh\\nand true, rather thin and music-hally, but attractive.\\n\\nIt was quite a pretty little turn. They danced neatly, and did some\\nclever little acrobatic feats. The words of their songs were crisp and\\ncatchy. When the curtain fell, there was a full meed of applause.\\nEvidently the Dulcibella Kids were a success.\\n\\nSuddenly I felt that I could remain no longer. I must get out into the\\nair. I suggested leaving to Poirot.\\n\\n“Go by all means, _mon ami___. I amuse myself, and will stay to the\\nend. I will rejoin you later.”\\n\\nIt was only a few steps from the theatre to the hotel. I went up to the\\nsitting-room, ordered a whisky and soda, and sat drinking it, staring\\nmeditatively into the empty grate. I heard the door open, and turned my\\nhead, thinking it was Poirot. Then I jumped to my feet. It was\\nCinderella who stood in the doorway. She spoke haltingly, her breath\\ncoming in little gasps.\\n\\n“I saw you in front. You and your friend. When you got up to go, I was\\nwaiting outside and followed you. Why are you here—in Coventry? What\\nwere you doing there to-night? Is the man who was with you the—the\\ndetective?”\\n\\nShe stood there, the cloak she had wrapped round her stage dress\\nslipping from her shoulders. I saw the whiteness of her cheeks under\\nthe rouge, and heard the terror in her voice. And in that moment I\\nunderstood everything—understood why Poirot was seeking her, and what\\nshe feared, and understood at last my own heart.\\u200a…\\n\\n“Yes,” I said gently.\\n\\n“Is he looking for—me?” she half whispered.\\n\\nThen, as I did not answer for a moment, she slipped down by the big\\nchair, and burst into violent, bitter weeping.\\n\\nI knelt down by her, holding her in my arms, and smoothing the hair\\nback from her face.\\n\\n“Don’t cry, child, don’t cry, for God’s sake. You’re safe here. I’ll\\ntake care of you. Don’t cry, darling. Don’t cry. I know—I know\\neverything.”\\n\\n“Oh, but you don’t!”\\n\\n“I think I do.” And after a moment, as her sobs grew quieter, I asked:\\n“It was you who took the dagger, wasn’t it?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“That was why you wanted me to show you round? And why you pretended to\\nfaint?”\\n\\nAgain she nodded. It was a strange thought to come to me at the moment,\\nbut it shot into my mind that I was glad her motive was what it had\\nbeen—rather than the idle and morbid curiosity I had accused her of at\\nthe time. How gallantly she had played her part that day, inwardly\\nracked with fear and trepidation as she must have been. Poor little\\nsoul, bearing the burden of a moment’s impetuous action.\\n\\n“Why did you take the dagger?” I asked presently.\\n\\nShe replied as simply as a child:\\n\\n“I was afraid there might be finger-marks on it.”\\n\\n“But didn’t you remember that you had worn gloves?”\\n\\nShe shook her head as though bewildered, and then said slowly:\\n\\n“Are you going to give me up to—to the Police?”\\n\\n“Good God! no.”\\n\\nHer eyes sought mine long and earnestly, and then she asked in a little\\nquiet voice that sounded afraid of itself:\\n\\n“Why not?”\\n\\nIt seemed a strange place and a strange time for a declaration of\\nlove—and God knows, in all my imagining, I had never pictured love\\ncoming to me in such a guise. But I answered simply and naturally\\nenough:\\n\\n“Because I love you, Cinderella.”\\n\\nShe bent her head down, as though ashamed, and muttered in a broken\\nvoice:\\n\\n“You can’t—you can’t—not if you knew—” And then, as though rallying\\nherself, she faced me squarely, and asked:\\n\\n“What do you know, then?”\\n\\n“I know that you came to see Mr. Renauld that night. He offered you a\\ncheque and you tore it up indignantly. Then you left the house—” I\\npaused.\\n\\n“Go on—what next?”\\n\\n“I don’t know whether you knew that Jack Renauld would be coming that\\nnight, or whether you just waited about on the chance of seeing him,\\nbut you did wait about. Perhaps you were just miserable, and walked\\naimlessly—but at any rate just before twelve you were still near there,\\nand you saw a man on the golf links—”\\n\\nAgain I paused. I had leapt to the truth in a flash as she entered the\\nroom, but now the picture rose before me even more convincingly. I saw\\nvividly the peculiar pattern of the overcoat on the dead body of Mr.\\nRenauld, and I remembered the amazing likeness that had startled me\\ninto believing for one instant that the dead man had risen from the\\ndead when his son burst into our conclave in the _salon___.\\n\\n“Go on,” repeated the girl steadily.\\n\\n“I fancy his back was to you—but you recognized him, or thought you\\nrecognized him. The gait and the carriage were familiar to you, and the\\npattern of his overcoat.” I paused. “You told me in the train on the\\nway from Paris that you had Italian blood in your veins, and that you\\nhad nearly got into trouble once with it. You used a threat in one of\\nyour letters to Jack Renauld. When you saw him there, your anger and\\njealousy drove you mad—and you struck! I don’t believe for a minute\\nthat you meant to kill him. But you did kill him, Cinderella.”\\n\\nShe had flung up her hands to cover her face, and in a choked voice she\\nsaid:\\n\\n“You’re right\\u200a… you’re right\\u200a… I can see it all as you tell it.” Then\\nshe turned on me almost savagely. “And you love me? Knowing what you\\ndo, how can you love me?”\\n\\n“I don’t know,” I said a little wearily. “I think love is like that—a\\nthing one cannot help. I have tried, I know—ever since the first day I\\nmet you. And love has been too strong for me.”\\n\\nAnd then suddenly, when I least expected it, she broke down again,\\ncasting herself down on the floor and sobbing wildly.\\n\\n“Oh, I can’t!” she cried. “I don’t know what to do. I don’t know which\\nway to turn. Oh, pity me, pity me, some one, and tell me what to do!”\\n\\nAgain I knelt by her, soothing her as best I could.\\n\\n“Don’t be afraid of me, Bella. For God’s sake don’t be afraid of me. I\\nlove you, that’s true—but I don’t want anything in return. Only let me\\nhelp you. Love him still if you have to, but let me help you as he\\ncan’t.”\\n\\nIt was as though she had been turned to stone by my words. She raised\\nher head from her hands and stared at me.\\n\\n“You think that?” she whispered. “You think that I love Jack Renauld?”\\n\\nThen, half laughing, half crying, she flung her arms passionately round\\nmy neck, and pressed her sweet wet face to mine.\\n\\n“Not as I love you,” she whispered. “Never as I love you!”\\n\\nHer lips brushed my cheek, and then, seeking my mouth, kissed me again\\nand again with a sweetness and fire beyond belief. The wildness of\\nit—and the wonder, I shall not forget—no, not as long as I live!\\n\\nIt was a sound in the doorway that made us look up. Poirot was standing\\nthere looking at us.\\n\\nI did not hesitate. With a bound I reached him and pinioned his arms to\\nhis sides.\\n\\n“Quick,” I said to the girl. “Get out of here. As fast as you can. I’ll\\nhold him.”\\n\\nWith one look at me, she fled out of the room past us. I held Poirot in\\na grip of iron.\\n\\n“_Mon ami___,” observed the latter mildly, “you do this sort of thing\\nvery well. The strong man holds me in his grasp and I am helpless as a\\nchild. But all this is uncomfortable and slightly ridiculous. Let us\\nsit down and be calm.”\\n\\n“You won’t pursue her?”\\n\\n“_Mon Dieu!___ no. Am I Giraud? Release me, my friend.”\\n\\nKeeping a suspicious eye upon him, for I paid Poirot the compliment of\\nknowing that I was no match for him in astuteness, I relaxed my grip,\\nand he sank into an arm-chair, feeling his arms tenderly.\\n\\n“It is that you have the strength of a bull when you are roused,\\nHastings! _Eh bien___, and do you think you have behaved well to your\\nold friend? I show you the girl’s photograph and you recognize it, but\\nyou never say a word.”\\n\\n“There was no need if you knew that I recognized it,” I said rather\\nbitterly. So Poirot had known all along! I had not deceived him for an\\ninstant.\\n\\n“Ta-ta! You did not know that I knew that. And tonight you help the\\ngirl to escape when we have found her with so much trouble! _Eh\\nbien!___ it comes to this—are you going to work with me or against me,\\nHastings?”\\n\\nFor a moment or two I did not answer. To break with my old friend gave\\nme great pain. Yet I must definitely range myself against him. Would he\\never forgive me, I wondered? He had been strangely calm so far, but I\\nknew him to possess marvellous self-command.\\n\\n“Poirot,” I said, “I’m sorry. I admit I’ve behaved badly to you over\\nthis. But sometimes one has no choice. And in future I must take my own\\nline.”\\n\\nPoirot nodded his head several times.\\n\\n“I understand,” he said. The mocking light had quite died out of his\\neyes, and he spoke with a sincerity and kindness that surprised me. “It\\nis that, my friend, is it not? It is love that has come—not as you\\nimagined it, all cock a hoop with fine feathers, but sadly, with\\nbleeding feet. Well, well—I warned you. When I realized that this girl\\nmust have taken the dagger, I warned you. Perhaps you remember. But\\nalready it was too late. But, tell me, how much do you know?”\\n\\nI met his eyes squarely.\\n\\n“Nothing that you could tell me would be any surprise to me, Poirot.\\nUnderstand that. But in case you think of resuming your search for Miss\\nDuveen, I should like you to know one thing clearly. If you have any\\nidea that she was concerned in the crime, or was the mysterious lady\\nwho called upon Mr. Renauld that night, you are wrong. I travelled home\\nfrom France with her that day, and parted from her at Victoria that\\nevening so that it is clearly impossible for her to have been in\\nMerlinville.”\\n\\n“Ah!” Poirot looked at me thoughtfully. “And you would swear to that in\\na court of law?”\\n\\n“Most certainly I would.”\\n\\nPoirot rose and bowed.\\n\\n“_Mon ami! Vive l’amour!___ It can perform miracles. It is decidedly\\ningenious what you have thought of there. It defeats even Hercule\\nPoirot!”\\n\\n\\n\\n23 Difficulties Ahead\\n\\nAfter a moment of stress, such as I have just described, reaction is\\nbound to set in. I retired to rest that night on a note of triumph, but\\nI awoke to realize that I was by no means out of the wood. True, I\\ncould see no flaw in the alibi I had so suddenly conceived. I had but\\nto stick to my story, and I failed to see how Bella could be convicted\\nin face of it. It was not as though there was any old friendship\\nbetween us that could be raked up, and which might lead them to suspect\\nthat I was committing perjury. It could be proved that in actual fact I\\nhad only seen the girl on three occasions. No, I was still satisfied\\nwith my idea—had not even Poirot admitted that it defeated him?\\n\\nBut there I felt the need of treading warily. All very well for my\\nlittle friend to admit himself momentarily nonplussed. I had far too\\nmuch respect for his abilities to conceive of him as being content to\\nremain in that position. I had a very humble opinion of my wits when it\\ncame to matching them against his. Poirot would not take defeat lying\\ndown. Somehow or other, he would endeavour to turn the tables on me,\\nand that in the way, and at the moment, when I least expected it.\\n\\nWe met at breakfast the following morning as though nothing had\\nhappened. Poirot’s good temper was imperturbable, yet I thought I\\ndetected a film of reserve in his manner which was new. After\\nbreakfast, I announced my intention of going out for a stroll. A\\nmalicious gleam shot through Poirot’s eyes.\\n\\n“If it is information you seek, you need not be at the pains of\\nderanging yourself. I can tell you all you wish to know. The Dulcibella\\nSisters have cancelled their contract, and have left Coventry for an\\nunknown destination.”\\n\\n“Is that really so, Poirot?”\\n\\n“You can take it from me, Hastings. I made inquiries the first thing\\nthis morning. After all, what else did you expect?”\\n\\nTrue enough, nothing else could be expected under the circumstances.\\nCinderella had profited by the slight start I had been able to assure\\nher, and would certainly not lose a moment in removing herself from the\\nreach of the pursuer. It was what I had intended and planned.\\nNevertheless, I was aware of being plunged into a network of fresh\\ndifficulties.\\n\\nI had absolutely no means of communicating with the girl, and it was\\nvital that she should know the line of defence that had occurred to me,\\nand which I was prepared to carry out. Of course it was possible that\\nshe might try to send word to me in some way or another, but I hardly\\nthought it likely. She would know the risk she ran of a message being\\nintercepted by Poirot, thus setting him on her track once more. Clearly\\nher only course was to disappear utterly for the time being.\\n\\nBut, in the meantime, what was Poirot doing? I studied him attentively.\\nHe was wearing his most innocent air, and staring meditatively into the\\nfar distance. He looked altogether too placid and supine to give me\\nreassurance. I had learned, with Poirot, that the less dangerous he\\nlooked, the more dangerous he was. His quiescence alarmed me. Observing\\na troubled quality in my glance, he smiled benignantly.\\n\\n“You are puzzled, Hastings? You ask yourself why I do not launch myself\\nin pursuit?”\\n\\n“Well—something of the kind.”\\n\\n“It is what you would do, were you in my place. I understand that. But\\nI am not of those who enjoy rushing up and down a country seeking a\\nneedle in a haystack, as you English say. No—let Mademoiselle Bella\\nDuveen go. Without doubt, I shall be able to find her when the time\\ncomes. Until then, I am content to wait.”\\n\\nI stared at him doubtfully. Was he seeking to mislead me? I had an\\nirritating feeling that, even now, he was master of the situation. My\\nsense of superiority was gradually waning. I had contrived the girl’s\\nescape, and evolved a brilliant scheme for saving her from the\\nconsequences of her rash act—but I could not rest easy in my mind.\\nPoirot’s perfect calm awakened a thousand apprehensions.\\n\\n“I suppose, Poirot,” I said rather diffidently, “I mustn’t ask what\\nyour plans are? I’ve forfeited the right.”\\n\\n“But not at all. There is no secret about them. We return to France\\nwithout delay.”\\n\\n“_We?___”\\n\\n“Precisely—‘_we!___’ You know very well that you cannot afford to let\\nPapa Poirot out of your sight. Eh, is it not so, my friend? But remain\\nin England by all means if you wish—”\\n\\nI shook my head. He had hit the nail on the head. I could not afford to\\nlet him out of my sight. Although I could not expect his confidence\\nafter what had happened, I could still check his actions. The only\\ndanger to Bella lay with him. Giraud and the French police were\\nindifferent to her existence. At all costs I must keep near Poirot.\\n\\nPoirot observed me attentively as these reflections passed through my\\nmind, and gave a nod of satisfaction.\\n\\n“I am right, am I not? And as you are quite capable of trying to follow\\nme, disguised with some absurdity such as a false beard—which every one\\nwould perceive, _bien entendu___—I much prefer that we should voyage\\ntogether. It would annoy me greatly that any one should mock themselves\\nat you.”\\n\\n“Very well, then. But it’s only fair to warn you—”\\n\\n“I know—I know all. You are my enemy! Be my enemy then. It does not\\nworry me at all.”\\n\\n“So long as it’s all fair and above-board, I don’t mind.”\\n\\n“You have to the full the English passion for ‘fair-play!’ Now your\\nscruples are satisfied, let us depart immediately. There is no time to\\nbe lost. Our stay in England has been short but sufficient. I know—what\\nI wanted to know.”\\n\\nThe tone was light, but I read a veiled menace into the words.\\n\\n“Still—” I began, and stopped.\\n\\n“Still—as you say! Without doubt you are satisfied with the part you\\nare playing. Me, I preoccupy myself with Jack Renauld.”\\n\\nJack Renauld! The words gave me a start. I had completely forgotten\\nthat aspect of the case. Jack Renauld, in prison, with the shadow of\\nthe guillotine looming over him! I saw the part I was playing in a more\\nsinister light. I could save Bella—yes, but in doing so I ran the risk\\nof sending an innocent man to his death.\\n\\nI pushed the thought from me with horror. It could not be. He would be\\nacquitted. Certainly he would be acquitted! But the cold fear came\\nback. Suppose he were not? What then? Could I have it on my\\nconscience—horrible thought! Would it come to that in the end? A\\ndecision. Bella or Jack Renauld? The promptings of my heart were to\\nsave the girl I loved at any cost to myself. But, if the cost were to\\nanother, the problem was altered.\\n\\nWhat would the girl herself say? I remembered that no word of Jack\\nRenauld’s arrest had passed my lips. As yet she was in total ignorance\\nof the fact that her former lover was in prison charged with a hideous\\ncrime which he had not committed. When she knew, how would she act?\\nWould she permit her life to be saved at the expense of his? Certainly\\nshe must do nothing rash. Jack Renauld might, and probably would, be\\nacquitted without any intervention on her part. If so, good. But if he\\nwas not.\\u200a… That was the terrible, the unanswerable problem. I fancied\\nthat she ran no risk of the extreme penalty. The circumstances of the\\ncrime were quite different in her case. She could plead jealousy and\\nextreme provocation, and her youth and beauty would go for much. The\\nfact that by a tragic mistake it was old Mr. Renauld, and not his son,\\nwho paid the penalty would not alter the motive of the crime. But in\\nany case, however lenient the sentence of the Court, it must mean a\\nlong term of imprisonment.\\n\\nNo, Bella must be protected. And, at the same time, Jack Renauld must\\nbe saved. How this was to be accomplished I did not see clearly. But I\\npinned my faith to Poirot. He knew. Come what might, he would manage to\\nsave an innocent man. He must find some pretext other than the real\\none. It might be difficult, but he would manage it somehow. And with\\nBella unsuspected, and Jack Renauld acquitted, all would end\\nsatisfactorily.\\n\\nSo I told myself repeatedly, but at the bottom of my heart there still\\nremained a cold fear.\\n\\n\\n\\n24 “Save Him!”\\n\\nWe crossed from England by the evening boat, and the following morning\\nsaw us in Saint-Omer, whither Jack Renauld had been taken. Poirot lost\\nno time in visiting M. Hautet. As he did not seem disposed to make any\\nobjections to my accompanying him, I bore him company.\\n\\nAfter various formalities and preliminaries, we were conducted to the\\nexamining magistrate’s room. He greeted us cordially.\\n\\n“I was told that you had returned to England, M. Poirot. I am glad to\\nfind that such is not the case.”\\n\\n“It is true that I went there, M. le juge, but it was only for a flying\\nvisit. A side issue, but one that I fancied might repay investigation.”\\n\\n“And it did—eh?”\\n\\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders. M. Hautet nodded, sighing.\\n\\n“We must resign ourselves, I fear. That animal Giraud, his manners are\\nabominable, but he is undoubtedly clever! Not much chance of that one\\nmaking a mistake.”\\n\\n“You think not, M. le juge?”\\n\\nIt was the examining magistrate’s turn to shrug his shoulders.\\n\\n“_Eh bien___, speaking frankly—in confidence, _c’est entendu___—can you\\ncome to any other conclusion?”\\n\\n“Frankly, M. le juge, there seem to me to be many points that are\\nobscure.”\\n\\n“Such as—?”\\n\\nBut Poirot was not to be drawn.\\n\\n“I have not yet tabulated them,” he remarked. “It was a general\\nreflection that I was making. I liked the young man, and should be\\nsorry to believe him guilty of such a hideous crime. By the way, what\\nhas he to say for himself on the matter?”\\n\\nThe magistrate frowned.\\n\\n“I cannot understand him. He seems incapable of putting up any sort of\\ndefence. It has been most difficult to get him to answer questions. He\\ncontents himself with a general denial, and beyond that takes refuge in\\na most obstinate silence. I am interrogating him again tomorrow;\\nperhaps you would like to be present?”\\n\\nWe accepted the invitation with _empressement___.\\n\\n“A distressing case,” said the magistrate with a sigh. “My sympathy for\\nMadame Renauld is profound.”\\n\\n“How is Madame Renauld?”\\n\\n“She has not yet recovered consciousness. It is merciful in a way, poor\\nwoman, she is being spared much. The doctors say that there is no\\ndanger, but that when she comes to herself she must be kept as quiet as\\npossible. It was, I understand, quite as much the shock as the fall\\nwhich caused her present state. It would be terrible if her brain\\nbecame unhinged; but I should not wonder at all—no, really, not at\\nall.”\\n\\nM. Hautet leaned back, shaking his head, with a sort of mournful\\nenjoyment, as he envisaged the gloomy prospect.\\n\\nHe roused himself at length, and observed with a start.\\n\\n“That reminds me. I have here a letter for you, M. Poirot. Let me see,\\nwhere did I put it?”\\n\\nHe proceeded to rummage amongst his papers. At last he found the\\nmissive, and handed it to Poirot.\\n\\n“It was sent under cover to me in order that I might forward it to\\nyou,” he explained. “But as you left no address I could not do so.”\\n\\nPoirot studied the letter curiously. It was addressed in a long,\\nsloping, foreign hand, and the writing was decidedly a woman’s. Poirot\\ndid not open it. Instead he put it in his pocket and rose to his feet.\\n\\n“_A demain___ then, M. le juge. Many thanks for your courtesy and\\namiability.”\\n\\n“But not at all. I am always at your service. These young detectives of\\nthe school of Giraud, they are all alike—rude, sneering fellows. They\\ndo not realize that an examining magistrate of my—er—experience is\\nbound to have a certain discernment, a certain—_flair___. _Enfin!___\\nthe politeness of the old school is infinitely more to my taste.\\nTherefore, my dear friend, command me in any way you will. We know a\\nthing or two, you and I—eh?”\\n\\nAnd laughing heartily, enchanted with himself and with us, M. Hautet\\nbade us adieu. I am sorry to have to record that Poirot’s first remark\\nto me as we traversed the corridor was:\\n\\n“A famous old imbecile, that one! Of a stupidity to make pity!”\\n\\nWe were just leaving the building when we came face to face with\\nGiraud, looking more dandified than ever, and thoroughly pleased with\\nhimself.\\n\\n“Aha! M. Poirot,” he cried airily. “You have returned from England\\nthen?”\\n\\n“As you see,” said Poirot.\\n\\n“The end of the case is not far off now, I fancy.”\\n\\n“I agree with you, M. Giraud.”\\n\\nPoirot spoke in a subdued tone. His crest-fallen manner seemed to\\ndelight the other.\\n\\n“Of all the milk and water criminals! Not an idea of defending himself.\\nIt is extraordinary!”\\n\\n“So extraordinary that it gives one to think, does it not?” suggested\\nPoirot mildly.\\n\\nBut Giraud was not even listening. He twirled his cane amicably.\\n\\n“Well, good day, M. Poirot. I am glad you’re satisfied of young\\nRenauld’s guilt at last.”\\n\\n“_Pardon!___ But I am not in the least satisfied. Jack Renauld is\\ninnocent.”\\n\\nGiraud stared for a moment—then burst out laughing, tapping his head\\nsignificantly with the brief remark: “_Toqué!___”\\n\\nPoirot drew himself up. A dangerous light showed in his eyes.\\n\\n“M. Giraud, throughout the case your manner to me has been deliberately\\ninsulting! You need teaching a lesson. I am prepared to wager you 500\\nfrancs that I find the murderer of M. Renauld before you do. Is it\\nagreed?”\\n\\nGiraud stared helplessly at him, and murmured again:\\n\\n“_Toqué!___”\\n\\n“Come now,” urged Poirot, “is it agreed?”\\n\\n“I have no wish to take your money from you.”\\n\\n“Make your mind easy—you will not!”\\n\\n“Oh, well then, I agree! You speak of my manner to you being insulting.\\n_Eh bien___, once or twice, _your___ manner has annoyed _me___.”\\n\\n“I am enchanted to hear it,” said Poirot. “Good morning, M. Giraud.\\nCome, Hastings.”\\n\\nI said no word as we walked along the street. My heart was heavy.\\nPoirot had displayed his intentions only too plainly. I doubted more\\nthan ever my powers of saving Bella from the consequences of her act.\\nThis unlucky encounter with Giraud had roused Poirot and put him on his\\nmettle.\\n\\nSuddenly I felt a hand laid on my shoulder, and turned to face Gabriel\\nStonor. We stopped and greeted him, and he proposed strolling with us\\nback to our hotel.\\n\\n“And what are you doing here, M. Stonor?” inquired Poirot.\\n\\n“One must stand by one’s friends,” replied the other dryly. “Especially\\nwhen they are unjustly accused.”\\n\\n“Then you do not believe that Jack Renauld committed the crime?” I\\nasked eagerly.\\n\\n“Certainly I don’t. I know the lad. I admit that there have been one or\\ntwo things in this business that have staggered me completely, but none\\nthe less, in spite of his fool way of taking it, I’ll never believe\\nthat Jack Renauld is a murderer.”\\n\\nMy heart warmed to the secretary. His words seemed to lift a secret\\nweight from my heart.\\n\\n“I have no doubt that many people feel as you do,” I exclaimed. “There\\nis really absurdly little evidence against him. I should say that there\\nwas no doubt of his acquittal—no doubt whatever.”\\n\\nBut Stonor hardly responded as I could have wished.\\n\\n“I’d give a lot to think as you do,” he said gravely. He turned to\\nPoirot. “What’s your opinion, monsieur?”\\n\\n“I think that things look very black against him,” said Poirot quietly.\\n\\n“You believe him guilty?” said Stonor sharply.\\n\\n“No. But I think he will find it hard to prove his innocence.”\\n\\n“He’s behaving so damned queerly,” muttered Stonor. “Of course I\\nrealize that there’s a lot more in this affair than meets the eye.\\nGiraud’s not wise to that because he’s an outsider, but the whole thing\\nhas been damned odd. As to that, least said soonest mended. If Mrs.\\nRenauld wants to hush anything up, I’ll take my cue from her. It’s her\\nshow, and I’ve too much respect for her judgment to shove my oar in,\\nbut I can’t get behind this attitude of Jack’s. Any one would think he\\n_wanted___ to be thought guilty.”\\n\\n“But it’s absurd,” I cried, bursting in. “For one thing, the dagger—” I\\npaused, uncertain as to how much Poirot would wish me to reveal. I\\ncontinued, choosing my words carefully, “We know that the dagger could\\nnot have been in Jack Renauld’s possession that evening. Mrs. Renauld\\nknows that.”\\n\\n“True,” said Stonor. “When she recovers, she will doubtless say all\\nthis and more. Well, I must be leaving you.”\\n\\n“One moment.” Poirot’s hand arrested his departure. “Can you arrange\\nfor word to be sent to me at once should Madame Renauld recover\\nconsciousness?”\\n\\n“Certainly. That’s easily done.”\\n\\n“That point about the dagger is good, Poirot,” I urged as we went\\nupstairs. “I couldn’t speak very plainly before Stonor.”\\n\\n“That was quite right of you. We might as well keep the knowledge to\\nourselves as long as we can. As to the dagger, your point hardly helps\\nJack Renauld. You remember that I was absent for an hour this morning,\\nbefore we started from London?”\\n\\n“Yes?”\\n\\n“Well, I was employed in trying to find the firm Jack Renauld employed\\nto convert his souvenirs. It was not very difficult. _Eh bien___,\\nHastings, they made to his order not _two___ paper-knives, but\\n_three___.”\\n\\n“So that—?”\\n\\n“So that, after giving one to his mother, and one to Bella Duveen,\\nthere was a third which he doubtless retained for his own use. No,\\nHastings, I fear the dagger question will not help us to save him from\\nthe guillotine.”\\n\\n“It won’t come to that,” I cried, stung.\\n\\nPoirot shook his head uncertainly.\\n\\n“You will save him,” I cried positively.\\n\\nPoirot glanced at me dryly.\\n\\n“Have you not rendered it impossible, _mon ami?___”\\n\\n“Some other way,” I muttered.\\n\\n“Ah! _Sapristi!___ But it is miracles you ask from me. No—say no more.\\nLet us instead see what is in this letter.”\\n\\nAnd he drew out the envelope from his breast pocket.\\n\\nHis face contracted as he read, then he handed the one flimsy sheet to\\nme.\\n\\n“There are other women in the world who suffer, Hastings.”\\n\\nThe writing was blurred and the note had evidently been written in\\ngreat agitation:\\n\\n“_Dear M. Poirot:___\\n“If you get this, I beg of you to come to my aid. I have no one to turn\\nto, and at all costs Jack must be saved. I implore of you on my knees\\nto help us.\\n\\n\\n“MARTHE DAUBREUIL.”\\n\\n\\nI handed it back, moved.\\n\\n“You will go?”\\n\\n“At once. We will command an auto.”\\n\\nHalf an hour later saw us at the Villa Marguerite. Marthe was at the\\ndoor to meet us, and led Poirot in, clinging with both hands to one of\\nhis.\\n\\n“Ah, you have come—it is good of you. I have been in despair, not\\nknowing what to do. They will not let me go to see him in prison even.\\nI suffer horribly, I am nearly mad. Is it true what they say, that he\\ndoes not deny the crime? But that is madness. It is impossible that he\\nshould have done it! Never for one minute will I believe it.”\\n\\n“Neither do I believe it, mademoiselle,” said Poirot gently.\\n\\n“But then why does he not speak? I do not understand.”\\n\\n“Perhaps because he is screening some one,” suggested Poirot, watching\\nher.\\n\\nMarthe frowned.\\n\\n“Screening some one? Do you mean his mother? Ah, from the beginning I\\nhave suspected her. Who inherits all that vast fortune? She does. It is\\neasy to wear widow’s weeds and play the hypocrite. And they say that\\nwhen he was arrested she fell down—like _that___.” She made a dramatic\\ngesture. “And without doubt, M. Stonor, the secretary, he helped her.\\nThey are thick as thieves, those two. It is true she is older than\\nhe—but what do men care—if a woman is rich!”\\n\\nThere was a hint of bitterness in her tone.\\n\\n“Stonor was in England,” I put in.\\n\\n“He says so—but who knows?”\\n\\n“Mademoiselle,” said Poirot quietly, “if we are to work together, you\\nand I, we must have things clear. First, I will ask you a question.”\\n\\n“Yes, monsieur?”\\n\\n“Are you aware of your mother’s real name?”\\n\\nMarthe looked at him for a minute, then, letting her head fall forward\\non her arms, she burst into tears.\\n\\n“There, there,” said Poirot, patting her on the shoulder. “Calm\\nyourself, _petite___, I see that you know. Now a second question, did\\nyou know who M. Renauld was?”\\n\\n“M. Renauld,” she raised her head from her hands and gazed at him\\nwonderingly.\\n\\n“Ah, I see you do not know that. Now listen to me carefully.”\\n\\nStep by step, he went over the case, much as he had done to me on the\\nday of our departure for England. Marthe listened spellbound. When he\\nhad finished, she drew a long breath.\\n\\n“But you are wonderful—magnificent! You are the greatest detective in\\nthe world.”\\n\\nWith a swift gesture she slipped off her chair and knelt before him\\nwith an abandonment that was wholly French.\\n\\n“Save him, monsieur,” she cried. “I love him so. Oh, save him, save\\nhim—save him!”\\n\\n\\n\\n25 An Unexpected Dénouement\\n\\nWe were present the following morning at the examination of Jack\\nRenauld. Short as the time had been, I was shocked at the change that\\nhad taken place in the young prisoner. His cheeks had fallen in, there\\nwere deep black circles round his eyes, and he looked haggard and\\ndistraught, as one who had wooed sleep in vain for several nights. He\\nbetrayed no emotion at seeing us.\\n\\nThe prisoner and his counsel, Maître Grosíer, were accommodated with\\nchairs. A formidable guard with resplendent sabre stood before the\\ndoor. The patient _greffier___ sat at his desk. The examination began.\\n\\n“Renauld,” began the magistrate, “do you deny that you were in\\nMerlinville on the night of the crime?”\\n\\nJack did not reply at once, then he said with a hesitancy of manner\\nwhich was piteous:\\n\\n“I—I—told you that I was in Cherbourg.”\\n\\nMaître Grosíer frowned and sighed. I realized at once that Jack Renauld\\nwas obstinately bent on conducting his own case as he wished, to the\\ndespair of his legal representative.\\n\\nThe magistrate turned sharply.\\n\\n“Send in the station witnesses.”\\n\\nIn a moment or two the door opened to admit a man whom I recognized as\\nbeing a porter at Merlinville station.\\n\\n“You were on duty on the night of June 7th?”\\n\\n“Yes, monsieur.”\\n\\n“You witnessed the arrival of the 11:40 train?”\\n\\n“Yes, monsieur.”\\n\\n“Look at the prisoner. Do you recognize him as having been one of the\\npassengers to alight?”\\n\\n“Yes, Monsieur le juge.”\\n\\n“There is no possibility of your being mistaken?”\\n\\n“No, monsieur. I knew M. Jack Renauld well.”\\n\\n“Nor of your being mistaken as to the date?”\\n\\n“No, monsieur. Because it was the following morning, June 8th, that we\\nheard of the murder.”\\n\\nAnother railway official was brought in, and confirmed the first one’s\\nevidence. The magistrate looked at Jack Renauld.\\n\\n“These men have identified you positively. What have you to say?”\\n\\nJack shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n“Nothing.”\\n\\nM. Hautet exchanged a glance with the _greffier___, as the scratching\\nof the latter’s pen recorded the answer.\\n\\n“Renauld,” continued the magistrate, “do you recognize this?”\\n\\nHe took something from the table by his side, and held it out to the\\nprisoner. I shuddered as I recognized the aeroplane dagger.\\n\\n“Pardon,” cried Maître Grosíer. “I demand to speak to my client before\\nhe answers that question.”\\n\\nBut Jack Renauld had no consideration for the feelings of the wretched\\nGrosíer. He waved him aside, and replied quietly:\\n\\n“Certainly I recognize it. It is a present given by me to my mother, as\\na souvenir of the War.”\\n\\n“Is there, as far as you know, any duplicate of that dagger in\\nexistence?”\\n\\nAgain Maître Grosíer burst out, and again Jack overrode him.\\n\\n“Not that I know of. The setting was my own design.”\\n\\nEven the magistrate almost gasped at the boldness of the reply. It did,\\nin very truth, seem as though Jack was rushing on his fate. I realized,\\nof course, the vital necessity he was under of concealing, for Bella’s\\nsake, the fact that there was a duplicate dagger in the case. So long\\nas there was supposed to be only one weapon, no suspicion was likely to\\nattach to the girl who had had the second paper-knife in her\\npossession. He was valiantly shielding the woman he had once loved—but\\nat what a cost to himself! I began to realize the magnitude of the task\\nI had so lightly set Poirot. It would not be easy to secure the\\nacquittal of Jack Renauld, by anything short of the truth.\\n\\nM. Hautet spoke again, with a peculiarly biting inflection:\\n\\n“Madame Renauld told us that this dagger was on her dressing table on\\nthe night of the crime. But Madame Renauld is a mother! It will\\ndoubtless astonish you, Renauld, but I consider it highly likely that\\nMadame Renauld was mistaken, and that, by inadvertence perhaps, you had\\ntaken it with you to Paris. Doubtless you will contradict me—”\\n\\nI saw the lad’s handcuffed hands clench themselves. The perspiration\\nstood out in beads upon his brow, as with a supreme effort he\\ninterrupted M. Hautet in a hoarse voice:\\n\\n“I shall not contradict you. It is possible.”\\n\\nIt was a stupefying moment. Maître Grosíer rose to his feet,\\nprotesting:\\n\\n“My client has undergone a considerable nervous strain. I should wish\\nit put on record that I do not consider him answerable for what he\\nsays.”\\n\\nThe magistrate quelled him angrily. For a moment a doubt seemed to\\narise in his own mind. Jack Renauld had almost overdone his part. He\\nleaned forward, and gazed at the prisoner searchingly.\\n\\n“Do you fully understand, Renauld, that on the answers you have given\\nme I shall have no alternative but to commit you for trial?”\\n\\nJack’s pale face flushed. He looked steadily back.\\n\\n“M. Hautet, I swear that I did not kill my father.”\\n\\nBut the magistrate’s brief moment of doubt was over. He laughed a\\nshort, unpleasant laugh.\\n\\n“Without doubt, without doubt—they are always innocent, our prisoners!\\nBy your own mouth you are condemned. You can offer no defence, no\\nalibi—only a mere assertion which would not deceive a babe!—that you\\nare not guilty. You killed your father, Renauld—cruel and cowardly\\nmurder—for the sake of money which you believed would come to you at\\nhis death. Your mother was an accessory after the fact. Doubtless, in\\nview of the fact that she acted as a mother, the courts will extend an\\nindulgence to her that they will not accord to you. And rightly so!\\nYour crime was a horrible one—to be held in abhorrence by gods and\\nmen!” M. Hautet was enjoying himself, working up his period, steeped in\\nthe solemnity of the moment, and his own role as representative of\\njustice. “You killed—and you must pay the consequences of your action.\\nI speak to you, not as a man, but as Justice, eternal Justice, which—”\\n\\nM. Hautet was interrupted—to his intense annoyance. The door was pushed\\nopen.\\n\\n“M. le juge, M. le juge,” stammered the attendant, “there is a lady who\\nsays—who says—”\\n\\n“Who says what?” cried the justly incensed magistrate. “This is highly\\nirregular. I forbid it—I absolutely forbid it.”\\n\\nBut a slender figure pushed the stammering gendarme aside. Dressed all\\nin black, with a long veil that hid her face, she advanced into the\\nroom.\\n\\nMy heart gave a sickening throb. She had come then! All my efforts were\\nin vain. Yet I could not but admire the courage that had led her to\\ntake this step so unfalteringly.\\n\\nShe raised her veil—and I gasped. For, though as like her as two peas,\\nthis girl was not Cinderella! On the other hand, now that I saw her\\nwithout the fair wig she had worn on the stage, I recognized her as the\\ngirl of the photograph in Jack Renauld’s room.\\n\\n“You are the Juge d’Instruction, M. Hautet?” she queried.\\n\\n“Yes, but I forbid—”\\n\\n“My name is Bella Duveen. I wish to give myself up for the murder of\\nMr. Renauld.”\\n\\n\\n\\n26 I Receive a Letter\\n\\n“_My Friend:___\\n    “You will know all when you get this. Nothing that I can say will\\n    move Bella. She has gone out to give herself up. I am tired out\\n    with struggling.\\n    “You will know now that I deceived you, that where you gave me\\n    trust I repaid you with lies. It will seem, perhaps, indefensible\\n    to you, but I should like, before I go out of your life for ever,\\n    to show you just how it all came about. If I knew that you forgave\\n    me, it would make life easier for me. It wasn’t for myself I did\\n    it—that’s the only thing I can put forward to say for myself.\\n    “I’ll begin from the day I met you in the boat train from Paris. I\\n    was uneasy then about Bella. She was just desperate about Jack\\n    Renauld, she’d have lain down on the ground for him to walk on, and\\n    when he began to change, and to stop writing so often, she began\\n    getting in a state. She got it into her head that he was keen on\\n    another girl—and of course, as it turned out afterwards, she was\\n    quite right there. She’d made up her mind to go to their Villa at\\n    Merlinville, and try and see Jack. She knew I was against it, and\\n    tried to give me the slip. I found she was not on the train at\\n    Calais, and determined I would not go on to England without her.\\n    I’d an uneasy feeling that something awful was going to happen if I\\n    couldn’t prevent it.\\n    “I met the next train from Paris. She was on it, and set upon going\\n    out then and there to Merlinville. I argued with her for all I was\\n    worth, but it wasn’t any good. She was all strung up and set upon\\n    having her own way. Well, I washed my hands of it. I’d done all I\\n    could! It was getting late. I went to an hotel, and Bella started\\n    for Merlinville. I still couldn’t shake off my feeling of what the\\n    books call ‘impending disaster.’\\n    “The next day came—but no Bella. She’d made a date with me to meet\\n    at the hotel, but she didn’t keep it. No sign of her all day. I got\\n    more and more anxious. Then came an evening paper with the news.\\n    “It was awful! I couldn’t be sure, of course—but I was terribly\\n    afraid. I figured it out that Bella had met Papa Renauld and told\\n    him about her and Jack, and that he’d insulted her or something\\n    like that. We’ve both got terribly quick tempers.\\n    “Then all the masked foreigner business came out, and I began to\\n    feel more at ease. But it still worried me that Bella hadn’t kept\\n    her date with me.\\n    “By the next morning, I was so rattled that I’d just got to go and\\n    see what I could. First thing, I ran up against you. You know all\\n    that\\u200a… When I saw the dead man, looking so like Jack, and wearing\\n    Jack’s fancy overcoat, I knew! And there was the identical\\n    paper-knife—wicked little thing!—that Jack had given Bella! Ten to\\n    one it had her finger-marks on it. I can’t hope to explain to you\\n    the sort of helpless horror of that moment. I only saw one thing\\n    clearly—I must get hold of that dagger, and get right away with it\\n    before they found out it was gone. I pretended to faint, and whilst\\n    you were away getting water I took the thing and hid it away in my\\n    dress.\\n    “I told you that I was staying at the Hôtel du Phare, but of course\\n    really I made a bee line back to Calais, and then on to England by\\n    the first boat. When we were in mid-Channel, I dropped that little\\n    devil of a dagger into the sea. Then I felt I could breathe again.\\n    “Bella was at our digs in London. She looked like nothing on God’s\\n    earth. I told her what I’d done, and that she was pretty safe for\\n    the time being. She stared at me, and then began laughing\\u200a…\\n    laughing\\u200a… laughing\\u200a… it was horrible to hear her! I felt that the\\n    best thing to do was to keep busy. She’d go mad if she had time to\\n    brood on what she’d done. Luckily we got an engagement at once.\\n    “And then, I saw you and your friend, watching us that night\\u200a… I\\n    was frantic. You must suspect, or you wouldn’t have tracked us\\n    down. I had to know the worst, so I followed you. I was desperate.\\n    And then, before I’d had time to say anything, I tumbled to it that\\n    it was _me___ you suspected, not Bella! Or at least that you\\n    thought I _was___ Bella since I’d stolen the dagger.\\n    “I wish, honey, that you could see back into my mind at that\\n    moment\\u200a… you’d forgive me, perhaps\\u200a… I was so frightened, and\\n    muddled, and desperate.\\u200a… All I could get clearly was that you\\n    would try and save me. I didn’t know whether you’d be willing to\\n    save her\\u200a… I thought very likely not—it wasn’t the same thing! And\\n    I couldn’t risk it! Bella’s my twin—I’d got to do the best for her.\\n    So I went on lying.\\u200a… I felt mean—I feel mean still.\\u200a… That’s\\n    all—enough too, you’ll say, I expect. I ought to have trusted\\n    you.\\u200a… If I had—\\n    “As soon as the news was in the paper that Jack Renauld had been\\n    arrested, it was all up. Bella wouldn’t even wait to see how things\\n    went.\\u200a…\\n    “I’m very tired.\\u200a… I can’t write any more.\\u200a…”\\n\\n\\nShe had begun to sign herself Cinderella, but had crossed that out and\\nwritten instead “Dulcie Duveen.”\\n\\nIt was an ill-written, blurred epistle but I have kept it to this day.\\n\\nPoirot was with me when I read it. The sheets fell from my hand, and I\\nlooked across at him.\\n\\n“Did you know all the time that it was—the other?”\\n\\n“Yes, my friend.”\\n\\n“Why did you not tell me?”\\n\\n“To begin with, I could hardly believe it conceivable that you could\\nmake such a mistake. You had seen the photograph. The sisters are very\\nalike, but by no means incapable of distinguishment.”\\n\\n“But the fair hair?”\\n\\n“A wig, worn for the sake of a piquant contrast on the stage. Is it\\nconceivable that with twins one should be fair and one dark?”\\n\\n“Why didn’t you tell me that night at the hotel in Coventry?”\\n\\n“You were rather high-handed in your methods, _mon ami___,” said Poirot\\ndryly. “You did not give me a chance.”\\n\\n“But afterwards?”\\n\\n“Ah, afterwards! Well, to begin with, I was hurt at your want of faith\\nin me. And then, I wanted to see whether your—feelings would stand the\\ntest of time. In fact, whether it was love, or a flash in the pan, with\\nyou. I should not have left you long in your error.”\\n\\nI nodded. His tone was too affectionate for me to bear resentment. I\\nlooked down on the sheets of the letter. Suddenly I picked them up from\\nthe floor, and pushed them across to him.\\n\\n“Read that,” I said. “I’d like you to.”\\n\\nHe read it through in silence, then he looked up at me.\\n\\n“What is it that worries you, Hastings?”\\n\\nThis was quite a new mood in Poirot. His mocking manner seemed laid\\nquite aside. I was able to say what I wanted without too much\\ndifficulty.\\n\\n“She doesn’t say—she doesn’t say—well, not whether she cares for me or\\nnot!”\\n\\nPoirot turned back the pages.\\n\\n“I think you are mistaken, Hastings.”\\n\\n“Where?” I cried, leaning forward eagerly.\\n\\nPoirot smiled.\\n\\n“She tells you that in every line of the letter, _mon ami___.”\\n\\n“But where am I to find her? There’s no address on the letter. There’s\\na French stamp, that’s all.”\\n\\n“Excite yourself not! Leave it to Papa Poirot. I can find her for you\\nas soon as I have five little minutes!”\\n\\n\\n\\n27 Jack Renauld’s Story\\n\\n“Congratulations, M. Jack,” said Poirot, wringing the lad warmly by the\\nhand.\\n\\nYoung Renauld had come to us as soon as he was liberated—before\\nstarting for Merlinville to rejoin Marthe and his mother. Stonor\\naccompanied him. His heartiness was in strong contrast to the lad’s wan\\nlooks. It was plain that the boy was on the verge of a nervous\\nbreakdown. Although delivered from the immediate peril that was hanging\\nover him, the circumstances of his release were too painful to let him\\nfeel full relief. He smiled mournfully at Poirot, and said in a low\\nvoice:\\n\\n“I went through it to protect her, and now it’s all no use!”\\n\\n“You could hardly expect the girl to accept the price of your life,”\\nremarked Stonor dryly. “She was bound to come forward when she saw you\\nheading straight for the guillotine.”\\n\\n“_Eh ma foi!___ and you were heading for it too!” added Poirot, with a\\nslight twinkle. “You would have had Maître Grosíer’s death from rage on\\nyour conscience if you had gone on.”\\n\\n“He was a well meaning ass, I suppose,” said Jack. “But he worried me\\nhorribly. You see, I couldn’t very well take him into my confidence.\\nBut, my God! what’s going to happen about Bella?”\\n\\n“If I were you,” said Poirot frankly, “I should not distress myself\\nunduly. The French Courts are very lenient to youth and beauty, and the\\n_crime passionnel___. A clever lawyer will make out a great case of\\nextenuating circumstances. It will not be pleasant for you—”\\n\\n“I don’t care about that. You see, M. Poirot, in a way I _do___ feel\\nguilty of my father’s murder. But for me, and my entanglement with this\\ngirl, he would be alive and well today. And then my cursed carelessness\\nin taking away the wrong overcoat. I can’t help feeling responsible for\\nhis death. It will haunt me for ever!”\\n\\n“No, no,” I said soothingly.\\n\\n“Of course it’s horrible to me to think that Bella killed my father,”\\nresumed Jack, “but I’d treated her shamefully. After I met Marthe, and\\nrealized I’d made a mistake, I ought to have written and told her so\\nhonestly. But I was so terrified of a row, and of its coming to\\nMarthe’s ears, and her thinking there was more in it than there ever\\nhad been, that—well, I was a coward, and went on hoping the thing would\\ndie down of itself. I just drifted, in fact—not realizing that I was\\ndriving the poor kid desperate. If she’d really knifed me, as she meant\\nto, I should have got no more than my deserts. And the way she’s come\\nforward now is downright plucky. I’d have stood the racket, you know—up\\nto the end.”\\n\\nHe was silent for a moment or two, and then burst out on another tack:\\n\\n“What gets me is why the Governor should be wandering about in\\nunderclothes and my overcoat at that time of night. I suppose he’d just\\ngiven the foreign johnnies the slip, and my mother must have made a\\nmistake about its being 2 o’clock when they came. Or—or, it wasn’t all\\na frame up, was it? I mean, my mother didn’t think—couldn’t\\nthink—that—that it was _me?___”\\n\\nPoirot reassured him quickly.\\n\\n“No, no, M. Jack. Have no fears on that score. As for the rest, I will\\nexplain it to you one of these days. It is rather curious. But will you\\nrecount to us exactly what did occur on that terrible evening?”\\n\\n“There’s very little to tell. I came from Cherbourg, as I told you, in\\norder to see Marthe before going to the other end of the world. The\\ntrain was late, and I decided to take the short cut across the golf\\nlinks. I could easily get into the grounds of the Villa Marguerite from\\nthere. I had nearly reached the place when—”\\n\\nHe paused and swallowed.\\n\\n“Yes?”\\n\\n“I heard a terrible cry. It wasn’t loud—a sort of choke and gasp—but it\\nfrightened me. For a moment I stood rooted to the spot. Then I came\\nround the corner of a bush. There was moonlight. I saw the grave, and a\\nfigure lying face downwards, with a dagger sticking in the back. And\\nthen—and then—I looked up and saw _her___. She was looking at me as\\nthough she saw a ghost—it’s what she must have thought me at first—all\\nexpression seemed frozen out of her face by horror. And then she gave a\\ncry, and turned and ran.”\\n\\nHe stopped, trying to master his emotion.\\n\\n“And afterwards?” asked Poirot gently.\\n\\n“I really don’t know. I stayed there for a time, dazed. And then I\\nrealized I’d better get away as fast as I could. It didn’t occur to me\\nthat they would suspect me, but I was afraid of being called upon to\\ngive evidence against her. I walked to St. Beauvais as I told you, and\\ngot a car from there back to Cherbourg.”\\n\\nA knock came at the door, and a page entered with a telegram which he\\ndelivered to Stonor. He tore it open. Then he got up from his seat.\\n\\n“Mrs. Renauld has regained consciousness,” he said.\\n\\n“Ah!” Poirot sprang to his feet. “Let us all go to Merlinville at\\nonce!”\\n\\nA hurried departure was made forthwith. Stonor, at Jack’s instance,\\nagreed to stay behind and do all that could be done for Bella Duveen.\\nPoirot, Jack Renauld and I set off in the Renauld car.\\n\\nThe run took just over forty minutes. As we approached the doorway of\\nthe Villa Marguerite, Jack Renauld shot a questioning glance at Poirot.\\n\\n“How would it be if you went on first—to break the news to my mother\\nthat I am free—”\\n\\n“While you break it in person to Mademoiselle Marthe, eh?” finished\\nPoirot, with a twinkle. “But yes, by all means, I was about to propose\\nsuch an arrangement myself.”\\n\\nJack Renauld did not wait for more. Stopping the car, he swung himself\\nout, and ran up the path to the front door. We went on in the car to\\nthe Villa Geneviève.\\n\\n“Poirot,” I said, “do you remember how we arrived here that first day?\\nAnd were met by the news of M. Renauld’s murder?”\\n\\n“Ah! yes, truly. Not so long ago, either. But what a lot of things have\\nhappened since then—especially for you, _mon ami!___”\\n\\n“Poirot, what have you done about finding Bel—I mean Dulcie?”\\n\\n“Calm yourself, Hastings. I arrange everything.”\\n\\n“You’re being a precious long time about it,” I grumbled.\\n\\nPoirot changed the subject.\\n\\n“Then the beginning, now the end,” he moralized, as we rang the bell.\\n“And, considered as a case, the end is profoundly unsatisfactory.”\\n\\n“Yes, indeed,” I sighed.\\n\\n“You are regarding it from the sentimental standpoint, Hastings. That\\nwas not my meaning. We will hope that Mademoiselle Bella will be dealt\\nwith leniently, and after all Jack Renauld cannot marry both the girls.\\nI spoke from a professional standpoint. This is not a crime well\\nordered and regular, such as a detective delights in. The _mise en\\nscène___ designed by Georges Conneau, that indeed is perfect, but the\\n_dénouement___—ah, no! A man killed by accident in a girl’s fit of\\nanger—ah, indeed, what order or method is there in that?”\\n\\nAnd in the midst of a fit of laughter on my part at Poirot’s\\npeculiarities, the door was opened by Françoise.\\n\\nPoirot explained that he must see Mrs. Renauld at once, and the old\\nwoman conducted him upstairs. I remained in the _salon___. It was some\\ntime before Poirot reappeared. He was looking unusually grave.\\n\\n“_Vous voilà___, Hastings! _Sacré tonnerre___, but there are squalls\\nahead!”\\n\\n“What do you mean?” I cried.\\n\\n“I would hardly have credited it,” said Poirot thoughtfully, “but women\\nare very unexpected.”\\n\\n“Here are Jack and Marthe Daubreuil,” I exclaimed, looking out of the\\nwindow.\\n\\nPoirot bounded out of the room, and met the young couple on the steps\\noutside.\\n\\n“Do not enter. It is better not. Your mother is very upset.”\\n\\n“I know, I know,” said Jack Renauld. “I must go up to her at once.”\\n\\n“But no, I tell you. It is better not.”\\n\\n“But Marthe and I—”\\n\\n“In any case, do not take Mademoiselle with you. Mount, if you must,\\nbut you would be wise to be guided by me.”\\n\\nA voice on the stairs behind made us all start.\\n\\n“I thank you for your good offices, M. Poirot, but I will make my own\\nwishes clear.”\\n\\nWe stared in astonishment. Descending the stairs, leaning upon Léonie’s\\narm, was Mrs. Renauld, her head still bandaged. The French girl was\\nweeping, and imploring her mistress to return to bed.\\n\\n“Madame will kill herself. It is contrary to all the doctor’s orders!”\\n\\nBut Mrs. Renauld came on.\\n\\n“Mother,” cried Jack, starting forward. But with a gesture she drove\\nhim back.\\n\\n“I am no mother of yours! You are no son of mine! From this day and\\nhour I renounce you.”\\n\\n“Mother,” cried the lad, stupefied.\\n\\nFor a moment she seemed to waver, to falter before the anguish in his\\nvoice. Poirot made a mediating gesture, but instantly she regained\\ncommand of herself.\\n\\n“Your father’s blood is on your head. You are morally guilty of his\\ndeath. You thwarted and defied him over this girl, and by your\\nheartless treatment of another girl, you brought about his death. Go\\nout from my house. Tomorrow I intend to take such steps as shall make\\nit certain that you shall never touch a penny of his money. Make your\\nway in the world as best you can with the help of the girl who is the\\ndaughter of your father’s bitterest enemy!”\\n\\nAnd slowly, painfully, she retraced her way upstairs.\\n\\nWe were all dumbfounded—totally unprepared for such a demonstration.\\nJack Renauld, worn out with all he had already gone through, swayed and\\nnearly fell. Poirot and I went quickly to his assistance.\\n\\n“He is overdone,” murmured Poirot to Marthe. “Where can we take him?”\\n\\n“But home! To the Villa Marguerite. We will nurse him, my mother and I.\\nMy poor Jack!”\\n\\nWe got the lad to the Villa, where he dropped limply on to a chair in a\\nsemi-dazed condition. Poirot felt his head and hands.\\n\\n“He has fever. The long strain begins to tell. And now this shock on\\ntop of it. Get him to bed, and Hastings and I will summon a doctor.”\\n\\nA doctor was soon procured. After examining the patient, he gave it as\\nhis opinion that it was simply a case of nerve strain. With perfect\\nrest and quiet, the lad might be almost restored by the next day, but,\\nif excited, there was a chance of brain fever. It would be advisable\\nfor some one to sit up all night with him.\\n\\nFinally, having done all we could, we left him in the charge of Marthe\\nand her mother, and set out for the town. It was past our usual hour of\\ndining, and we were both famished. The first restaurant we came to\\nassuaged the pangs of hunger with an excellent _omelette___, and an\\nequally excellent _entrecôte___ to follow.\\n\\n“And now for quarters for the night,” said Poirot, when at length _café\\nnoir___ had completed the meal. “Shall we try our old friend, the Hôtel\\ndes Bains?”\\n\\nWe traced our steps there without more ado. Yes, Messieurs could be\\naccommodated with two good rooms overlooking the sea. Then Poirot asked\\na question which surprised me.\\n\\n“Has an English lady, Miss Robinson, arrived?”\\n\\n“Yes, monsieur. She is in the little _salon___.”\\n\\n“Ah!”\\n\\n“Poirot,” I cried, keeping pace with him as he walked along the\\ncorridor, “who on earth is Miss Robinson?”\\n\\nPoirot beamed kindly on me.\\n\\n“It is that I have arranged you a marriage, Hastings.”\\n\\n“But, I say—”\\n\\n“Bah!” said Poirot, giving me a friendly push over the threshold of the\\ndoor. “Do you think I wish to trumpet aloud in Merlinville the name of\\nDuveen?”\\n\\nIt was indeed Cinderella who rose to greet us. I took her hands in both\\nof mine. My eyes said the rest.\\n\\nPoirot cleared his throat.\\n\\n“_Mes enfants___,” he said, “for the moment we have no time for\\nsentiment. There is work ahead of us. Mademoiselle, were you able to do\\nwhat I asked you?”\\n\\nIn response, Cinderella took from her bag an object wrapped up in\\npaper, and handed it silently to Poirot. The latter unwrapped it. I\\ngave a start—for it was the aeroplane dagger which I understood she had\\ncast into the sea. Strange, how reluctant women always are to destroy\\nthe most compromising of objects and documents!\\n\\n“_Très bien, mon enfant___,” said Poirot. “I am pleased with you. Go\\nnow and rest yourself. Hastings here and I have work to do. You shall\\nsee him tomorrow.”\\n\\n“Where are you going?” asked the girl, her eyes widening.\\n\\n“You shall hear all about it tomorrow.”\\n\\n“Because wherever you’re going, I’m coming too.”\\n\\n“But mademoiselle—”\\n\\n“I’m coming too, I tell you.”\\n\\nPoirot realized that it was futile to argue further. He gave in.\\n\\n“Come then, mademoiselle. But it will not be amusing. In all\\nprobability nothing will happen.”\\n\\nThe girl made no reply.\\n\\nTwenty minutes later we set forth. It was quite dark now, a close,\\noppressive evening. Poirot led the way out of the town in the direction\\nof the Villa Geneviève. But when he reached the Villa Marguerite he\\npaused.\\n\\n“I should like to assure myself that all goes well with Jack Renauld.\\nCome with me, Hastings. Mademoiselle will perhaps remain outside.\\nMadame Daubreuil might say something which would wound her.”\\n\\nWe unlatched the gate, and walked up the path. As we went round to the\\nside of the house, I drew Poirot’s attention to a window on the first\\nfloor. Thrown sharply on the blind was the profile of Marthe Daubreuil.\\n\\n“Ah!” said Poirot. “I figure to myself that that is the room where we\\nshall find Jack Renauld.”\\n\\nMadame Daubreuil opened the door to us. She explained that Jack was\\nmuch the same, but perhaps we would like to see for ourselves. She led\\nus upstairs and into the bedroom. Marthe Daubreuil was embroidering by\\na table with a lamp on it. She put her finger to her lips as we\\nentered.\\n\\nJack Renauld was sleeping an uneasy fitful sleep, his head turning from\\nside to side, and his face still unduly flushed.\\n\\n“Is the doctor coming again?” asked Poirot in a whisper.\\n\\n“Not unless we send. He is sleeping—that is the great thing. _Maman___\\nmade him a tisane.”\\n\\nShe sat down again with her embroidery as we left the room. Madame\\nDaubreuil accompanied us down the stairs. Since I had learned of her\\npast history, I viewed this woman with increased interest. She stood\\nthere with her eyes cast down, the same very faint enigmatical smile\\nthat I remembered on her lips. And suddenly I felt afraid of her, as\\none might feel afraid of a beautiful poisonous snake.\\n\\n“I hope we have not deranged you, madame,” said Poirot politely as she\\nopened the door for us to pass out.\\n\\n“Not at all, monsieur.”\\n\\n“By the way,” said Poirot, as though struck by an afterthought, “M.\\nStonor has not been in Merlinville today, has he?”\\n\\nI could not at all fathom the point of this question which I well knew\\nto be meaningless as far as Poirot was concerned.\\n\\nMadame Daubreuil replied quite composedly:\\n\\n“Not that I know of.”\\n\\n“He has not had an interview with Mrs. Renauld?”\\n\\n“How should I know that, monsieur?”\\n\\n“True,” said Poirot. “I thought you might have seen him coming or\\ngoing, that is all. Good night, madame.”\\n\\n“Why—” I began.\\n\\n“No ‘_whys___,’ Hastings. There will be time for that later.”\\n\\nWe rejoined Cinderella and made our way rapidly in the direction of the\\nVilla Geneviève. Poirot looked over his shoulder once at the lighted\\nwindow and the profile of Marthe as she bent over her work.\\n\\n“He is being guarded at all events,” he muttered.\\n\\nArrived at the Villa Geneviève, Poirot took up his stand behind some\\nbushes to the left of the drive, where, whilst enjoying a good view\\nourselves, we were completely hidden from sight. The Villa itself was\\nin total darkness, everybody was without doubt in bed and asleep. We\\nwere almost immediately under the window of Mrs. Renauld’s bedroom,\\nwhich window, I noticed, was open. It seemed to me that it was upon\\nthis spot that Poirot’s eyes were fixed.\\n\\n“What are we going to do?” I whispered.\\n\\n“Watch.”\\n\\n“But—”\\n\\n“I do not expect anything to happen for at least an hour, probably two\\nhours, but the—”\\n\\nBut his words were interrupted by a long thin drawn cry:\\n\\n“Help!”\\n\\nA light flashed up in the second floor room on the right hand side of\\nthe house. The cry came from there. And even as we watched there came a\\nshadow on the blind as of two people struggling.\\n\\n“_Mille tonnerres!___” cried Poirot. “She must have changed her room!”\\n\\nDashing forward, he battered wildly on the front door. Then rushing to\\nthe tree in the flower-bed, he swarmed up it with the agility of a cat.\\nI followed him, as with a bound he sprang in through the open window.\\nLooking over my shoulder, I saw Dulcie reaching the branch behind me.\\n\\n“Take care,” I exclaimed.\\n\\n“Take care of your grandmother!” retorted the girl. “This is child’s\\nplay to me.”\\n\\nPoirot had rushed through the empty room and was pounding on the door\\nleading into the corridor.\\n\\n“Locked and bolted on the outside,” he growled. “And it will take time\\nto burst it open.”\\n\\nThe cries for help were getting noticeably fainter. I saw despair in\\nPoirot’s eyes. He and I together put our shoulders to the door.\\n\\nCinderella’s voice, calm and dispassionate, came from the window:\\n\\n“You’ll be too late, I guess I’m the only one who can do anything.”\\n\\nBefore I could move a hand to stop her, she appeared to leap upward\\ninto space. I rushed and looked out. To my horror, I saw her hanging by\\nher hands from the roof, propelling herself along by jerks in the\\ndirection of the lighted window.\\n\\n“Good heavens! She’ll be killed,” I cried.\\n\\n“You forget. She’s a professional acrobat, Hastings. It was the\\nprovidence of the good God that made her insist on coming with us\\ntonight. I only pray that she may be in time. Ah!”\\n\\nA cry of absolute terror floated out on to the night as the girl\\ndisappeared through the right-hand window; then in Cinderella’s clear\\ntones came the words:\\n\\n“No, you don’t! I’ve got you—and my wrists are just like steel.”\\n\\nAt the same moment the door of our prison was opened cautiously by\\nFrançoise. Poirot brushed her aside unceremoniously and rushed down the\\npassage to where the other maids were grouped round the further door.\\n\\n“It’s locked on the inside, monsieur.”\\n\\nThere was the sound of a heavy fall within. After a moment or two the\\nkey turned and the door swung slowly open. Cinderella, very pale,\\nbeckoned us in.\\n\\n“She is safe?” demanded Poirot.\\n\\n“Yes, I was just in time. She was exhausted.”\\n\\nMrs. Renauld was half sitting, half lying on the bed. She was gasping\\nfor breath.\\n\\n“Nearly strangled me,” she murmured painfully. The girl picked up\\nsomething from the floor and handed it to Poirot. It was a rolled up\\nladder of silk rope, very fine but quite strong.\\n\\n“A getaway,” said Poirot. “By the window, whilst we were battering at\\nthe door. Where is—the other?”\\n\\nThe girl stood aside a little and pointed. On the ground lay a figure\\nwrapped in some dark material a fold of which hid the face.\\n\\n“Dead?”\\n\\nShe nodded.\\n\\n“I think so.”\\n\\n“Head must have struck the marble fender.”\\n\\n“But who is it?” I cried.\\n\\n“The murderer of M. Renauld, Hastings. And the would-be murderer of\\nMadame Renauld.”\\n\\nPuzzled and uncomprehending, I knelt down, and lifting the fold of\\ncloth, looked into the dead beautiful face of Marthe Daubreuil!\\n\\n\\n\\n28 Journey’s End\\n\\nI have confused memories of the further events of that night. Poirot\\nseemed deaf to my repeated questions. He was engaged in overwhelming\\nFrançoise with reproaches for not having told him of Mrs. Renauld’s\\nchange of sleeping quarters.\\n\\nI caught him by the shoulder, determined to attract his attention, and\\nmake myself heard.\\n\\n“But you _must___ have known,” I expostulated. “You were taken up to\\nsee her this afternoon.”\\n\\nPoirot deigned to attend to me for a brief moment.\\n\\n“She had been wheeled on a sofa into the middle room—her boudoir,” he\\nexplained.\\n\\n“But, monsieur,” cried Françoise, “Madame changed her room almost\\nimmediately after the crime! The associations—they were too\\ndistressing!”\\n\\n“Then why was I not told,” vociferated Poirot, striking the table, and\\nworking himself into a first-class passion. “I demand\\nyou—why—was—I—not—told? You are an old woman completely imbecile! And\\nLéonie and Denise are no better. All of you are triple idiots! Your\\nstupidity has nearly caused the death of your mistress. But for this\\ncourageous child—”\\n\\nHe broke off, and, darting across the room to where the girl was\\nbending over ministering to Mrs. Renauld, he embraced her with Gallic\\nfervour—slightly to my annoyance.\\n\\nI was aroused from my condition of mental fog by a sharp command from\\nPoirot to fetch the doctor immediately on Mrs. Renauld’s behalf. After\\nthat, I might summon the police. And he added, to complete my dudgeon:\\n\\n“It will hardly be worth your while to return here. I shall be too busy\\nto attend to you, and of Mademoiselle here I make a _garde-malad___.”\\n\\nI retired with what dignity I could command. Having done my errands, I\\nreturned to the hotel. I understood next to nothing of what had\\noccurred. The events of the night seemed fantastic and impossible.\\nNobody would answer my questions. Nobody had seemed to hear them.\\nAngrily, I flung myself into bed, and slept the sleep of the bewildered\\nand utterly exhausted.\\n\\nI awoke to find the sun pouring in through the open windows and Poirot,\\nneat and smiling, sitting beside the bed.\\n\\n“_Enfin___ you wake! But it is that you are a famous sleeper, Hastings!\\nDo you know that it is nearly eleven o’clock?”\\n\\nI groaned and put a hand to my head.\\n\\n“I must have been dreaming,” I said. “Do you know, I actually dreamt\\nthat we found Marthe Daubreuil’s body in Mrs. Renauld’s room, and that\\nyou declared her to have murdered Mr. Renauld?”\\n\\n“You were not dreaming. All that is quite true.”\\n\\n“But Bella Duveen killed Mr. Renauld?”\\n\\n“Oh, no, Hastings, she did not! She said she did—yes—but that was to\\nsave the man she loved from the guillotine.”\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“Remember Jack Renauld’s story. They both arrived on the scene at the\\nsame instant, and each took the other to be the perpetrator of the\\ncrime. The girl stares at him in horror, and then with a cry rushes\\naway. But, when she hears that the crime has been brought home to him,\\nshe cannot bear it, and comes forward to accuse herself and save him\\nfrom certain death.”\\n\\nPoirot leaned back in his chair, and brought the tips of his fingers\\ntogether in familiar style.\\n\\n“The case was not quite satisfactory to me,” he observed judicially.\\n“All along I was strongly under the impression that we were dealing\\nwith a cold-blooded and premeditated crime committed by some one who\\nhad been contented (very cleverly) with using M. Renauld’s own plans\\nfor throwing the police off the track. The great criminal (as you may\\nremember my remarking to you once) is always supremely simple.”\\n\\nI nodded.\\n\\n“Now, to support this theory, the criminal must have been fully\\ncognizant of Mr. Renauld’s plans. That leads us to Madame Renauld. But\\nfacts fail to support any theory of her guilt. Is there any one else\\nwho might have known of them? Yes. From Marthe Daubreuil’s own lips we\\nhave the admission that she overheard M. Renauld’s quarrel with the\\ntramp. If she could overhear that, there is no reason why she should\\nnot have heard everything else, especially if M. and Madame Renauld\\nwere imprudent enough to discuss their plans sitting on the bench.\\nRemember how easily you overheard Marthe’s conversation with Jack\\nRenauld from that spot.”\\n\\n“But what possible motive could Marthe have for murdering Mr. Renauld?”\\nI argued.\\n\\n“What motive? Money! M. Renauld was a millionaire several times over,\\nand at his death (or so she and Jack believed) half that vast fortune\\nwould pass to his son. Let us reconstruct the scene from the standpoint\\nof Marthe Daubreuil.\\n\\n“Marthe Daubreuil overhears what passes between Renauld and his wife.\\nSo far he has been a nice little source of income to the Daubreuil\\nmother and daughter, but now he proposes to escape from their toils. At\\nfirst, possibly, her idea is to prevent that escape. But a bolder idea\\ntakes its place, and one that fails to horrify the daughter of Jeanne\\nBeroldy! At present M. Renauld stands inexorably in the way of her\\nmarriage with Jack. If the latter defies his father, he will be a\\npauper—which is not at all to the mind of Mademoiselle Marthe. In fact,\\nI doubt if she has ever cared a straw for Jack Renauld. She can\\nsimulate emotion, but in reality she is of the same cold, calculating\\ntype as her mother. I doubt, too, whether she was really very sure of\\nher hold over the boy’s affections. She had dazzled and captivated him,\\nbut separated from her, as his father could so easily manage to\\nseparate him, she might lose him. But with M. Renauld dead, and Jack\\nthe heir to half his millions, the marriage can take place at once, and\\nat a stroke she will attain wealth—not the beggarly thousands that have\\nbeen extracted from him so far. And her clever brain takes in the\\nsimplicity of the thing. It is all so easy. M. Renauld is planning all\\nthe circumstances of his death—she has only to step in at the right\\nmoment and turn the farce into a grim reality. And here comes in the\\nsecond point which led me infallibly to Marthe Daubreuil—the dagger!\\nJack Renauld had _three___ souvenirs made. One he gave to his mother,\\none to Bella Duveen; was it not highly probable that he had given the\\nthird one to Marthe Daubreuil?\\n\\n“So then, to sum up, there were four points of note against Marthe\\nDaubreuil:\\n\\n“(1) Marthe Daubreuil could have overheard M. Renauld’s plans.\\n\\n“(2) Marthe Daubreuil had a direct interest in causing M. Renauld’s\\ndeath.\\n\\n“(3) Marthe Daubreuil was the daughter of the notorious Madame Beroldy\\nwho in my opinion was morally and virtually the murderess of her\\nhusband, although it may have been Georges Conneau’s hand which struck\\nthe actual blow.\\n\\n“(4) Marthe Daubreuil was the only person, besides Jack Renauld, likely\\nto have the third dagger in her possession.”\\n\\nPoirot paused and cleared his throat.\\n\\n“Of course, when I learned of the existence of the other girl, Bella\\nDuveen, I realized that it was quite possible that _she___ might have\\nkilled M. Renauld. The solution did not commend itself to me, because,\\nas I pointed out to you, Hastings, an expert, such as I am, likes to\\nmeet a foeman worthy of his steel. Still one must take crimes as one\\nfinds them, not as one would like them to be. It did not seem very\\nlikely that Bella Duveen would be wandering about carrying a souvenir\\npaper-knife in her hand, but of course she might have had some idea all\\nthe time of revenging herself on Jack Renauld. When she actually came\\nforward and confessed to the murder, it seemed that all was over. And\\nyet—I was not satisfied, _mon ami___. _I was not satisfied.\\u200a…___\\n\\n“I went over the case again minutely, and I came to the same conclusion\\nas before. If it was _not___ Bella Duveen, the only other person who\\ncould have committed the crime was Marthe Daubreuil. But I had not one\\nsingle proof against her!\\n\\n“And then you showed me that letter from Mademoiselle Dulcie, and I saw\\na chance of settling the matter once for all. The original dagger was\\nstolen by Dulcie Duveen and thrown into the sea—since, as she thought,\\nit belonged to her sister. But if, by any chance, it was _not___ her\\nsister’s, but the one given by Jack to Marthe Daubreuil—why then, Bella\\nDuveen’s dagger would be still intact! I said no word to you, Hastings\\n(it was no time for romance) but I sought out Mademoiselle Dulcie, told\\nher as much as I deemed needful, and set her to search amongst the\\neffects of her sister. Imagine my elation, when she sought me out\\n(according to my instructions) as Miss Robinson with the precious\\nsouvenir in her possession!\\n\\n“In the meantime I had taken steps to force Mademoiselle Marthe into\\nthe open. By my orders, Mrs. Renauld repulsed her son, and declared her\\nintention of making a will on the morrow which should cut him off from\\never enjoying even a portion of his father’s fortune. It was a\\ndesperate step, but a necessary one, and Madame Renauld was fully\\nprepared to take the risk—though unfortunately she also never thought\\nof mentioning her change of room. I suppose she took it for granted\\nthat I knew. All happened as I thought. Marthe Daubreuil made a last\\nbold bid for the Renauld millions—and failed!”\\n\\n“What absolutely bewilders me,” I said, “is how she ever got into the\\nhouse without our seeing her. It seems an absolute miracle. We left her\\nbehind at the Villa Marguerite, we go straight to the Villa\\nGeneviève—and yet she is there before us!”\\n\\n“Ah, but we did not leave her behind. She was out of the Villa\\nMarguerite by the back way whilst we were talking to her mother in the\\nhall. That is where, as the Americans say, she ‘put it over’ on Hercule\\nPoirot!”\\n\\n“But the shadow on the blind? We saw it from the road.”\\n\\n“_Eh bien___, when we looked up, Madame Daubreuil had just had time to\\nrun upstairs and take her place.”\\n\\n“Madame Daubreuil?”\\n\\n“Yes. One is old, and one is young, one dark, and one fair, but, for\\nthe purpose of a silhouette on a blind, their profiles are singularly\\nalike. Even I did not suspect—triple imbecile that I was! I thought I\\nhad plenty of time before me—that she would not try to gain admission\\nto the Villa until much later. She had brains, that beautiful\\nMademoiselle Marthe.”\\n\\n“And her object was to murder Mrs. Renauld?”\\n\\n“Yes. The whole fortune would then pass to her son. But it would have\\nbeen suicide, _mon ami!___ On the floor by Marthe Daubreuil’s body, I\\nfound a pad and a little bottle of chloroform and a hypodermic syringe\\ncontaining a fatal dose of morphine. You understand? The chloroform\\nfirst—then when the victim is unconscious the prick of the needle. By\\nthe morning the smell of the chloroform has quite disappeared, and the\\nsyringe lies where it has fallen from Madame Renauld’s hand. What would\\nhe say, the excellent M. Hautet? ‘Poor woman! What did I tell you? The\\nshock of joy, it was too much on top of the rest! Did I not say that I\\nshould not be surprised if her brain became unhinged. Altogether a most\\ntragic case, the Renauld Case!’\\n\\n“However, Hastings, things did not go quite as Mademoiselle Marthe had\\nplanned. To begin with, Madame Renauld was awake and waiting for her.\\nThere is a struggle. But Madame Renauld is terribly weak still. There\\nis a last chance for Marthe Daubreuil. The idea of suicide is at an\\nend, but if she can silence Madame Renauld with her strong hands, make\\na getaway with her little silk ladder whilst we are still battering on\\nthe inside of the further door, and be back at the Villa Marguerite\\nbefore we return there, it will be hard to prove anything against her.\\nBut she was checkmated—not by Hercule Poirot—but by _la petite\\nacrobate___ with her wrists of steel.”\\n\\nI mused over the whole story.\\n\\n“When did you first begin to suspect Marthe Daubreuil, Poirot? When she\\ntold us she had overheard the quarrel in the garden?”\\n\\nPoirot smiled.\\n\\n“My friend, do you remember when we drove into Merlinville that first\\nday? And the beautiful girl we saw standing at the gate? You asked me\\nif I had not noticed a young goddess, and I replied to you that I had\\nseen only a girl with anxious eyes. That is how I have thought of\\nMarthe Daubreuil from the beginning. _The girl with the anxious\\neyes!___ Why was she anxious? Not on Jack Renauld’s behalf, for she did\\nnot know then that he had been in Merlinville the previous evening.”\\n\\n“By the way,” I exclaimed, “how is Jack Renauld?”\\n\\n“Much better. He is still at the Villa Marguerite. But Madame Daubreuil\\nhas disappeared. The police are looking for her.”\\n\\n“Was she in with her daughter, do you think?”\\n\\n“We shall never know. Madame is a lady who can keep her secrets. And I\\ndoubt very much if the police will ever find her.”\\n\\n“Has Jack Renauld been—told?”\\n\\n“Not yet.”\\n\\n“It will be a terrible shock to him.”\\n\\n“Naturally. And yet, do you know, Hastings, I doubt if his heart was\\never seriously engaged. So far we have looked upon Bella Duveen as a\\nsiren, and Marthe Daubreuil as the girl he really loved. But I think\\nthat if we reversed the terms we should come nearer to the truth.\\nMarthe Daubreuil was very beautiful. She set herself to fascinate Jack,\\nand she succeeded, but remember his curious reluctance to break with\\nthe other girl. And see how he was willing to go to the guillotine\\nrather than implicate her. I have a little idea that when he learns the\\ntruth he will be horrified—revolted, and his false love will wither\\naway.”\\n\\n“What about Giraud?”\\n\\n“He has a _crise___ of the nerves, that one! He has been obliged to\\nreturn to Paris.”\\n\\nWe both smiled.\\n\\nPoirot proved a fairly true prophet. When at length the doctor\\npronounced Jack Renauld strong enough to hear the truth, it was Poirot\\nwho broke it to him. The shock was indeed terrific. Yet Jack rallied\\nbetter than I could have supposed possible. His mother’s devotion\\nhelped him to live through those difficult days. The mother and son\\nwere inseparable now.\\n\\nThere was a further revelation to come. Poirot had acquainted Mrs.\\nRenauld with the fact that he knew her secret, and had represented to\\nher that Jack should not be left in ignorance of his father’s past.\\n\\n“To hide the truth, never does it avail, madame! Be brave and tell him\\neverything.”\\n\\nWith a heavy heart Mrs. Renauld consented, and her son learned that the\\nfather he had loved had been in actual fact a fugitive from justice. A\\nhalting question was promptly answered by Poirot.\\n\\n“Reassure yourself, M. Jack. The world knows nothing. As far as I can\\nsee, there is no obligation for me to take the police into my\\nconfidence. Throughout the case I have acted, not for them, but for\\nyour father. Justice overtook him at last, but no one need ever know\\nthat he and Georges Conneau were one and the same.”\\n\\nThere were, of course, various points in the case that remained\\npuzzling to the police, but Poirot explained things in so plausible a\\nfashion that all query about them was gradually stilled.\\n\\nShortly after we got back to London, I noticed a magnificent model of a\\nfoxhound adorning Poirot’s mantelpiece. In answer to my inquiring\\nglance, Poirot nodded.\\n\\n“_Mais, oui!___ I got my 500 francs! Is he not a splendid fellow? I\\ncall him Giraud!”\\n\\nA few days later Jack Renauld came to see us with a resolute expression\\non his face.\\n\\n“M. Poirot, I’ve come to say good-bye. I’m sailing for South America\\nalmost immediately. My father had large interests over the continent,\\nand I mean to start a new life out there.”\\n\\n“You go alone, M. Jack?”\\n\\n“My mother comes with me—and I shall keep Stonor on as my secretary. He\\nlikes out of-the-way parts of the world.”\\n\\n“No one else goes with you?”\\n\\nJack flushed.\\n\\n“You mean—?”\\n\\n“A girl who loves you very dearly—who has been willing to lay down her\\nlife for you.”\\n\\n“How could I ask her?” muttered the boy. “After all that has happened,\\ncould I go to her and—oh, what sort of a lame story could I tell?”\\n\\n“_Les femmes___—they have a wonderful genius for manufacturing crutches\\nfor stories like that.”\\n\\n“Yes, but—I’ve been such a damned fool!”\\n\\n“So have all of us, at one time and another,” observed Poirot\\nphilosophically.\\n\\nBut Jack’s face had hardened.\\n\\n“There’s something else. I’m my father’s son. Would any one marry me,\\nknowing that?”\\n\\n“You are your father’s son, you say. Hastings here will tell you that I\\nbelieve in heredity—”\\n\\n“Well, then—”\\n\\n“Wait. I know a woman, a woman of courage and endurance, capable of\\ngreat love, of supreme self-sacrifice—”\\n\\nThe boy looked up. His eyes softened.\\n\\n“My mother!”\\n\\n“Yes. You are your mother’s son as well as your father’s. Go then to\\nMademoiselle Bella. Tell her everything. Keep nothing back—and see what\\nshe will say!”\\n\\nJack looked irresolute.\\n\\n“Go to her as a boy no longer, but a man—a man bowed by the fate of the\\nPast, and the fate of Today, but looking forward to a new and wonderful\\nlife. Ask her to share it with you. You may not realize it, but your\\nlove for each other has been tested in the fire and not found wanting.\\nYou have both been willing to lay down your lives for each other.”\\n\\nAnd what of Captain Arthur Hastings, humble chronicler of these pages?\\n\\nThere is some talk of his joining the Renaulds on a ranch across the\\nseas, but for the end of this story I prefer to go back to a morning in\\nthe garden of the Villa Geneviève.\\n\\n“I can’t call you Bella,” I said, “since it isn’t your name. And Dulcie\\nseems so unfamiliar. So it’s got to be Cinderella. Cinderella married\\nthe Prince, you remember. I’m not a Prince, but—”\\n\\nShe interrupted me.\\n\\n“Cinderella warned him, I’m sure! You see, she couldn’t promise to turn\\ninto a princess. She was only a little scullion after all—”\\n\\n“It’s the Prince’s turn to interrupt,” I interpolated. “Do you know\\nwhat he said?”\\n\\n“No?”\\n\\n“\\u200a‘Hell!’ said the Prince—and kissed her!”\\n\\nAnd I suited the action to the word.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Murder on the Links, by Agatha Christie\\n\",\n",

interest aroused in the public by what was known at the\\ntime as “the styles case” has now somewhat subsided. nevertheless, in\\nview of the world-wide notoriety which attended it, i have been asked,\\nboth by my friend poirot and the family themselves, to write an account\\nof the whole story. this, we trust, will effectually silence the\\nsensational rumours which still persist.\\n\\ni will therefore briefly set down the circumstances which led to my\\nbeing connected with the affair.\\n\\ni had been invalided home from the front; and, after spending some\\nmonths in a rather depressing convalescent home, was given a month’s\\nsick leave. having no near relations or friends, i was trying to make\\nup my mind what to do, when i ran across john cavendish. i had seen\\nvery little of him for some years. indeed, i had never known him\\nparticularly well. he was a good fifteen years my senior, for one\\nthing, though he hardly looked his forty-five years. as a boy, though,\\ni had often stayed at styles, his mother’s place in essex.\\n\\nwe had a good yarn about old times, and it ended in his inviting me\\ndown to styles to spend my leave there.\\n\\n“the mater will be delighted to see you again—after all those years,”\\nhe added.\\n\\n“your mother keeps well?” i asked.\\n\\n“oh, yes. i suppose you know that she has married again?”\\n\\ni am afraid i showed my surprise rather plainly. mrs. cavendish, who\\nhad married john’s father when he was a widower with two sons, had been\\na handsome woman of middle-age as i remembered her. she certainly could\\nnot be a day less than seventy now. i recalled her as an energetic,\\nautocratic personality, somewhat inclined to charitable and social\\nnotoriety, with a fondness for opening bazaars and playing the lady\\nbountiful. she was a most generous woman, and possessed a considerable\\nfortune of her own.\\n\\ntheir country-place, styles court, had been purchased by mr. cavendish\\nearly in their married life. he had been completely under his wife’s\\nascendancy, so much so that, on dying, he left the place to her for her\\nlifetime, as well as the larger part of his income; an arrangement that\\nwas distinctly unfair to his two sons. their step-mother, however, had\\nalways been most generous to them; indeed, they were so young at the\\ntime of their father’s remarriage that they always thought of her as\\ntheir own mother.\\n\\nlawrence, the younger, had been a delicate youth. he had qualified as a\\ndoctor but early relinquished the profession of medicine, and lived at\\nhome while pursuing literary ambitions; though his verses never had any\\nmarked success.\\n\\njohn practised for some time as a barrister, but had finally settled\\ndown to the more congenial life of a country squire. he had married two\\nyears ago, and had taken his wife to live at styles, though i\\nentertained a shrewd suspicion that he would have preferred his mother\\nto increase his allowance, which would have enabled him to have a home\\nof his own. mrs. cavendish, however, was a lady who liked to make her\\nown plans, and expected other people to fall in with them, and in this\\ncase she certainly had the whip hand, namely: the purse strings.\\n\\njohn noticed my surprise at the news of his mother’s remarriage and\\nsmiled rather ruefully.\\n\\n“rotten little bounder too!” he said savagely. “i can tell you,\\nhastings, it’s making life jolly difficult for us. as for evie—you\\nremember evie?”\\n\\n“no.”\\n\\n“oh, i suppose she was after your time. she’s the mater’s factotum,\\ncompanion, jack of all trades! a great sport—old evie! not precisely\\nyoung and beautiful, but as game as they make them.”\\n\\n“you were going to say——?”\\n\\n“oh, this fellow! he turned up from nowhere, on the pretext of being a\\nsecond cousin or something of evie’s, though she didn’t seem\\nparticularly keen to acknowledge the relationship. the fellow is an\\nabsolute outsider, anyone can see that. he’s got a great black beard,\\nand wears patent leather boots in all weathers! but the mater cottoned\\nto him at once, took him on as secretary—you know how she’s always\\nrunning a hundred societies?”\\n\\ni nodded.\\n\\n“well, of course the war has turned the hundreds into thousands. no\\ndoubt the fellow was very useful to her. but you could have knocked us\\nall down with a feather when, three months ago, she suddenly announced\\nthat she and alfred were engaged! the fellow must be at least twenty\\nyears younger than she is! it’s simply bare-faced fortune hunting; but\\nthere you are—she is her own mistress, and she’s married him.”\\n\\n“it must be a difficult situation for you all.”\\n\\n“difficult! it’s damnable!”\\n\\nthus it came about that, three days later, i descended from the train\\nat styles st. mary, an absurd little station, with no apparent reason\\nfor existence, perched up in the midst of green fields and country\\nlanes. john cavendish was waiting on the platform, and piloted me out\\nto the car.\\n\\n“got a drop or two of petrol still, you see,” he remarked. “mainly\\nowing to the mater’s activities.”\\n\\nthe village of styles st. mary was situated about two miles from the\\nlittle station, and styles court lay a mile the other side of it. it\\nwas a still, warm day in early july. as one looked out over the flat\\nessex country, lying so green and peaceful under the afternoon sun, it\\nseemed almost impossible to believe that, not so very far away, a great\\nwar was running its appointed course. i felt i had suddenly strayed\\ninto another world. as we turned in at the lodge gates, john said:\\n\\n“i’m afraid you’ll find it very quiet down here, hastings.”\\n\\n“my dear fellow, that’s just what i want.”\\n\\n“oh, it’s pleasant enough if you want to lead the idle life. i drill\\nwith the volunteers twice a week, and lend a hand at the farms. my wife\\nworks regularly ‘on the land’. she is up at five every morning to milk,\\nand keeps at it steadily until lunchtime. it’s a jolly good life taking\\nit all round—if it weren’t for that fellow alfred inglethorp!” he\\nchecked the car suddenly, and glanced at his watch. “i wonder if we’ve\\ntime to pick up cynthia. no, she’ll have started from the hospital by\\nnow.”\\n\\n“cynthia! that’s not your wife?”\\n\\n“no, cynthia is a protégée of my mother’s, the daughter of an old\\nschoolfellow of hers, who married a rascally solicitor. he came a\\ncropper, and the girl was left an orphan and penniless. my mother came\\nto the rescue, and cynthia has been with us nearly two years now. she\\nworks in the red cross hospital at tadminster, seven miles away.”\\n\\nas he spoke the last words, we drew up in front of the fine old house.\\na lady in a stout tweed skirt, who was bending over a flower bed,\\nstraightened herself at our approach.\\n\\n“hullo, evie, here’s our wounded hero! mr. hastings—miss howard.”\\n\\nmiss howard shook hands with a hearty, almost painful, grip. i had an\\nimpression of very blue eyes in a sunburnt face. she was a\\npleasant-looking woman of about forty, with a deep voice, almost manly\\nin its stentorian tones, and had a large sensible square body, with\\nfeet to match—these last encased in good thick boots. her conversation,\\ni soon found, was couched in the telegraphic style.\\n\\n“weeds grow like house afire. can’t keep even with ’em. shall press you\\nin. better be careful.”\\n\\n“i’m sure i shall be only too delighted to make myself useful,” i\\nresponded.\\n\\n“don’t say it. never does. wish you hadn’t later.”\\n\\n“you’re a cynic, evie,” said john, laughing. “where’s tea to-day—inside\\nor out?”\\n\\n“out. too fine a day to be cooped up in the house.”\\n\\n“come on then, you’ve done enough gardening for to-day. ‘the labourer\\nis worthy of his hire’, you know. come and be refreshed.”\\n\\n“well,” said miss howard, drawing off her gardening gloves, “i’m\\ninclined to agree with you.”\\n\\nshe led the way round the house to where tea was spread under the shade\\nof a large sycamore.\\n\\na figure rose from one of the basket chairs, and came a few steps to\\nmeet us.\\n\\n“my wife, hastings,” said john.\\n\\ni shall never forget my first sight of mary cavendish. her tall,\\nslender form, outlined against the bright light; the vivid sense of\\nslumbering fire that seemed to find expression only in those wonderful\\ntawny eyes of hers, remarkable eyes, different from any other woman’s\\nthat i have ever known; the intense power of stillness she possessed,\\nwhich nevertheless conveyed the impression of a wild untamed spirit in\\nan exquisitely civilised body—all these things are burnt into my\\nmemory. i shall never forget them.\\n\\nshe greeted me with a few words of pleasant welcome in a low clear\\nvoice, and i sank into a basket chair feeling distinctly glad that i\\nhad accepted john’s invitation. mrs. cavendish gave me some tea, and\\nher few quiet remarks heightened my first impression of her as a\\nthoroughly fascinating woman. an appreciative listener is always\\nstimulating, and i described, in a humorous manner, certain incidents\\nof my convalescent home, in a way which, i flatter myself, greatly\\namused my hostess. john, of course, good fellow though he is, could\\nhardly be called a brilliant conversationalist.\\n\\nat that moment a well remembered voice floated through the open french\\nwindow near at hand:\\n\\n“then you’ll write to the princess after tea, alfred? i’ll write to\\nlady tadminster for the second day, myself. or shall we wait until we\\nhear from the princess? in case of a refusal, lady tadminster might\\nopen it the first day, and mrs. crosbie the second. then there’s the\\nduchess—about the school fête.”\\n\\nthere was the murmur of a man’s voice, and then mrs. inglethorp’s rose\\nin reply:\\n\\n“yes, certainly. after tea will do quite well. you are so thoughtful,\\nalfred dear.”\\n\\nthe french window swung open a little wider, and a handsome\\nwhite-haired old lady, with a somewhat masterful cast of features,\\nstepped out of it on to the lawn. a man followed her, a suggestion of\\ndeference in his manner.\\n\\nmrs. inglethorp greeted me with effusion.\\n\\n“why, if it isn’t too delightful to see you again, mr. hastings, after\\nall these years. alfred, darling, mr. hastings—my husband.”\\n\\ni looked with some curiosity at “alfred darling”. he certainly struck a\\nrather alien note. i did not wonder at john objecting to his beard. it\\nwas one of the longest and blackest i have ever seen. he wore\\ngold-rimmed pince-nez, and had a curious impassivity of feature. it\\nstruck me that he might look natural on a stage, but was strangely out\\nof place in real life. his voice was rather deep and unctuous. he\\nplaced a wooden hand in mine and said:\\n\\n“this is a pleasure, mr. hastings.” then, turning to his wife: “emily\\ndearest, i think that cushion is a little damp.”\\n\\nshe beamed fondly on him, as he substituted another with every\\ndemonstration of the tenderest care. strange infatuation of an\\notherwise sensible woman!\\n\\nwith the presence of mr. inglethorp, a sense of constraint and veiled\\nhostility seemed to settle down upon the company. miss howard, in\\nparticular, took no pains to conceal her feelings. mrs. inglethorp,\\nhowever, seemed to notice nothing unusual. her volubility, which i\\nremembered of old, had lost nothing in the intervening years, and she\\npoured out a steady flood of conversation, mainly on the subject of the\\nforthcoming bazaar which she was organizing and which was to take place\\nshortly. occasionally she referred to her husband over a question of\\ndays or dates. his watchful and attentive manner never varied. from the\\nvery first i took a firm and rooted dislike to him, and i flatter\\nmyself that my first judgments are usually fairly shrewd.\\n\\npresently mrs. inglethorp turned to give some instructions about\\nletters to evelyn howard, and her husband addressed me in his\\npainstaking voice:\\n\\n“is soldiering your regular profession, mr. hastings?”\\n\\n“no, before the war i was in lloyd’s.”\\n\\n“and you will return there after it is over?”\\n\\n“perhaps. either that or a fresh start altogether.”\\n\\nmary cavendish leant forward.\\n\\n“what would you really choose as a profession, if you could just\\nconsult your inclination?”\\n\\n“well, that depends.”\\n\\n“no secret hobby?” she asked. “tell me—you’re drawn to something?\\neveryone is—usually something absurd.”\\n\\n“you’ll laugh at me.”\\n\\nshe smiled.\\n\\n“perhaps.”\\n\\n“well, i’ve always had a secret hankering to be a detective!”\\n\\n“the real thing—scotland yard? or sherlock holmes?”\\n\\n“oh, sherlock holmes by all means. but really, seriously, i am awfully\\ndrawn to it. i came across a man in belgium once, a very famous\\ndetective, and he quite inflamed me. he was a marvellous little fellow.\\nhe used to say that all good detective work was a mere matter of\\nmethod. my system is based on his—though of course i have progressed\\nrather further. he was a funny little man, a great dandy, but\\nwonderfully clever.”\\n\\n“like a good detective story myself,” remarked miss howard. “lots of\\nnonsense written, though. criminal discovered in last chapter. everyone\\ndumbfounded. real crime—you’d know at once.”\\n\\n“there have been a great number of undiscovered crimes,” i argued.\\n\\n“don’t mean the police, but the people that are right in it. the\\nfamily. you couldn’t really hoodwink them. they’d know.”\\n\\n“then,” i said, much amused, “you think that if you were mixed up in a\\ncrime, say a murder, you’d be able to spot the murderer right off?”\\n\\n“of course i should. mightn’t be able to prove it to a pack of lawyers.\\nbut i’m certain i’d know. i’d feel it in my fingertips if he came near\\nme.”\\n\\n“it might be a ‘she’,” i suggested.\\n\\n“might. but murder’s a violent crime. associate it more with a man.”\\n\\n“not in a case of poisoning.” mrs. cavendish’s clear voice startled me.\\n“dr. bauerstein was saying yesterday that, owing to the general\\nignorance of the more uncommon poisons among the medical profession,\\nthere were probably countless cases of poisoning quite unsuspected.”\\n\\n“why, mary, what a gruesome conversation!” cried mrs. inglethorp. “it\\nmakes me feel as if a goose were walking over my grave. oh, there’s\\ncynthia!”\\n\\na young girl in v.a.d. uniform ran lightly across the lawn.\\n\\n“why, cynthia, you are late to-day. this is mr. hastings—miss murdoch.”\\n\\ncynthia murdoch was a fresh-looking young creature, full of life and\\nvigour. she tossed off her little v.a.d. cap, and i admired the great\\nloose waves of her auburn hair, and the smallness and whiteness of the\\nhand she held out to claim her tea. with dark eyes and eyelashes she\\nwould have been a beauty.\\n\\nshe flung herself down on the ground beside john, and as i handed her a\\nplate of sandwiches she smiled up at me.\\n\\n“sit down here on the grass, do. it’s ever so much nicer.”\\n\\ni dropped down obediently.\\n\\n“you work at tadminster, don’t you, miss murdoch?”\\n\\nshe nodded.\\n\\n“for my sins.”\\n\\n“do they bully you, then?” i asked, smiling.\\n\\n“i should like to see them!” cried cynthia with dignity.\\n\\n“i have got a cousin who is nursing,” i remarked. “and she is terrified\\nof ‘sisters’.”\\n\\n“i don’t wonder. sisters _are_, you know, mr. hastings. they simp-ly\\n_are_! you’ve no idea! but i’m not a nurse, thank heaven, i work in the\\ndispensary.”\\n\\n“how many people do you poison?” i asked, smiling.\\n\\ncynthia smiled too.\\n\\n“oh, hundreds!” she said.\\n\\n“cynthia,” called mrs. inglethorp, “do you think you could write a few\\nnotes for me?”\\n\\n“certainly, aunt emily.”\\n\\nshe jumped up promptly, and something in her manner reminded me that\\nher position was a dependent one, and that mrs. inglethorp, kind as she\\nmight be in the main, did not allow her to forget it.\\n\\nmy hostess turned to me.\\n\\n“john will show you your room. supper is at half-past seven. we have\\ngiven up late dinner for some time now. lady tadminster, our member’s\\nwife—she was the late lord abbotsbury’s daughter—does the same. she\\nagrees with me that one must set an example of economy. we are quite a\\nwar household; nothing is wasted here—every scrap of waste paper, even,\\nis saved and sent away in sacks.”\\n\\ni expressed my appreciation, and john took me into the house and up the\\nbroad staircase, which forked right and left half-way to different\\nwings of the building. my room was in the left wing, and looked out\\nover the park.\\n\\njohn left me, and a few minutes later i saw him from my window walking\\nslowly across the grass arm in arm with cynthia murdoch. i heard mrs.\\ninglethorp call “cynthia” impatiently, and the girl started and ran\\nback to the house. at the same moment, a man stepped out from the\\nshadow of a tree and walked slowly in the same direction. he looked\\nabout forty, very dark with a melancholy clean-shaven face. some\\nviolent emotion seemed to be mastering him. he looked up at my window\\nas he passed, and i recognized him, though he had changed much in the\\nfifteen years that had elapsed since we last met. it was john’s younger\\nbrother, lawrence cavendish. i wondered what it was that had brought\\nthat singular expression to his face.\\n\\nthen i dismissed him from my mind, and returned to the contemplation of\\nmy own affairs.\\n\\nthe evening passed pleasantly enough; and i dreamed that night of that\\nenigmatical woman, mary cavendish.\\n\\nthe next morning dawned bright and sunny, and i was full of the\\nanticipation of a delightful visit.\\n\\ni did not see mrs. cavendish until lunch-time, when she volunteered to\\ntake me for a walk, and we spent a charming afternoon roaming in the\\nwoods, returning to the house about five.\\n\\nas we entered the large hall, john beckoned us both into the\\nsmoking-room. i saw at once by his face that something disturbing had\\noccurred. we followed him in, and he shut the door after us.\\n\\n“look here, mary, there’s the deuce of a mess. evie’s had a row with\\nalfred inglethorp, and she’s off.”\\n\\n“evie? off?”\\n\\njohn nodded gloomily.\\n\\n“yes; you see she went to the mater, and—oh,—here’s evie herself.”\\n\\nmiss howard entered. her lips were set grimly together, and she carried\\na small suit-case. she looked excited and determined, and slightly on\\nthe defensive.\\n\\n“at any rate,” she burst out, “i’ve spoken my mind!”\\n\\n“my dear evelyn,” cried mrs. cavendish, “this can’t be true!”\\n\\nmiss howard nodded grimly.\\n\\n“true enough! afraid i said some things to emily she won’t forget or\\nforgive in a hurry. don’t mind if they’ve only sunk in a bit. probably\\nwater off a duck’s back, though. i said right out: ‘you’re an old\\nwoman, emily, and there’s no fool like an old fool. the man’s twenty\\nyears younger than you, and don’t you fool yourself as to what he\\nmarried you for. money! well, don’t let him have too much of it. farmer\\nraikes has got a very pretty young wife. just ask your alfred how much\\ntime he spends over there.’ she was very angry. natural! i went on,\\n‘i’m going to warn you, whether you like it or not. that man would as\\nsoon murder you in your bed as look at you. he’s a bad lot. you can say\\nwhat you like to me, but remember what i’ve told you. he’s a bad lot!’”\\n\\n“what did she say?”\\n\\nmiss howard made an extremely expressive grimace.\\n\\n“‘darling alfred’—‘dearest alfred’—‘wicked calumnies’ —‘wicked\\nlies’—‘wicked woman’—to accuse her ‘dear husband!’ the sooner i left\\nher house the better. so i’m off.”\\n\\n“but not now?”\\n\\n“this minute!”\\n\\nfor a moment we sat and stared at her. finally john cavendish, finding\\nhis persuasions of no avail, went off to look up the trains. his wife\\nfollowed him, murmuring something about persuading mrs. inglethorp to\\nthink better of it.\\n\\nas she left the room, miss howard’s face changed. she leant towards me\\neagerly.\\n\\n“mr. hastings, you’re honest. i can trust you?”\\n\\ni was a little startled. she laid her hand on my arm, and sank her\\nvoice to a whisper.\\n\\n“look after her, mr. hastings. my poor emily. they’re a lot of\\nsharks—all of them. oh, i know what i’m talking about. there isn’t one\\nof them that’s not hard up and trying to get money out of her. i’ve\\nprotected her as much as i could. now i’m out of the way, they’ll\\nimpose upon her.”\\n\\n“of course, miss howard,” i said, “i’ll do everything i can, but i’m\\nsure you’re excited and overwrought.”\\n\\nshe interrupted me by slowly shaking her forefinger.\\n\\n“young man, trust me. i’ve lived in the world rather longer than you\\nhave. all i ask you is to keep your eyes open. you’ll see what i mean.”\\n\\nthe throb of the motor came through the open window, and miss howard\\nrose and moved to the door. john’s voice sounded outside. with her hand\\non the handle, she turned her head over her shoulder, and beckoned to\\nme.\\n\\n“above all, mr. hastings, watch that devil—her husband!”\\n\\nthere was no time for more. miss howard was swallowed up in an eager\\nchorus of protests and good-byes. the inglethorps did not appear.\\n\\nas the motor drove away, mrs. cavendish suddenly detached herself from\\nthe group, and moved across the drive to the lawn to meet a tall\\nbearded man who had been evidently making for the house. the colour\\nrose in her cheeks as she held out her hand to him.\\n\\n“who is that?” i asked sharply, for instinctively i distrusted the man.\\n\\n“that’s dr. bauerstein,” said john shortly.\\n\\n“and who is dr. bauerstein?”\\n\\n“he’s staying in the village doing a rest cure, after a bad nervous\\nbreakdown. he’s a london specialist; a very clever man—one of the\\ngreatest living experts on poisons, i believe.”\\n\\n“and he’s a great friend of mary’s,” put in cynthia, the irrepressible.\\n\\njohn cavendish frowned and changed the subject.\\n\\n“come for a stroll, hastings. this has been a most rotten business. she\\nalways had a rough tongue, but there is no stauncher friend in england\\nthan evelyn howard.”\\n\\nhe took the path through the plantation, and we walked down to the\\nvillage through the woods which bordered one side of the estate.\\n\\nas we passed through one of the gates on our way home again, a pretty\\nyoung woman of gipsy type coming in the opposite direction bowed and\\nsmiled.\\n\\n“that’s a pretty girl,” i remarked appreciatively.\\n\\njohn’s face hardened.\\n\\n“that is mrs. raikes.”\\n\\n“the one that miss howard——”\\n\\n“exactly,” said john, with rather unnecessary abruptness.\\n\\ni thought of the white-haired old lady in the big house, and that vivid\\nwicked little face that had just smiled into ours, and a vague chill of\\nforeboding crept over me. i brushed it aside.\\n\\n“styles is really a glorious old place,” i said to john.\\n\\nhe nodded rather gloomily.\\n\\n“yes, it’s a fine property. it’ll be mine some day—should be mine now\\nby rights, if my father had only made a decent will. and then i\\nshouldn’t be so damned hard up as i am now.”\\n\\n“hard up, are you?”\\n\\n“my dear hastings, i don’t mind telling you that i’m at my wits’ end\\nfor money.”\\n\\n“couldn’t your brother help you?”\\n\\n“lawrence? he’s gone through every penny he ever had, publishing rotten\\nverses in fancy bindings. no, we’re an impecunious lot. my mother’s\\nalways been awfully good to us, i must say. that is, up to now. since\\nher marriage, of course——” he broke off, frowning.\\n\\nfor the first time i felt that, with evelyn howard, something\\nindefinable had gone from the atmosphere. her presence had spelt\\nsecurity. now that security was removed—and the air seemed rife with\\nsuspicion. the sinister face of dr. bauerstein recurred to me\\nunpleasantly. a vague suspicion of everyone and everything filled my\\nmind. just for a moment i had a premonition of approaching evil.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter ii.\\nthe 16th and 17th of july\\n\\n\\ni had arrived at styles on the 5th of july. i come now to the events of\\nthe 16th and 17th of that month. for the convenience of the reader i\\nwill recapitulate the incidents of those days in as exact a manner as\\npossible. they were elicited subsequently at the trial by a process of\\nlong and tedious cross-examinations.\\n\\ni received a letter from evelyn howard a couple of days after her\\ndeparture, telling me she was working as a nurse at the big hospital in\\nmiddlingham, a manufacturing town some fifteen miles away, and begging\\nme to let her know if mrs. inglethorp should show any wish to be\\nreconciled.\\n\\nthe only fly in the ointment of my peaceful days was mrs. cavendish’s\\nextraordinary, and, for my part, unaccountable preference for the\\nsociety of dr. bauerstein. what she saw in the man i cannot imagine,\\nbut she was always asking him up to the house, and often went off for\\nlong expeditions with him. i must confess that i was quite unable to\\nsee his attraction.\\n\\nthe 16th of july fell on a monday. it was a day of turmoil. the famous\\nbazaar had taken place on saturday, and an entertainment, in connection\\nwith the same charity, at which mrs. inglethorp was to recite a war\\npoem, was to be held that night. we were all busy during the morning\\narranging and decorating the hall in the village where it was to take\\nplace. we had a late luncheon and spent the afternoon resting in the\\ngarden. i noticed that john’s manner was somewhat unusual. he seemed\\nvery excited and restless.\\n\\nafter tea, mrs. inglethorp went to lie down to rest before her efforts\\nin the evening and i challenged mary cavendish to a single at tennis.\\n\\nabout a quarter to seven, mrs. inglethorp called us that we should be\\nlate as supper was early that night. we had rather a scramble to get\\nready in time; and before the meal was over the motor was waiting at\\nthe door.\\n\\nthe entertainment was a great success, mrs. inglethorp’s recitation\\nreceiving tremendous applause. there were also some tableaux in which\\ncynthia took part. she did not return with us, having been asked to a\\nsupper party, and to remain the night with some friends who had been\\nacting with her in the tableaux.\\n\\nthe following morning, mrs. inglethorp stayed in bed to breakfast, as\\nshe was rather overtired; but she appeared in her briskest mood about\\n12.30, and swept lawrence and myself off to a luncheon party.\\n\\n“such a charming invitation from mrs. rolleston. lady tadminster’s\\nsister, you know. the rollestons came over with the conqueror—one of\\nour oldest families.”\\n\\nmary had excused herself on the plea of an engagement with dr.\\nbauerstein.\\n\\nwe had a pleasant luncheon, and as we drove away lawrence suggested\\nthat we should return by tadminster, which was barely a mile out of our\\nway, and pay a visit to cynthia in her dispensary. mrs. inglethorp\\nreplied that this was an excellent idea, but as she had several letters\\nto write she would drop us there, and we could come back with cynthia\\nin the pony-trap.\\n\\nwe were detained under suspicion by the hospital porter, until cynthia\\nappeared to vouch for us, looking very cool and sweet in her long white\\noverall. she took us up to her sanctum, and introduced us to her fellow\\ndispenser, a rather awe-inspiring individual, whom cynthia cheerily\\naddressed as “nibs.”\\n\\n“what a lot of bottles!” i exclaimed, as my eye travelled round the\\nsmall room. “do you really know what’s in them all?”\\n\\n“say something original,” groaned cynthia. “every single person who\\ncomes up here says that. we are really thinking of bestowing a prize on\\nthe first individual who does _not_ say: ‘what a lot of bottles!’ and i\\nknow the next thing you’re going to say is: ‘how many people have you\\npoisoned?’”\\n\\ni pleaded guilty with a laugh.\\n\\n“if you people only knew how fatally easy it is to poison someone by\\nmistake, you wouldn’t joke about it. come on, let’s have tea. we’ve got\\nall sorts of secret stores in that cupboard. no, lawrence—that’s the\\npoison cupboard. the big cupboard—that’s right.”\\n\\nwe had a very cheery tea, and assisted cynthia to wash up afterwards.\\nwe had just put away the last tea-spoon when a knock came at the door.\\nthe countenances of cynthia and nibs were suddenly petrified into a\\nstern and forbidding expression.\\n\\n“come in,” said cynthia, in a sharp professional tone.\\n\\na young and rather scared looking nurse appeared with a bottle which\\nshe proffered to nibs, who waved her towards cynthia with the somewhat\\nenigmatical remark:\\n\\n“_i_’m not really here to-day.”\\n\\ncynthia took the bottle and examined it with the severity of a judge.\\n\\n“this should have been sent up this morning.”\\n\\n“sister is very sorry. she forgot.”\\n\\n“sister should read the rules outside the door.”\\n\\ni gathered from the little nurse’s expression that there was not the\\nleast likelihood of her having the hardihood to retail this message to\\nthe dreaded “sister”.\\n\\n“so now it can’t be done until to-morrow,” finished cynthia.\\n\\n“don’t you think you could possibly let us have it to-night?”\\n\\n“well,” said cynthia graciously, “we are very busy, but if we have time\\nit shall be done.”\\n\\nthe little nurse withdrew, and cynthia promptly took a jar from the\\nshelf, refilled the bottle, and placed it on the table outside the\\ndoor.\\n\\ni laughed.\\n\\n“discipline must be maintained?”\\n\\n“exactly. come out on our little balcony. you can see all the outside\\nwards there.”\\n\\ni followed cynthia and her friend and they pointed out the different\\nwards to me. lawrence remained behind, but after a few moments cynthia\\ncalled to him over her shoulder to come and join us. then she looked at\\nher watch.\\n\\n“nothing more to do, nibs?”\\n\\n“no.”\\n\\n“all right. then we can lock up and go.”\\n\\ni had seen lawrence in quite a different light that afternoon. compared\\nto john, he was an astoundingly difficult person to get to know. he was\\nthe opposite of his brother in almost every respect, being unusually\\nshy and reserved. yet he had a certain charm of manner, and i fancied\\nthat, if one really knew him well, one could have a deep affection for\\nhim. i had always fancied that his manner to cynthia was rather\\nconstrained, and that she on her side was inclined to be shy of him.\\nbut they were both gay enough this afternoon, and chatted together like\\na couple of children.\\n\\nas we drove through the village, i remembered that i wanted some\\nstamps, so accordingly we pulled up at the post office.\\n\\nas i came out again, i cannoned into a little man who was just\\nentering. i drew aside and apologised, when suddenly, with a loud\\nexclamation, he clasped me in his arms and kissed me warmly.\\n\\n“_mon ami_ hastings!” he cried. “it is indeed _mon ami_ hastings!”\\n\\n“poirot!” i exclaimed.\\n\\ni turned to the pony-trap.\\n\\n“this is a very pleasant meeting for me, miss cynthia. this is my old\\nfriend, monsieur poirot, whom i have not seen for years.”\\n\\n“oh, we know monsieur poirot,” said cynthia gaily. “but i had no idea\\nhe was a friend of yours.”\\n\\n“yes, indeed,” said poirot seriously. “i know mademoiselle cynthia. it\\nis by the charity of that good mrs. inglethorp that i am here.” then,\\nas i looked at him inquiringly: “yes, my friend, she had kindly\\nextended hospitality to seven of my countrypeople who, alas, are\\nrefugees from their native land. we belgians will always remember her\\nwith gratitude.”\\n\\npoirot was an extraordinary looking little man. he was hardly more than\\nfive feet, four inches, but carried himself with great dignity. his\\nhead was exactly the shape of an egg, and he always perched it a little\\non one side. his moustache was very stiff and military. the neatness of\\nhis attire was almost incredible. i believe a speck of dust would have\\ncaused him more pain than a bullet wound. yet this quaint dandified\\nlittle man who, i was sorry to see, now limped badly, had been in his\\ntime one of the most celebrated members of the belgian police. as a\\ndetective, his _flair_ had been extraordinary, and he had achieved\\ntriumphs by unravelling some of the most baffling cases of the day.\\n\\nhe pointed out to me the little house inhabited by him and his fellow\\nbelgians, and i promised to go and see him at an early date. then he\\nraised his hat with a flourish to cynthia, and we drove away.\\n\\n“he’s a dear little man,” said cynthia. “i’d no idea you knew him.”\\n\\n“you’ve been entertaining a celebrity unawares,” i replied.\\n\\nand, for the rest of the way home, i recited to them the various\\nexploits and triumphs of hercule poirot.\\n\\nwe arrived back in a very cheerful mood. as we entered the hall, mrs.\\ninglethorp came out of her boudoir. she looked flushed and upset.\\n\\n“oh, it’s you,” she said.\\n\\n“is there anything the matter, aunt emily?” asked cynthia.\\n\\n“certainly not,” said mrs. inglethorp sharply. “what should there be?”\\nthen catching sight of dorcas, the parlourmaid, going into the\\ndining-room, she called to her to bring some stamps into the boudoir.\\n\\n“yes, m’m.” the old servant hesitated, then added diffidently: “don’t\\nyou think, m’m, you’d better get to bed? you’re looking very tired.”\\n\\n“perhaps you’re right, dorcas—yes—no—not now. i’ve some letters i must\\nfinish by post-time. have you lighted the fire in my room as i told\\nyou?”\\n\\n“yes, m’m.”\\n\\n“then i’ll go to bed directly after supper.”\\n\\nshe went into the boudoir again, and cynthia stared after her.\\n\\n“goodness gracious! i wonder what’s up?” she said to lawrence.\\n\\nhe did not seem to have heard her, for without a word he turned on his\\nheel and went out of the house.\\n\\ni suggested a quick game of tennis before supper and, cynthia agreeing,\\ni ran upstairs to fetch my racquet.\\n\\nmrs. cavendish was coming down the stairs. it may have been my fancy,\\nbut she, too, was looking odd and disturbed.\\n\\n“had a good walk with dr. bauerstein?” i asked, trying to appear as\\nindifferent as i could.\\n\\n“i didn’t go,” she replied abruptly. “where is mrs. inglethorp?”\\n\\n“in the boudoir.”\\n\\nher hand clenched itself on the banisters, then she seemed to nerve\\nherself for some encounter, and went rapidly past me down the stairs\\nacross the hall to the boudoir, the door of which she shut behind her.\\n\\nas i ran out to the tennis court a few moments later, i had to pass the\\nopen boudoir window, and was unable to help overhearing the following\\nscrap of dialogue. mary cavendish was saying in the voice of a woman\\ndesperately controlling herself:\\n\\n“then you won’t show it to me?”\\n\\nto which mrs. inglethorp replied:\\n\\n“my dear mary, it has nothing to do with that matter.”\\n\\n“then show it to me.”\\n\\n“i tell you it is not what you imagine. it does not concern you in the\\nleast.”\\n\\nto which mary cavendish replied, with a rising bitterness:\\n\\n“of course, i might have known you would shield him.”\\n\\ncynthia was waiting for me, and greeted me eagerly with:\\n\\n“i say! there’s been the most awful row! i’ve got it all out of\\ndorcas.”\\n\\n“what kind of a row?”\\n\\n“between aunt emily and _him_. i do hope she’s found him out at last!”\\n\\n“was dorcas there, then?”\\n\\n“of course not. she ‘happened to be near the door’. it was a real old\\nbust-up. i do wish i knew what it was all about.”\\n\\ni thought of mrs. raikes’s gipsy face, and evelyn howard’s warnings,\\nbut wisely decided to hold my peace, whilst cynthia exhausted every\\npossible hypothesis, and cheerfully hoped, “aunt emily will send him\\naway, and will never speak to him again.”\\n\\ni was anxious to get hold of john, but he was nowhere to be seen.\\nevidently something very momentous had occurred that afternoon. i tried\\nto forget the few words i had overheard; but, do what i would, i could\\nnot dismiss them altogether from my mind. what was mary cavendish’s\\nconcern in the matter?\\n\\nmr. inglethorp was in the drawing-room when i came down to supper. his\\nface was impassive as ever, and the strange unreality of the man struck\\nme afresh.\\n\\nmrs. inglethorp came down last. she still looked agitated, and during\\nthe meal there was a somewhat constrained silence. inglethorp was\\nunusually quiet. as a rule, he surrounded his wife with little\\nattentions, placing a cushion at her back, and altogether playing the\\npart of the devoted husband. immediately after supper, mrs. inglethorp\\nretired to her boudoir again.\\n\\n“send my coffee in here, mary,” she called. “i’ve just five minutes to\\ncatch the post.”\\n\\ncynthia and i went and sat by the open window in the drawing-room. mary\\ncavendish brought our coffee to us. she seemed excited.\\n\\n“do you young people want lights, or do you enjoy the twilight?” she\\nasked. “will you take mrs. inglethorp her coffee, cynthia? i will pour\\nit out.”\\n\\n“do not trouble, mary,” said inglethorp. “i will take it to emily.” he\\npoured it out, and went out of the room carrying it carefully.\\n\\nlawrence followed him, and mrs. cavendish sat down by us.\\n\\nwe three sat for some time in silence. it was a glorious night, hot and\\nstill. mrs. cavendish fanned herself gently with a palm leaf.\\n\\n“it’s almost too hot,” she murmured. “we shall have a thunderstorm.”\\n\\nalas, that these harmonious moments can never endure! my paradise was\\nrudely shattered by the sound of a well known, and heartily disliked,\\nvoice in the hall.\\n\\n“dr. bauerstein!” exclaimed cynthia. “what a funny time to come.”\\n\\ni glanced jealously at mary cavendish, but she seemed quite\\nundisturbed, the delicate pallor of her cheeks did not vary.\\n\\nin a few moments, alfred inglethorp had ushered the doctor in, the\\nlatter laughing, and protesting that he was in no fit state for a\\ndrawing-room. in truth, he presented a sorry spectacle, being literally\\nplastered with mud.\\n\\n“what have you been doing, doctor?” cried mrs. cavendish.\\n\\n“i must make my apologies,” said the doctor. “i did not really mean to\\ncome in, but mr. inglethorp insisted.”\\n\\n“well, bauerstein, you are in a plight,” said john, strolling in from\\nthe hall. “have some coffee, and tell us what you have been up to.”\\n\\n“thank you, i will.” he laughed rather ruefully, as he described how he\\nhad discovered a very rare species of fern in an inaccessible place,\\nand in his efforts to obtain it had lost his footing, and slipped\\nignominiously into a neighbouring pond.\\n\\n“the sun soon dried me off,” he added, “but i’m afraid my appearance is\\nvery disreputable.”\\n\\nat this juncture, mrs. inglethorp called to cynthia from the hall, and\\nthe girl ran out.\\n\\n“just carry up my despatch-case, will you, dear? i’m going to bed.”\\n\\nthe door into the hall was a wide one. i had risen when cynthia did,\\njohn was close by me. there were therefore three witnesses who could\\nswear that mrs. inglethorp was carrying her coffee, as yet untasted, in\\nher hand.\\n\\nmy evening was utterly and entirely spoilt by the presence of dr.\\nbauerstein. it seemed to me the man would never go. he rose at last,\\nhowever, and i breathed a sigh of relief.\\n\\n“i’ll walk down to the village with you,” said mr. inglethorp. “i must\\nsee our agent over those estate accounts.” he turned to john. “no one\\nneed sit up. i will take the latch-key.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter iii.\\nthe night of the tragedy\\n\\n\\nto make this part of my story clear, i append the following plan of the\\nfirst floor of styles. the servants’ rooms are reached through the door\\nb. they have no communication with the right wing, where the\\ninglethorps’ rooms were situated.\\n\\n[illustration]\\n\\nit seemed to be the middle of the night when i was awakened by lawrence\\ncavendish. he had a candle in his hand, and the agitation of his face\\ntold me at once that something was seriously wrong.\\n\\n“what’s the matter?” i asked, sitting up in bed, and trying to collect\\nmy scattered thoughts.\\n\\n“we are afraid my mother is very ill. she seems to be having some kind\\nof fit. unfortunately she has locked herself in.”\\n\\n“i’ll come at once.”\\n\\ni sprang out of bed; and, pulling on a dressing-gown, followed lawrence\\nalong the passage and the gallery to the right wing of the house.\\n\\njohn cavendish joined us, and one or two of the servants were standing\\nround in a state of awe-stricken excitement. lawrence turned to his\\nbrother.\\n\\n“what do you think we had better do?”\\n\\nnever, i thought, had his indecision of character been more apparent.\\n\\njohn rattled the handle of mrs. inglethorp’s door violently, but with\\nno effect. it was obviously locked or bolted on the inside. the whole\\nhousehold was aroused by now. the most alarming sounds were audible\\nfrom the interior of the room. clearly something must be done.\\n\\n“try going through mr. inglethorp’s room, sir,” cried dorcas. “oh, the\\npoor mistress!”\\n\\nsuddenly i realized that alfred inglethorp was not with us—that he\\nalone had given no sign of his presence. john opened the door of his\\nroom. it was pitch dark, but lawrence was following with the candle,\\nand by its feeble light we saw that the bed had not been slept in, and\\nthat there was no sign of the room having been occupied.\\n\\nwe went straight to the connecting door. that, too, was locked or\\nbolted on the inside. what was to be done?\\n\\n“oh, dear, sir,” cried dorcas, wringing her hands, “what ever shall we\\ndo?”\\n\\n“we must try and break the door in, i suppose. it’ll be a tough job,\\nthough. here, let one of the maids go down and wake baily and tell him\\nto go for dr. wilkins at once. now then, we’ll have a try at the door.\\nhalf a moment, though, isn’t there a door into miss cynthia’s rooms?”\\n\\n“yes, sir, but that’s always bolted. it’s never been undone.”\\n\\n“well, we might just see.”\\n\\nhe ran rapidly down the corridor to cynthia’s room. mary cavendish was\\nthere, shaking the girl—who must have been an unusually sound\\nsleeper—and trying to wake her.\\n\\nin a moment or two he was back.\\n\\n“no good. that’s bolted too. we must break in the door. i think this\\none is a shade less solid than the one in the passage.”\\n\\nwe strained and heaved together. the framework of the door was solid,\\nand for a long time it resisted our efforts, but at last we felt it\\ngive beneath our weight, and finally, with a resounding crash, it was\\nburst open.\\n\\nwe stumbled in together, lawrence still holding his candle. mrs.\\ninglethorp was lying on the bed, her whole form agitated by violent\\nconvulsions, in one of which she must have overturned the table beside\\nher. as we entered, however, her limbs relaxed, and she fell back upon\\nthe pillows.\\n\\njohn strode across the room, and lit the gas. turning to annie, one of\\nthe housemaids, he sent her downstairs to the dining-room for brandy.\\nthen he went across to his mother whilst i unbolted the door that gave\\non the corridor.\\n\\ni turned to lawrence, to suggest that i had better leave them now that\\nthere was no further need of my services, but the words were frozen on\\nmy lips. never have i seen such a ghastly look on any man’s face. he\\nwas white as chalk, the candle he held in his shaking hand was\\nsputtering onto the carpet, and his eyes, petrified with terror, or\\nsome such kindred emotion, stared fixedly over my head at a point on\\nthe further wall. it was as though he had seen something that turned\\nhim to stone. i instinctively followed the direction of his eyes, but i\\ncould see nothing unusual. the still feebly flickering ashes in the\\ngrate, and the row of prim ornaments on the mantelpiece, were surely\\nharmless enough.\\n\\nthe violence of mrs. inglethorp’s attack seemed to be passing. she was\\nable to speak in short gasps.\\n\\n“better now—very sudden—stupid of me—to lock myself in.”\\n\\na shadow fell on the bed and, looking up, i saw mary cavendish standing\\nnear the door with her arm around cynthia. she seemed to be supporting\\nthe girl, who looked utterly dazed and unlike herself. her face was\\nheavily flushed, and she yawned repeatedly.\\n\\n“poor cynthia is quite frightened,” said mrs. cavendish in a low clear\\nvoice. she herself, i noticed, was dressed in her white land smock.\\nthen it must be later than i thought. i saw that a faint streak of\\ndaylight was showing through the curtains of the windows, and that the\\nclock on the mantelpiece pointed to close upon five o’clock.\\n\\na strangled cry from the bed startled me. a fresh access of pain seized\\nthe unfortunate old lady. the convulsions were of a violence terrible\\nto behold. everything was confusion. we thronged round her, powerless\\nto help or alleviate. a final convulsion lifted her from the bed, until\\nshe appeared to rest upon her head and her heels, with her body arched\\nin an extraordinary manner. in vain mary and john tried to administer\\nmore brandy. the moments flew. again the body arched itself in that\\npeculiar fashion.\\n\\nat that moment, dr. bauerstein pushed his way authoritatively into the\\nroom. for one instant he stopped dead, staring at the figure on the\\nbed, and, at the same instant, mrs. inglethorp cried out in a strangled\\nvoice, her eyes fixed on the doctor:\\n\\n“alfred—alfred——” then she fell back motionless on the pillows.\\n\\nwith a stride, the doctor reached the bed, and seizing her arms worked\\nthem energetically, applying what i knew to be artificial respiration.\\nhe issued a few short sharp orders to the servants. an imperious wave\\nof his hand drove us all to the door. we watched him, fascinated,\\nthough i think we all knew in our hearts that it was too late, and that\\nnothing could be done now. i could see by the expression on his face\\nthat he himself had little hope.\\n\\nfinally he abandoned his task, shaking his head gravely. at that\\nmoment, we heard footsteps outside, and dr. wilkins, mrs. inglethorp’s\\nown doctor, a portly, fussy little man, came bustling in.\\n\\nin a few words dr. bauerstein explained how he had happened to be\\npassing the lodge gates as the car came out, and had run up to the\\nhouse as fast as he could, whilst the car went on to fetch dr. wilkins.\\nwith a faint gesture of the hand, he indicated the figure on the bed.\\n\\n“ve—ry sad. ve—ry sad,” murmured dr. wilkins. “poor dear lady. always\\ndid far too much—far too much—against my advice. i warned her. her\\nheart was far from strong. ‘take it easy,’ i said to her,\\n‘take—it—easy’. but no—her zeal for good works was too great. nature\\nrebelled. na—ture—re—belled.”\\n\\ndr. bauerstein, i noticed, was watching the local doctor narrowly. he\\nstill kept his eyes fixed on him as he spoke.\\n\\n“the convulsions were of a peculiar violence, dr. wilkins. i am sorry\\nyou were not here in time to witness them. they were quite—tetanic in\\ncharacter.”\\n\\n“ah!” said dr. wilkins wisely.\\n\\n“i should like to speak to you in private,” said dr. bauerstein. he\\nturned to john. “you do not object?”\\n\\n“certainly not.”\\n\\nwe all trooped out into the corridor, leaving the two doctors alone,\\nand i heard the key turned in the lock behind us.\\n\\nwe went slowly down the stairs. i was violently excited. i have a\\ncertain talent for deduction, and dr. bauerstein’s manner had started a\\nflock of wild surmises in my mind. mary cavendish laid her hand upon my\\narm.\\n\\n“what is it? why did dr. bauerstein seem so—peculiar?”\\n\\ni looked at her.\\n\\n“do you know what i think?”\\n\\n“what?”\\n\\n“listen!” i looked round, the others were out of earshot. i lowered my\\nvoice to a whisper. “i believe she has been poisoned! i’m certain dr.\\nbauerstein suspects it.”\\n\\n“_what?_” she shrank against the wall, the pupils of her eyes dilating\\nwildly. then, with a sudden cry that startled me, she cried out: “no,\\nno—not that—not that!” and breaking from me, fled up the stairs. i\\nfollowed her, afraid that she was going to faint. i found her leaning\\nagainst the bannisters, deadly pale. she waved me away impatiently.\\n\\n“no, no—leave me. i’d rather be alone. let me just be quiet for a\\nminute or two. go down to the others.”\\n\\ni obeyed her reluctantly. john and lawrence were in the dining-room. i\\njoined them. we were all silent, but i suppose i voiced the thoughts of\\nus all when i at last broke it by saying:\\n\\n“where is mr. inglethorp?”\\n\\njohn shook his head.\\n\\n“he’s not in the house.”\\n\\nour eyes met. where _was_ alfred inglethorp? his absence was strange\\nand inexplicable. i remembered mrs. inglethorp’s dying words. what lay\\nbeneath them? what more could she have told us, if she had had time?\\n\\nat last we heard the doctors descending the stairs. dr. wilkins was\\nlooking important and excited, and trying to conceal an inward\\nexultation under a manner of decorous calm. dr. bauerstein remained in\\nthe background, his grave bearded face unchanged. dr. wilkins was the\\nspokesman for the two. he addressed himself to john:\\n\\n“mr. cavendish, i should like your consent to a post-mortem.”\\n\\n“is that necessary?” asked john gravely. a spasm of pain crossed his\\nface.\\n\\n“absolutely,” said dr. bauerstein.\\n\\n“you mean by that——?”\\n\\n“that neither dr. wilkins nor myself could give a death certificate\\nunder the circumstances.”\\n\\njohn bent his head.\\n\\n“in that case, i have no alternative but to agree.”\\n\\n“thank you,” said dr. wilkins briskly. “we propose that it should take\\nplace to-morrow night—or rather to-night.” and he glanced at the\\ndaylight. “under the circumstances, i am afraid an inquest can hardly\\nbe avoided—these formalities are necessary, but i beg that you won’t\\ndistress yourselves.”\\n\\nthere was a pause, and then dr. bauerstein drew two keys from his\\npocket, and handed them to john.\\n\\n“these are the keys of the two rooms. i have locked them and, in my\\nopinion, they would be better kept locked for the present.”\\n\\nthe doctors then departed.\\n\\ni had been turning over an idea in my head, and i felt that the moment\\nhad now come to broach it. yet i was a little chary of doing so. john,\\ni knew, had a horror of any kind of publicity, and was an easygoing\\noptimist, who preferred never to meet trouble half-way. it might be\\ndifficult to convince him of the soundness of my plan. lawrence, on the\\nother hand, being less conventional, and having more imagination, i\\nfelt i might count upon as an ally. there was no doubt that the moment\\nhad come for me to take the lead.\\n\\n“john,” i said, “i am going to ask you something.”\\n\\n“well?”\\n\\n“you remember my speaking of my friend poirot? the belgian who is here?\\nhe has been a most famous detective.”\\n\\n“yes.”\\n\\n“i want you to let me call him in—to investigate this matter.”\\n\\n“what—now? before the post-mortem?”\\n\\n“yes, time is an advantage if—if—there has been foul play.”\\n\\n“rubbish!” cried lawrence angrily. “in my opinion the whole thing is a\\nmare’s nest of bauerstein’s! wilkins hadn’t an idea of such a thing,\\nuntil bauerstein put it into his head. but, like all specialists,\\nbauerstein’s got a bee in his bonnet. poisons are his hobby, so of\\ncourse he sees them everywhere.”\\n\\ni confess that i was surprised by lawrence’s attitude. he was so seldom\\nvehement about anything.\\n\\njohn hesitated.\\n\\n“i can’t feel as you do, lawrence,” he said at last. “i’m inclined to\\ngive hastings a free hand, though i should prefer to wait a bit. we\\ndon’t want any unnecessary scandal.”\\n\\n“no, no,” i cried eagerly, “you need have no fear of that. poirot is\\ndiscretion itself.”\\n\\n“very well, then, have it your own way. i leave it in your hands.\\nthough, if it is as we suspect, it seems a clear enough case. god\\nforgive me if i am wronging him!”\\n\\ni looked at my watch. it was six o’clock. i determined to lose no time.\\n\\nfive minutes’ delay, however, i allowed myself. i spent it in\\nransacking the library until i discovered a medical book which gave a\\ndescription of strychnine poisoning.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter iv.\\npoirot investigates\\n\\n\\nthe house which the belgians occupied in the village was quite close to\\nthe park gates. one could save time by taking a narrow path through the\\nlong grass, which cut off the detours of the winding drive. so i,\\naccordingly, went that way. i had nearly reached the lodge, when my\\nattention was arrested by the running figure of a man approaching me.\\nit was mr. inglethorp. where had he been? how did he intend to explain\\nhis absence?\\n\\nhe accosted me eagerly.\\n\\n“my god! this is terrible! my poor wife! i have only just heard.”\\n\\n“where have you been?” i asked.\\n\\n“denby kept me late last night. it was one o’clock before we’d\\nfinished. then i found that i’d forgotten the latch-key after all. i\\ndidn’t want to arouse the household, so denby gave me a bed.”\\n\\n“how did you hear the news?” i asked.\\n\\n“wilkins knocked denby up to tell him. my poor emily! she was so\\nself-sacrificing—such a noble character. she over-taxed her strength.”\\n\\na wave of revulsion swept over me. what a consummate hypocrite the man\\nwas!\\n\\n“i must hurry on,” i said, thankful that he did not ask me whither i\\nwas bound.\\n\\nin a few minutes i was knocking at the door of leastways cottage.\\n\\ngetting no answer, i repeated my summons impatiently. a window above me\\nwas cautiously opened, and poirot himself looked out.\\n\\nhe gave an exclamation of surprise at seeing me. in a few brief words,\\ni explained the tragedy that had occurred, and that i wanted his help.\\n\\n“wait, my friend, i will let you in, and you shall recount to me the\\naffair whilst i dress.”\\n\\nin a few moments he had unbarred the door, and i followed him up to his\\nroom. there he installed me in a chair, and i related the whole story,\\nkeeping back nothing, and omitting no circumstance, however\\ninsignificant, whilst he himself made a careful and deliberate toilet.\\n\\ni told him of my awakening, of mrs. inglethorp’s dying words, of her\\nhusband’s absence, of the quarrel the day before, of the scrap of\\nconversation between mary and her mother-in-law that i had overheard,\\nof the former quarrel between mrs. inglethorp and evelyn howard, and of\\nthe latter’s innuendoes.\\n\\ni was hardly as clear as i could wish. i repeated myself several times,\\nand occasionally had to go back to some detail that i had forgotten.\\npoirot smiled kindly on me.\\n\\n“the mind is confused? is it not so? take time, _mon ami_. you are\\nagitated; you are excited—it is but natural. presently, when we are\\ncalmer, we will arrange the facts, neatly, each in his proper place. we\\nwill examine—and reject. those of importance we will put on one side;\\nthose of no importance, pouf!”—he screwed up his cherub-like face, and\\npuffed comically enough—“blow them away!”\\n\\n“that’s all very well,” i objected, “but how are you going to decide\\nwhat is important, and what isn’t? that always seems the difficulty to\\nme.”\\n\\npoirot shook his head energetically. he was now arranging his moustache\\nwith exquisite care.\\n\\n“not so. _voyons!_ one fact leads to another—so we continue. does the\\nnext fit in with that? _a merveille!_ good! we can proceed. this next\\nlittle fact—no! ah, that is curious! there is something missing—a link\\nin the chain that is not there. we examine. we search. and that little\\ncurious fact, that possibly paltry little detail that will not tally,\\nwe put it here!” he made an extravagant gesture with his hand. “it is\\nsignificant! it is tremendous!”\\n\\n“y—es——”\\n\\n“ah!” poirot shook his forefinger so fiercely at me that i quailed\\nbefore it. “beware! peril to the detective who says: ‘it is so small—it\\ndoes not matter. it will not agree. i will forget it.’ that way lies\\nconfusion! everything matters.”\\n\\n“i know. you always told me that. that’s why i have gone into all the\\ndetails of this thing whether they seemed to me relevant or not.”\\n\\n“and i am pleased with you. you have a good memory, and you have given\\nme the facts faithfully. of the order in which you present them, i say\\nnothing—truly, it is deplorable! but i make allowances—you are upset.\\nto that i attribute the circumstance that you have omitted one fact of\\nparamount importance.”\\n\\n“what is that?” i asked.\\n\\n“you have not told me if mrs. inglethorp ate well last night.”\\n\\ni stared at him. surely the war had affected the little man’s brain. he\\nwas carefully engaged in brushing his coat before putting it on, and\\nseemed wholly engrossed in the task.\\n\\n“i don’t remember,” i said. “and, anyway, i don’t see——”\\n\\n“you do not see? but it is of the first importance.”\\n\\n“i can’t see why,” i said, rather nettled. “as far as i can remember,\\nshe didn’t eat much. she was obviously upset, and it had taken her\\nappetite away. that was only natural.”\\n\\n“yes,” said poirot thoughtfully, “it was only natural.”\\n\\nhe opened a drawer, and took out a small despatch-case, then turned to\\nme.\\n\\n“now i am ready. we will proceed to the château, and study matters on\\nthe spot. excuse me, _mon ami_, you dressed in haste, and your tie is\\non one side. permit me.” with a deft gesture, he rearranged it.\\n\\n“_ça y est!_ now, shall we start?”\\n\\nwe hurried up the village, and turned in at the lodge gates. poirot\\nstopped for a moment, and gazed sorrowfully over the beautiful expanse\\nof park, still glittering with morning dew.\\n\\n“so beautiful, so beautiful, and yet, the poor family, plunged in\\nsorrow, prostrated with grief.”\\n\\nhe looked at me keenly as he spoke, and i was aware that i reddened\\nunder his prolonged gaze.\\n\\nwas the family prostrated by grief? was the sorrow at mrs. inglethorp’s\\ndeath so great? i realized that there was an emotional lack in the\\natmosphere. the dead woman had not the gift of commanding love. her\\ndeath was a shock and a distress, but she would not be passionately\\nregretted.\\n\\npoirot seemed to follow my thoughts. he nodded his head gravely.\\n\\n“no, you are right,” he said, “it is not as though there was a blood\\ntie. she has been kind and generous to these cavendishes, but she was\\nnot their own mother. blood tells—always remember that—blood tells.”\\n\\n“poirot,” i said, “i wish you would tell me why you wanted to know if\\nmrs. inglethorp ate well last night? i have been turning it over in my\\nmind, but i can’t see how it has anything to do with the matter?”\\n\\nhe was silent for a minute or two as we walked along, but finally he\\nsaid:\\n\\n“i do not mind telling you—though, as you know, it is not my habit to\\nexplain until the end is reached. the present contention is that mrs.\\ninglethorp died of strychnine poisoning, presumably administered in her\\ncoffee.”\\n\\n“yes?”\\n\\n“well, what time was the coffee served?”\\n\\n“about eight o’clock.”\\n\\n“therefore she drank it between then and half-past eight—certainly not\\nmuch later. well, strychnine is a fairly rapid poison. its effects\\nwould be felt very soon, probably in about an hour. yet, in mrs.\\ninglethorp’s case, the symptoms do not manifest themselves until five\\no’clock the next morning: nine hours! but a heavy meal, taken at about\\nthe same time as the poison, might retard its effects, though hardly to\\nthat extent. still, it is a possibility to be taken into account. but,\\naccording to you, she ate very little for supper, and yet the symptoms\\ndo not develop until early the next morning! now that is a curious\\ncircumstance, my friend. something may arise at the autopsy to explain\\nit. in the meantime, remember it.”\\n\\nas we neared the house, john came out and met us. his face looked weary\\nand haggard.\\n\\n“this is a very dreadful business, monsieur poirot,” he said. “hastings\\nhas explained to you that we are anxious for no publicity?”\\n\\n“i comprehend perfectly.”\\n\\n“you see, it is only suspicion so far. we have nothing to go upon.”\\n\\n“precisely. it is a matter of precaution only.”\\n\\njohn turned to me, taking out his cigarette-case, and lighting a\\ncigarette as he did so.\\n\\n“you know that fellow inglethorp is back?”\\n\\n“yes. i met him.”\\n\\njohn flung the match into an adjacent flower bed, a proceeding which\\nwas too much for poirot’s feelings. he retrieved it, and buried it\\nneatly.\\n\\n“it’s jolly difficult to know how to treat him.”\\n\\n“that difficulty will not exist long,” pronounced poirot quietly.\\n\\njohn looked puzzled, not quite understanding the portent of this\\ncryptic saying. he handed the two keys which dr. bauerstein had given\\nhim to me.\\n\\n“show monsieur poirot everything he wants to see.”\\n\\n“the rooms are locked?” asked poirot.\\n\\n“dr. bauerstein considered it advisable.”\\n\\npoirot nodded thoughtfully.\\n\\n“then he is very sure. well, that simplifies matters for us.”\\n\\nwe went up together to the room of the tragedy. for convenience i\\nappend a plan of the room and the principal articles of furniture in\\nit.\\n\\n[illustration]\\n\\npoirot locked the door on the inside, and proceeded to a minute\\ninspection of the room. he darted from one object to the other with the\\nagility of a grasshopper. i remained by the door, fearing to obliterate\\nany clues. poirot, however, did not seem grateful to me for my\\nforbearance.\\n\\n“what have you, my friend,” he cried, “that you remain there like—how\\ndo you say it?—ah, yes, the stuck pig?”\\n\\ni explained that i was afraid of obliterating any foot-marks.\\n\\n“foot-marks? but what an idea! there has already been practically an\\narmy in the room! what foot-marks are we likely to find? no, come here\\nand aid me in my search. i will put down my little case until i need\\nit.”\\n\\nhe did so, on the round table by the window, but it was an ill-advised\\nproceeding; for, the top of it being loose, it tilted up, and\\nprecipitated the despatch-case on the floor.\\n\\n“_eh voilà une table!_” cried poirot. “ah, my friend, one may live in a\\nbig house and yet have no comfort.”\\n\\nafter which piece of moralizing, he resumed his search.\\n\\na small purple despatch-case, with a key in the lock, on the\\nwriting-table, engaged his attention for some time. he took out the key\\nfrom the lock, and passed it to me to inspect. i saw nothing peculiar,\\nhowever. it was an ordinary key of the yale type, with a bit of twisted\\nwire through the handle.\\n\\nnext, he examined the framework of the door we had broken in, assuring\\nhimself that the bolt had really been shot. then he went to the door\\nopposite leading into cynthia’s room. that door was also bolted, as i\\nhad stated. however, he went to the length of unbolting it, and opening\\nand shutting it several times; this he did with the utmost precaution\\nagainst making any noise. suddenly something in the bolt itself seemed\\nto rivet his attention. he examined it carefully, and then, nimbly\\nwhipping out a pair of small forceps from his case, he drew out some\\nminute particle which he carefully sealed up in a tiny envelope.\\n\\non the chest of drawers there was a tray with a spirit lamp and a small\\nsaucepan on it. a small quantity of a dark fluid remained in the\\nsaucepan, and an empty cup and saucer that had been drunk out of stood\\nnear it.\\n\\ni wondered how i could have been so unobservant as to overlook this.\\nhere was a clue worth having. poirot delicately dipped his finger into\\nliquid, and tasted it gingerly. he made a grimace.\\n\\n“cocoa—with—i think—rum in it.”\\n\\nhe passed on to the debris on the floor, where the table by the bed had\\nbeen overturned. a reading-lamp, some books, matches, a bunch of keys,\\nand the crushed fragments of a coffee-cup lay scattered about.\\n\\n“ah, this is curious,” said poirot.\\n\\n“i must confess that i see nothing particularly curious about it.”\\n\\n“you do not? observe the lamp—the chimney is broken in two places; they\\nlie there as they fell. but see, the coffee-cup is absolutely smashed\\nto powder.”\\n\\n“well,” i said wearily, “i suppose someone must have stepped on it.”\\n\\n“exactly,” said poirot, in an odd voice. “someone stepped on it.”\\n\\nhe rose from his knees, and walked slowly across to the mantelpiece,\\nwhere he stood abstractedly fingering the ornaments, and straightening\\nthem—a trick of his when he was agitated.\\n\\n“_mon ami_,” he said, turning to me, “somebody stepped on that cup,\\ngrinding it to powder, and the reason they did so was either because it\\ncontained strychnine or—which is far more serious—because it did not\\ncontain strychnine!”\\n\\ni made no reply. i was bewildered, but i knew that it was no good\\nasking him to explain. in a moment or two he roused himself, and went\\non with his investigations. he picked up the bunch of keys from the\\nfloor, and twirling them round in his fingers finally selected one,\\nvery bright and shining, which he tried in the lock of the purple\\ndespatch-case. it fitted, and he opened the box, but after a moment’s\\nhesitation, closed and relocked it, and slipped the bunch of keys, as\\nwell as the key that had originally stood in the lock, into his own\\npocket.\\n\\n“i have no authority to go through these papers. but it should be\\ndone—at once!”\\n\\nhe then made a very careful examination of the drawers of the\\nwash-stand. crossing the room to the left-hand window, a round stain,\\nhardly visible on the dark brown carpet, seemed to interest him\\nparticularly. he went down on his knees, examining it minutely—even\\ngoing so far as to smell it.\\n\\nfinally, he poured a few drops of the cocoa into a test tube, sealing\\nit up carefully. his next proceeding was to take out a little notebook.\\n\\n“we have found in this room,” he said, writing busily, “six points of\\ninterest. shall i enumerate them, or will you?”\\n\\n“oh, you,” i replied hastily.\\n\\n“very well, then. one, a coffee-cup that has been ground into powder;\\ntwo, a despatch-case with a key in the lock; three, a stain on the\\nfloor.”\\n\\n“that may have been done some time ago,” i interrupted.\\n\\n“no, for it is still perceptibly damp and smells of coffee. four, a\\nfragment of some dark green fabric—only a thread or two, but\\nrecognizable.”\\n\\n“ah!” i cried. “that was what you sealed up in the envelope.”\\n\\n“yes. it may turn out to be a piece of one of mrs. inglethorp’s own\\ndresses, and quite unimportant. we shall see. five, _this_!” with a\\ndramatic gesture, he pointed to a large splash of candle grease on the\\nfloor by the writing-table. “it must have been done since yesterday,\\notherwise a good housemaid would have at once removed it with\\nblotting-paper and a hot iron. one of my best hats once—but that is not\\nto the point.”\\n\\n“it was very likely done last night. we were very agitated. or perhaps\\nmrs. inglethorp herself dropped her candle.”\\n\\n“you brought only one candle into the room?”\\n\\n“yes. lawrence cavendish was carrying it. but he was very upset. he\\nseemed to see something over here”—i indicated the mantelpiece—“that\\nabsolutely paralysed him.”\\n\\n“that is interesting,” said poirot quickly. “yes, it is suggestive”—his\\neye sweeping the whole length of the wall—“but it was not his candle\\nthat made this great patch, for you perceive that this is white grease;\\nwhereas monsieur lawrence’s candle, which is still on the\\ndressing-table, is pink. on the other hand, mrs. inglethorp had no\\ncandlestick in the room, only a reading-lamp.”\\n\\n“then,” i said, “what do you deduce?”\\n\\nto which my friend only made a rather irritating reply, urging me to\\nuse my own natural faculties.\\n\\n“and the sixth point?” i asked. “i suppose it is the sample of cocoa.”\\n\\n“no,” said poirot thoughtfully. “i might have included that in the six,\\nbut i did not. no, the sixth point i will keep to myself for the\\npresent.”\\n\\nhe looked quickly round the room. “there is nothing more to be done\\nhere, i think, unless”—he stared earnestly and long at the dead ashes\\nin the grate. “the fire burns—and it destroys. but by chance—there\\nmight be—let us see!”\\n\\ndeftly, on hands and knees, he began to sort the ashes from the grate\\ninto the fender, handling them with the greatest caution. suddenly, he\\ngave a faint exclamation.\\n\\n“the forceps, hastings!”\\n\\ni quickly handed them to him, and with skill he extracted a small piece\\nof half charred paper.\\n\\n“there, _mon ami!_” he cried. “what do you think of that?”\\n\\ni scrutinized the fragment. this is an exact reproduction of it:—\\n\\n[illustration]\\n\\ni was puzzled. it was unusually thick, quite unlike ordinary notepaper.\\nsuddenly an idea struck me.\\n\\n“poirot!” i cried. “this is a fragment of a will!”\\n\\n“exactly.”\\n\\ni looked up at him sharply.\\n\\n“you are not surprised?”\\n\\n“no,” he said gravely, “i expected it.”\\n\\ni relinquished the piece of paper, and watched him put it away in his\\ncase, with the same methodical care that he bestowed on everything. my\\nbrain was in a whirl. what was this complication of a will? who had\\ndestroyed it? the person who had left the candle grease on the floor?\\nobviously. but how had anyone gained admission? all the doors had been\\nbolted on the inside.\\n\\n“now, my friend,” said poirot briskly, “we will go. i should like to\\nask a few questions of the parlourmaid—dorcas, her name is, is it not?”\\n\\nwe passed through alfred inglethorp’s room, and poirot delayed long\\nenough to make a brief but fairly comprehensive examination of it. we\\nwent out through that door, locking both it and that of mrs.\\ninglethorp’s room as before.\\n\\ni took him down to the boudoir which he had expressed a wish to see,\\nand went myself in search of dorcas.\\n\\nwhen i returned with her, however, the boudoir was empty.\\n\\n“poirot,” i cried, “where are you?”\\n\\n“i am here, my friend.”\\n\\nhe had stepped outside the french window, and was standing, apparently\\nlost in admiration, before the various shaped flower beds.\\n\\n“admirable!” he murmured. “admirable! what symmetry! observe that\\ncrescent; and those diamonds—their neatness rejoices the eye. the\\nspacing of the plants, also, is perfect. it has been recently done; is\\nit not so?”\\n\\n“yes, i believe they were at it yesterday afternoon. but come in—dorcas\\nis here.”\\n\\n“_eh bien, eh bien!_ do not grudge me a moment’s satisfaction of the\\neye.”\\n\\n“yes, but this affair is more important.”\\n\\n“and how do you know that these fine begonias are not of equal\\nimportance?”\\n\\ni shrugged my shoulders. there was really no arguing with him if he\\nchose to take that line.\\n\\n“you do not agree? but such things have been. well, we will come in and\\ninterview the brave dorcas.”\\n\\ndorcas was standing in the boudoir, her hands folded in front of her,\\nand her grey hair rose in stiff waves under her white cap. she was the\\nvery model and picture of a good old-fashioned servant.\\n\\nin her attitude towards poirot, she was inclined to be suspicious, but\\nhe soon broke down her defences. he drew forward a chair.\\n\\n“pray be seated, mademoiselle.”\\n\\n“thank you, sir.”\\n\\n“you have been with your mistress many years, is it not so?”\\n\\n“ten years, sir.”\\n\\n“that is a long time, and very faithful service. you were much attached\\nto her, were you not?”\\n\\n“she was a very good mistress to me, sir.”\\n\\n“then you will not object to answering a few questions. i put them to\\nyou with mr. cavendish’s full approval.”\\n\\n“oh, certainly, sir.”\\n\\n“then i will begin by asking you about the events of yesterday\\nafternoon. your mistress had a quarrel?”\\n\\n“yes, sir. but i don’t know that i ought——” dorcas hesitated.\\n\\npoirot looked at her keenly.\\n\\n“my good dorcas, it is necessary that i should know every detail of\\nthat quarrel as fully as possible. do not think that you are betraying\\nyour mistress’s secrets. your mistress lies dead, and it is necessary\\nthat we should know all—if we are to avenge her. nothing can bring her\\nback to life, but we do hope, if there has been foul play, to bring the\\nmurderer to justice.”\\n\\n“amen to that,” said dorcas fiercely. “and, naming no names, there’s\\n_one_ in this house that none of us could ever abide! and an ill day it\\nwas when first _he_ darkened the threshold.”\\n\\npoirot waited for her indignation to subside, and then, resuming his\\nbusiness-like tone, he asked:\\n\\n“now, as to this quarrel? what is the first you heard of it?”\\n\\n“well, sir, i happened to be going along the hall outside yesterday——”\\n\\n“what time was that?”\\n\\n“i couldn’t say exactly, sir, but it wasn’t tea-time by a long way.\\nperhaps four o’clock—or it may have been a bit later. well, sir, as i\\nsaid, i happened to be passing along, when i heard voices very loud and\\nangry in here. i didn’t exactly mean to listen, but—well, there it is.\\ni stopped. the door was shut, but the mistress was speaking very sharp\\nand clear, and i heard what she said quite plainly. ‘you have lied to\\nme, and deceived me,’ she said. i didn’t hear what mr. inglethorp\\nreplied. he spoke a good bit lower than she did—but she answered: ‘how\\ndare you? i have kept you and clothed you and fed you! you owe\\neverything to me! and this is how you repay me! by bringing disgrace\\nupon our name!’ again i didn’t hear what he said, but she went on:\\n‘nothing that you can say will make any difference. i see my duty\\nclearly. my mind is made up. you need not think that any fear of\\npublicity, or scandal between husband and wife will deter me.’ then i\\nthought i heard them coming out, so i went off quickly.”\\n\\n“you are sure it was mr. inglethorp’s voice you heard?”\\n\\n“oh, yes, sir, whose else’s could it be?”\\n\\n“well, what happened next?”\\n\\n“later, i came back to the hall; but it was all quiet. at five o’clock,\\nmrs. inglethorp rang the bell and told me to bring her a cup of\\ntea—nothing to eat—to the boudoir. she was looking dreadful—so white\\nand upset. ‘dorcas,’ she says, ‘i’ve had a great shock.’ ‘i’m sorry for\\nthat, m’m,’ i says. ‘you’ll feel better after a nice hot cup of tea,\\nm’m.’ she had something in her hand. i don’t know if it was a letter,\\nor just a piece of paper, but it had writing on it, and she kept\\nstaring at it, almost as if she couldn’t believe what was written\\nthere. she whispered to herself, as though she had forgotten i was\\nthere: ‘these few words—and everything’s changed.’ and then she says to\\nme: ‘never trust a man, dorcas, they’re not worth it!’ i hurried off,\\nand got her a good strong cup of tea, and she thanked me, and said\\nshe’d feel better when she’d drunk it. ‘i don’t know what to do,’ she\\nsays. ‘scandal between husband and wife is a dreadful thing, dorcas.\\ni’d rather hush it up if i could.’ mrs. cavendish came in just then, so\\nshe didn’t say any more.”\\n\\n“she still had the letter, or whatever it was, in her hand?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“yes, sir.”\\n\\n“what would she be likely to do with it afterwards?”\\n\\n“well, i don’t know, sir, i expect she would lock it up in that purple\\ncase of hers.”\\n\\n“is that where she usually kept important papers?”\\n\\n“yes, sir. she brought it down with her every morning, and took it up\\nevery night.”\\n\\n“when did she lose the key of it?”\\n\\n“she missed it yesterday at lunch-time, sir, and told me to look\\ncarefully for it. she was very much put out about it.”\\n\\n“but she had a duplicate key?”\\n\\n“oh, yes, sir.”\\n\\ndorcas was looking very curiously at him and, to tell the truth, so was\\ni. what was all this about a lost key? poirot smiled.\\n\\n“never mind, dorcas, it is my business to know things. is this the key\\nthat was lost?” he drew from his pocket the key that he had found in\\nthe lock of the despatch-case upstairs.\\n\\ndorcas’s eyes looked as though they would pop out of her head.\\n\\n“that’s it, sir, right enough. but where did you find it? i looked\\neverywhere for it.”\\n\\n“ah, but you see it was not in the same place yesterday as it was\\nto-day. now, to pass to another subject, had your mistress a dark green\\ndress in her wardrobe?”\\n\\ndorcas was rather startled by the unexpected question.\\n\\n“no, sir.”\\n\\n“are you quite sure?”\\n\\n“oh, yes, sir.”\\n\\n“has anyone else in the house got a green dress?”\\n\\ndorcas reflected.\\n\\n“miss cynthia has a green evening dress.”\\n\\n“light or dark green?”\\n\\n“a light green, sir; a sort of chiffon, they call it.”\\n\\n“ah, that is not what i want. and nobody else has anything green?”\\n\\n“no, sir—not that i know of.”\\n\\npoirot’s face did not betray a trace of whether he was disappointed or\\notherwise. he merely remarked:\\n\\n“good, we will leave that and pass on. have you any reason to believe\\nthat your mistress was likely to take a sleeping powder last night?”\\n\\n“not _last_ night, sir, i know she didn’t.”\\n\\n“why do you know so positively?”\\n\\n“because the box was empty. she took the last one two days ago, and she\\ndidn’t have any more made up.”\\n\\n“you are quite sure of that?”\\n\\n“positive, sir.”\\n\\n“then that is cleared up! by the way, your mistress didn’t ask you to\\nsign any paper yesterday?”\\n\\n“to sign a paper? no, sir.”\\n\\n“when mr. hastings and mr. lawrence came in yesterday evening, they\\nfound your mistress busy writing letters. i suppose you can give me no\\nidea to whom these letters were addressed?”\\n\\n“i’m afraid i couldn’t, sir. i was out in the evening. perhaps annie\\ncould tell you, though she’s a careless girl. never cleared the\\ncoffee-cups away last night. that’s what happens when i’m not here to\\nlook after things.”\\n\\npoirot lifted his hand.\\n\\n“since they have been left, dorcas, leave them a little longer, i pray\\nyou. i should like to examine them.”\\n\\n“very well, sir.”\\n\\n“what time did you go out last evening?”\\n\\n“about six o’clock, sir.”\\n\\n“thank you, dorcas, that is all i have to ask you.” he rose and\\nstrolled to the window. “i have been admiring these flower beds. how\\nmany gardeners are employed here, by the way?”\\n\\n“only three now, sir. five, we had, before the war, when it was kept as\\na gentleman’s place should be. i wish you could have seen it then, sir.\\na fair sight it was. but now there’s only old manning, and young\\nwilliam, and a new-fashioned woman gardener in breeches and such-like.\\nah, these are dreadful times!”\\n\\n“the good times will come again, dorcas. at least, we hope so. now,\\nwill you send annie to me here?”\\n\\n“yes, sir. thank you, sir.”\\n\\n“how did you know that mrs. inglethorp took sleeping powders?” i asked,\\nin lively curiosity, as dorcas left the room. “and about the lost key\\nand the duplicate?”\\n\\n“one thing at a time. as to the sleeping powders, i knew by this.” he\\nsuddenly produced a small cardboard box, such as chemists use for\\npowders.\\n\\n“where did you find it?”\\n\\n“in the wash-stand drawer in mrs. inglethorp’s bedroom. it was number\\nsix of my catalogue.”\\n\\n“but i suppose, as the last powder was taken two days ago, it is not of\\nmuch importance?”\\n\\n“probably not, but do you notice anything that strikes you as peculiar\\nabout this box?”\\n\\ni examined it closely.\\n\\n“no, i can’t say that i do.”\\n\\n“look at the label.”\\n\\ni read the label carefully: “‘one powder to be taken at bedtime, if\\nrequired. mrs. inglethorp.’ no, i see nothing unusual.”\\n\\n“not the fact that there is no chemist’s name?”\\n\\n“ah!” i exclaimed. “to be sure, that is odd!”\\n\\n“have you ever known a chemist to send out a box like that, without his\\nprinted name?”\\n\\n“no, i can’t say that i have.”\\n\\ni was becoming quite excited, but poirot damped my ardour by remarking:\\n\\n“yet the explanation is quite simple. so do not intrigue yourself, my\\nfriend.”\\n\\nan audible creaking proclaimed the approach of annie, so i had no time\\nto reply.\\n\\nannie was a fine, strapping girl, and was evidently labouring under\\nintense excitement, mingled with a certain ghoulish enjoyment of the\\ntragedy.\\n\\npoirot came to the point at once, with a business-like briskness.\\n\\n“i sent for you, annie, because i thought you might be able to tell me\\nsomething about the letters mrs. inglethorp wrote last night. how many\\nwere there? and can you tell me any of the names and addresses?”\\n\\nannie considered.\\n\\n“there were four letters, sir. one was to miss howard, and one was to\\nmr. wells, the lawyer, and the other two i don’t think i remember,\\nsir—oh, yes, one was to ross’s, the caterers in tadminster. the other\\none, i don’t remember.”\\n\\n“think,” urged poirot.\\n\\nannie racked her brains in vain.\\n\\n“i’m sorry, sir, but it’s clean gone. i don’t think i can have noticed\\nit.”\\n\\n“it does not matter,” said poirot, not betraying any sign of\\ndisappointment. “now i want to ask you about something else. there is a\\nsaucepan in mrs. inglethorp’s room with some cocoa in it. did she have\\nthat every night?”\\n\\n“yes, sir, it was put in her room every evening, and she warmed it up\\nin the night—whenever she fancied it.”\\n\\n“what was it? plain cocoa?”\\n\\n“yes, sir, made with milk, with a teaspoonful of sugar, and two\\nteaspoonfuls of rum in it.”\\n\\n“who took it to her room?”\\n\\n“i did, sir.”\\n\\n“always?”\\n\\n“yes, sir.”\\n\\n“at what time?”\\n\\n“when i went to draw the curtains, as a rule, sir.”\\n\\n“did you bring it straight up from the kitchen then?”\\n\\n“no, sir, you see there’s not much room on the gas stove, so cook used\\nto make it early, before putting the vegetables on for supper. then i\\nused to bring it up, and put it on the table by the swing door, and\\ntake it into her room later.”\\n\\n“the swing door is in the left wing, is it not?”\\n\\n“yes, sir.”\\n\\n“and the table, is it on this side of the door, or on the\\nfarther—servants’ side?”\\n\\n“it’s this side, sir.”\\n\\n“what time did you bring it up last night?”\\n\\n“about quarter-past seven, i should say, sir.”\\n\\n“and when did you take it into mrs. inglethorp’s room?”\\n\\n“when i went to shut up, sir. about eight o’clock. mrs. inglethorp came\\nup to bed before i’d finished.”\\n\\n“then, between seven-fifteen and eight o’clock, the cocoa was standing\\non the table in the left wing?”\\n\\n“yes, sir.” annie had been growing redder and redder in the face, and\\nnow she blurted out unexpectedly:\\n\\n“and if there _was_ salt in it, sir, it wasn’t me. i never took the\\nsalt near it.”\\n\\n“what makes you think there was salt in it?” asked poirot.\\n\\n“seeing it on the tray, sir.”\\n\\n“you saw some salt on the tray?”\\n\\n“yes. coarse kitchen salt, it looked. i never noticed it when i took\\nthe tray up, but when i came to take it into the mistress’s room i saw\\nit at once, and i suppose i ought to have taken it down again, and\\nasked cook to make some fresh. but i was in a hurry, because dorcas was\\nout, and i thought maybe the cocoa itself was all right, and the salt\\nhad only gone on the tray. so i dusted it off with my apron, and took\\nit in.”\\n\\ni had the utmost difficulty in controlling my excitement. unknown to\\nherself, annie had provided us with an important piece of evidence. how\\nshe would have gaped if she had realized that her “coarse kitchen salt”\\nwas strychnine, one of the most deadly poisons known to mankind. i\\nmarvelled at poirot’s calm. his self-control was astonishing. i awaited\\nhis next question with impatience, but it disappointed me.\\n\\n“when you went into mrs. inglethorp’s room, was the door leading into\\nmiss cynthia’s room bolted?”\\n\\n“oh! yes, sir; it always was. it had never been opened.”\\n\\n“and the door into mr. inglethorp’s room? did you notice if that was\\nbolted too?”\\n\\nannie hesitated.\\n\\n“i couldn’t rightly say, sir; it was shut but i couldn’t say whether it\\nwas bolted or not.”\\n\\n“when you finally left the room, did mrs. inglethorp bolt the door\\nafter you?”\\n\\n“no, sir, not then, but i expect she did later. she usually did lock it\\nat night. the door into the passage, that is.”\\n\\n“did you notice any candle grease on the floor when you did the room\\nyesterday?”\\n\\n“candle grease? oh, no, sir. mrs. inglethorp didn’t have a candle, only\\na reading-lamp.”\\n\\n“then, if there had been a large patch of candle grease on the floor,\\nyou think you would have been sure to have seen it?”\\n\\n“yes, sir, and i would have taken it out with a piece of blotting-paper\\nand a hot iron.”\\n\\nthen poirot repeated the question he had put to dorcas:\\n\\n“did your mistress ever have a green dress?”\\n\\n“no, sir.”\\n\\n“nor a mantle, nor a cape, nor a—how do you call it?—a sports coat?”\\n\\n“not green, sir.”\\n\\n“nor anyone else in the house?”\\n\\nannie reflected.\\n\\n“no, sir.”\\n\\n“you are sure of that?”\\n\\n“quite sure.”\\n\\n“_bien!_ that is all i want to know. thank you very much.”\\n\\nwith a nervous giggle, annie took herself creakingly out of the room.\\nmy pent-up excitement burst forth.\\n\\n“poirot,” i cried, “i congratulate you! this is a great discovery.”\\n\\n“what is a great discovery?”\\n\\n“why, that it was the cocoa and not the coffee that was poisoned. that\\nexplains everything! of course it did not take effect until the early\\nmorning, since the cocoa was only drunk in the middle of the night.”\\n\\n“so you think that the cocoa—mark well what i say, hastings, the\\n_cocoa_—contained strychnine?”\\n\\n“of course! that salt on the tray, what else could it have been?”\\n\\n“it might have been salt,” replied poirot placidly.\\n\\ni shrugged my shoulders. if he was going to take the matter that way,\\nit was no good arguing with him. the idea crossed my mind, not for the\\nfirst time, that poor old poirot was growing old. privately i thought\\nit lucky that he had associated with him someone of a more receptive\\ntype of mind.\\n\\npoirot was surveying me with quietly twinkling eyes.\\n\\n“you are not pleased with me, _mon ami?_”\\n\\n“my dear poirot,” i said coldly, “it is not for me to dictate to you.\\nyou have a right to your own opinion, just as i have to mine.”\\n\\n“a most admirable sentiment,” remarked poirot, rising briskly to his\\nfeet. “now i have finished with this room. by the way, whose is the\\nsmaller desk in the corner?”\\n\\n“mr. inglethorp’s.”\\n\\n“ah!” he tried the roll top tentatively. “locked. but perhaps one of\\nmrs. inglethorp’s keys would open it.” he tried several, twisting and\\nturning them with a practiced hand, and finally uttering an ejaculation\\nof satisfaction. “_voilà!_ it is not the key, but it will open it at a\\npinch.” he slid back the roll top, and ran a rapid eye over the neatly\\nfiled papers. to my surprise, he did not examine them, merely remarking\\napprovingly as he relocked the desk: “decidedly, he is a man of method,\\nthis mr. inglethorp!”\\n\\na “man of method” was, in poirot’s estimation, the highest praise that\\ncould be bestowed on any individual.\\n\\ni felt that my friend was not what he had been as he rambled on\\ndisconnectedly:\\n\\n“there were no stamps in his desk, but there might have been, eh, _mon\\nami?_ there might have been? yes”—his eyes wandered round the\\nroom—“this boudoir has nothing more to tell us. it did not yield much.\\nonly this.”\\n\\nhe pulled a crumpled envelope out of his pocket, and tossed it over to\\nme. it was rather a curious document. a plain, dirty looking old\\nenvelope with a few words scrawled across it, apparently at random. the\\nfollowing is a facsimile of it.\\n\\n[illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter v.\\n“it isn’t strychnine, is it?”\\n\\n\\n“where did you find this?” i asked poirot, in lively curiosity.\\n\\n“in the waste-paper basket. you recognise the handwriting?”\\n\\n“yes, it is mrs. inglethorp’s. but what does it mean?”\\n\\npoirot shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n“i cannot say—but it is suggestive.”\\n\\na wild idea flashed across me. was it possible that mrs. inglethorp’s\\nmind was deranged? had she some fantastic idea of demoniacal\\npossession? and, if that were so, was it not also possible that she\\nmight have taken her own life?\\n\\ni was about to expound these theories to poirot, when his own words\\ndistracted me.\\n\\n“come,” he said, “now to examine the coffee-cups!”\\n\\n“my dear poirot! what on earth is the good of that, now that we know\\nabout the cocoa?”\\n\\n“oh, _là là!_ that miserable cocoa!” cried poirot flippantly.\\n\\nhe laughed with apparent enjoyment, raising his arms to heaven in mock\\ndespair, in what i could not but consider the worst possible taste.\\n\\n“and, anyway,” i said, with increasing coldness, “as mrs. inglethorp\\ntook her coffee upstairs with her, i do not see what you expect to\\nfind, unless you consider it likely that we shall discover a packet of\\nstrychnine on the coffee tray!”\\n\\npoirot was sobered at once.\\n\\n“come, come, my friend,” he said, slipping his arms through mine. “_ne\\nvous fâchez pas!_ allow me to interest myself in my coffee-cups, and i\\nwill respect your cocoa. there! is it a bargain?”\\n\\nhe was so quaintly humorous that i was forced to laugh; and we went\\ntogether to the drawing-room, where the coffee-cups and tray remained\\nundisturbed as we had left them.\\n\\npoirot made me recapitulate the scene of the night before, listening\\nvery carefully, and verifying the position of the various cups.\\n\\n“so mrs. cavendish stood by the tray—and poured out. yes. then she came\\nacross to the window where you sat with mademoiselle cynthia. yes. here\\nare the three cups. and the cup on the mantelpiece, half drunk, that\\nwould be mr. lawrence cavendish’s. and the one on the tray?”\\n\\n“john cavendish’s. i saw him put it down there.”\\n\\n“good. one, two, three, four, five—but where, then, is the cup of mr.\\ninglethorp?”\\n\\n“he does not take coffee.”\\n\\n“then all are accounted for. one moment, my friend.”\\n\\nwith infinite care, he took a drop or two from the grounds in each cup,\\nsealing them up in separate test tubes, tasting each in turn as he did\\nso. his physiognomy underwent a curious change. an expression gathered\\nthere that i can only describe as half puzzled, and half relieved.\\n\\n“_bien!_” he said at last. “it is evident! i had an idea—but clearly i\\nwas mistaken. yes, altogether i was mistaken. yet it is strange. but no\\nmatter!”\\n\\nand, with a characteristic shrug, he dismissed whatever it was that was\\nworrying him from his mind. i could have told him from the beginning\\nthat this obsession of his over the coffee was bound to end in a blind\\nalley, but i restrained my tongue. after all, though he was old, poirot\\nhad been a great man in his day.\\n\\n“breakfast is ready,” said john cavendish, coming in from the hall.\\n“you will breakfast with us, monsieur poirot?”\\n\\npoirot acquiesced. i observed john. already he was almost restored to\\nhis normal self. the shock of the events of the last night had upset\\nhim temporarily, but his equable poise soon swung back to the normal.\\nhe was a man of very little imagination, in sharp contrast with his\\nbrother, who had, perhaps, too much.\\n\\never since the early hours of the morning, john had been hard at work,\\nsending telegrams—one of the first had gone to evelyn howard—writing\\nnotices for the papers, and generally occupying himself with the\\nmelancholy duties that a death entails.\\n\\n“may i ask how things are proceeding?” he said. “do your investigations\\npoint to my mother having died a natural death—or—or must we prepare\\nourselves for the worst?”\\n\\n“i think, mr. cavendish,” said poirot gravely, “that you would do well\\nnot to buoy yourself up with any false hopes. can you tell me the views\\nof the other members of the family?”\\n\\n“my brother lawrence is convinced that we are making a fuss over\\nnothing. he says that everything points to its being a simple case of\\nheart failure.”\\n\\n“he does, does he? that is very interesting—very interesting,” murmured\\npoirot softly. “and mrs. cavendish?”\\n\\na faint cloud passed over john’s face.\\n\\n“i have not the least idea what my wife’s views on the subject are.”\\n\\nthe answer brought a momentary stiffness in its train. john broke the\\nrather awkward silence by saying with a slight effort:\\n\\n“i told you, didn’t i, that mr. inglethorp has returned?”\\n\\npoirot bent his head.\\n\\n“it’s an awkward position for all of us. of course one has to treat him\\nas usual—but, hang it all, one’s gorge does rise at sitting down to eat\\nwith a possible murderer!”\\n\\npoirot nodded sympathetically.\\n\\n“i quite understand. it is a very difficult situation for you, mr.\\ncavendish. i would like to ask you one question. mr. inglethorp’s\\nreason for not returning last night was, i believe, that he had\\nforgotten the latch-key. is not that so?”\\n\\n“yes.”\\n\\n“i suppose you are quite sure that the latch-key _was_ forgotten—that\\nhe did not take it after all?”\\n\\n“i have no idea. i never thought of looking. we always keep it in the\\nhall drawer. i’ll go and see if it’s there now.”\\n\\npoirot held up his hand with a faint smile.\\n\\n“no, no, mr. cavendish, it is too late now. i am certain that you would\\nfind it. if mr. inglethorp did take it, he has had ample time to\\nreplace it by now.”\\n\\n“but do you think——”\\n\\n“i think nothing. if anyone had chanced to look this morning before his\\nreturn, and seen it there, it would have been a valuable point in his\\nfavour. that is all.”\\n\\njohn looked perplexed.\\n\\n“do not worry,” said poirot smoothly. “i assure you that you need not\\nlet it trouble you. since you are so kind, let us go and have some\\nbreakfast.”\\n\\neveryone was assembled in the dining-room. under the circumstances, we\\nwere naturally not a cheerful party. the reaction after a shock is\\nalways trying, and i think we were all suffering from it. decorum and\\ngood breeding naturally enjoined that our demeanour should be much as\\nusual, yet i could not help wondering if this self-control were really\\na matter of great difficulty. there were no red eyes, no signs of\\nsecretly indulged grief. i felt that i was right in my opinion that\\ndorcas was the person most affected by the personal side of the\\ntragedy.\\n\\ni pass over alfred inglethorp, who acted the bereaved widower in a\\nmanner that i felt to be disgusting in its hypocrisy. did he know that\\nwe suspected him, i wondered. surely he could not be unaware of the\\nfact, conceal it as we would. did he feel some secret stirring of fear,\\nor was he confident that his crime would go unpunished? surely the\\nsuspicion in the atmosphere must warn him that he was already a marked\\nman.\\n\\nbut did everyone suspect him? what about mrs. cavendish? i watched her\\nas she sat at the head of the table, graceful, composed, enigmatic. in\\nher soft grey frock, with white ruffles at the wrists falling over her\\nslender hands, she looked very beautiful. when she chose, however, her\\nface could be sphinx-like in its inscrutability. she was very silent,\\nhardly opening her lips, and yet in some queer way i felt that the\\ngreat strength of her personality was dominating us all.\\n\\nand little cynthia? did she suspect? she looked very tired and ill, i\\nthought. the heaviness and languor of her manner were very marked. i\\nasked her if she were feeling ill, and she answered frankly:\\n\\n“yes, i’ve got the most beastly headache.”\\n\\n“have another cup of coffee, mademoiselle?” said poirot solicitously.\\n“it will revive you. it is unparalleled for the _mal de tête_.” he\\njumped up and took her cup.\\n\\n“no sugar,” said cynthia, watching him, as he picked up the\\nsugar-tongs.\\n\\n“no sugar? you abandon it in the war-time, eh?”\\n\\n“no, i never take it in coffee.”\\n\\n“_sacré!_” murmured poirot to himself, as he brought back the\\nreplenished cup.\\n\\nonly i heard him, and glancing up curiously at the little man i saw\\nthat his face was working with suppressed excitement, and his eyes were\\nas green as a cat’s. he had heard or seen something that had affected\\nhim strongly—but what was it? i do not usually label myself as dense,\\nbut i must confess that nothing out of the ordinary had attracted _my_\\nattention.\\n\\nin another moment, the door opened and dorcas appeared.\\n\\n“mr. wells to see you, sir,” she said to john.\\n\\ni remembered the name as being that of the lawyer to whom mrs.\\ninglethorp had written the night before.\\n\\njohn rose immediately.\\n\\n“show him into my study.” then he turned to us. “my mother’s lawyer,”\\nhe explained. and in a lower voice: “he is also coroner—you understand.\\nperhaps you would like to come with me?”\\n\\nwe acquiesced and followed him out of the room. john strode on ahead\\nand i took the opportunity of whispering to poirot:\\n\\n“there will be an inquest then?”\\n\\npoirot nodded absently. he seemed absorbed in thought; so much so that\\nmy curiosity was aroused.\\n\\n“what is it? you are not attending to what i say.”\\n\\n“it is true, my friend. i am much worried.”\\n\\n“why?”\\n\\n“because mademoiselle cynthia does not take sugar in her coffee.”\\n\\n“what? you cannot be serious?”\\n\\n“but i am most serious. ah, there is something there that i do not\\nunderstand. my instinct was right.”\\n\\n“what instinct?”\\n\\n“the instinct that led me to insist on examining those coffee-cups.\\n_chut!_ no more now!”\\n\\nwe followed john into his study, and he closed the door behind us.\\n\\nmr. wells was a pleasant man of middle-age, with keen eyes, and the\\ntypical lawyer’s mouth. john introduced us both, and explained the\\nreason of our presence.\\n\\n“you will understand, wells,” he added, “that this is all strictly\\nprivate. we are still hoping that there will turn out to be no need for\\ninvestigation of any kind.”\\n\\n“quite so, quite so,” said mr. wells soothingly. “i wish we could have\\nspared you the pain and publicity of an inquest, but of course it’s\\nquite unavoidable in the absence of a doctor’s certificate.”\\n\\n“yes, i suppose so.”\\n\\n“clever man, bauerstein. great authority on toxicology, i believe.”\\n\\n“indeed,” said john with a certain stiffness in his manner. then he\\nadded rather hesitatingly: “shall we have to appear as witnesses—all of\\nus, i mean?”\\n\\n“you, of course—and ah—er—mr.—er—inglethorp.”\\n\\na slight pause ensued before the lawyer went on in his soothing manner:\\n\\n“any other evidence will be simply confirmatory, a mere matter of\\nform.”\\n\\n“i see.”\\n\\na faint expression of relief swept over john’s face. it puzzled me, for\\ni saw no occasion for it.\\n\\n“if you know of nothing to the contrary,” pursued mr. wells, “i had\\nthought of friday. that will give us plenty of time for the doctor’s\\nreport. the post-mortem is to take place to-night, i believe?”\\n\\n“yes.”\\n\\n“then that arrangement will suit you?”\\n\\n“perfectly.”\\n\\n“i need not tell you, my dear cavendish, how distressed i am at this\\nmost tragic affair.”\\n\\n“can you give us no help in solving it, monsieur?” interposed poirot,\\nspeaking for the first time since we had entered the room.\\n\\n“i?”\\n\\n“yes, we heard that mrs. inglethorp wrote to you last night. you should\\nhave received the letter this morning.”\\n\\n“i did, but it contains no information. it is merely a note asking me\\nto call upon her this morning, as she wanted my advice on a matter of\\ngreat importance.”\\n\\n“she gave you no hint as to what that matter might be?”\\n\\n“unfortunately, no.”\\n\\n“that is a pity,” said john.\\n\\n“a great pity,” agreed poirot gravely.\\n\\nthere was silence. poirot remained lost in thought for a few minutes.\\nfinally he turned to the lawyer again.\\n\\n“mr. wells, there is one thing i should like to ask you—that is, if it\\nis not against professional etiquette. in the event of mrs.\\ninglethorp’s death, who would inherit her money?”\\n\\nthe lawyer hesitated a moment, and then replied:\\n\\n“the knowledge will be public property very soon, so if mr. cavendish\\ndoes not object——”\\n\\n“not at all,” interpolated john.\\n\\n“i do not see any reason why i should not answer your question. by her\\nlast will, dated august of last year, after various unimportant\\nlegacies to servants, etc., she gave her entire fortune to her stepson,\\nmr. john cavendish.”\\n\\n“was not that—pardon the question, mr. cavendish—rather unfair to her\\nother stepson, mr. lawrence cavendish?”\\n\\n“no, i do not think so. you see, under the terms of their father’s\\nwill, while john inherited the property, lawrence, at his stepmother’s\\ndeath, would come into a considerable sum of money. mrs. inglethorp\\nleft her money to her elder stepson, knowing that he would have to keep\\nup styles. it was, to my mind, a very fair and equitable distribution.”\\n\\npoirot nodded thoughtfully.\\n\\n“i see. but i am right in saying, am i not, that by your english law\\nthat will was automatically revoked when mrs. inglethorp remarried?”\\n\\nmr. wells bowed his head.\\n\\n“as i was about to proceed, monsieur poirot, that document is now null\\nand void.”\\n\\n“_hein!_” said poirot. he reflected for a moment, and then asked: “was\\nmrs. inglethorp herself aware of that fact?”\\n\\n“i do not know. she may have been.”\\n\\n“she was,” said john unexpectedly. “we were discussing the matter of\\nwills being revoked by marriage only yesterday.”\\n\\n“ah! one more question, mr. wells. you say ‘her last will.’ had mrs.\\ninglethorp, then, made several former wills?”\\n\\n“on an average, she made a new will at least once a year,” said mr.\\nwells imperturbably. “she was given to changing her mind as to her\\ntestamentary dispositions, now benefiting one, now another member of\\nher family.”\\n\\n“suppose,” suggested poirot, “that, unknown to you, she had made a new\\nwill in favour of someone who was not, in any sense of the word, a\\nmember of the family—we will say miss howard, for instance—would you be\\nsurprised?”\\n\\n“not in the least.”\\n\\n“ah!” poirot seemed to have exhausted his questions.\\n\\ni drew close to him, while john and the lawyer were debating the\\nquestion of going through mrs. inglethorp’s papers.\\n\\n“do you think mrs. inglethorp made a will leaving all her money to miss\\nhoward?” i asked in a low voice, with some curiosity.\\n\\npoirot smiled.\\n\\n“no.”\\n\\n“then why did you ask?”\\n\\n“hush!”\\n\\njohn cavendish had turned to poirot.\\n\\n“will you come with us, monsieur poirot? we are going through my\\nmother’s papers. mr. inglethorp is quite willing to leave it entirely\\nto mr. wells and myself.”\\n\\n“which simplifies matters very much,” murmured the lawyer. “as\\ntechnically, of course, he was entitled——” he did not finish the\\nsentence.\\n\\n“we will look through the desk in the boudoir first,” explained john,\\n“and go up to her bedroom afterwards. she kept her most important\\npapers in a purple despatch-case, which we must look through\\ncarefully.”\\n\\n“yes,” said the lawyer, “it is quite possible that there may be a later\\nwill than the one in my possession.”\\n\\n“there _is_ a later will.” it was poirot who spoke.\\n\\n“what?” john and the lawyer looked at him startled.\\n\\n“or, rather,” pursued my friend imperturbably, “there _was_ one.”\\n\\n“what do you mean—there was one? where is it now?”\\n\\n“burnt!”\\n\\n“burnt?”\\n\\n“yes. see here.” he took out the charred fragment we had found in the\\ngrate in mrs. inglethorp’s room, and handed it to the lawyer with a\\nbrief explanation of when and where he had found it.\\n\\n“but possibly this is an old will?”\\n\\n“i do not think so. in fact i am almost certain that it was made no\\nearlier than yesterday afternoon.”\\n\\n“what?” “impossible!” broke simultaneously from both men.\\n\\npoirot turned to john.\\n\\n“if you will allow me to send for your gardener, i will prove it to\\nyou.”\\n\\n“oh, of course—but i don’t see——”\\n\\npoirot raised his hand.\\n\\n“do as i ask you. afterwards you shall question as much as you please.”\\n\\n“very well.” he rang the bell.\\n\\ndorcas answered it in due course.\\n\\n“dorcas, will you tell manning to come round and speak to me here.”\\n\\n“yes, sir.”\\n\\ndorcas withdrew.\\n\\nwe waited in a tense silence. poirot alone seemed perfectly at his\\nease, and dusted a forgotten corner of the bookcase.\\n\\nthe clumping of hobnailed boots on the gravel outside proclaimed the\\napproach of manning. john looked questioningly at poirot. the latter\\nnodded.\\n\\n“come inside, manning,” said john, “i want to speak to you.”\\n\\nmanning came slowly and hesitatingly through the french window, and\\nstood as near it as he could. he held his cap in his hands, twisting it\\nvery carefully round and round. his back was much bent, though he was\\nprobably not as old as he looked, but his eyes were sharp and\\nintelligent, and belied his slow and rather cautious speech.\\n\\n“manning,” said john, “this gentleman will put some questions to you\\nwhich i want you to answer.”\\n\\n“yessir,” mumbled manning.\\n\\npoirot stepped forward briskly. manning’s eye swept over him with a\\nfaint contempt.\\n\\n“you were planting a bed of begonias round by the south side of the\\nhouse yesterday afternoon, were you not, manning?”\\n\\n“yes, sir, me and willum.”\\n\\n“and mrs. inglethorp came to the window and called you, did she not?”\\n\\n“yes, sir, she did.”\\n\\n“tell me in your own words exactly what happened after that.”\\n\\n“well, sir, nothing much. she just told willum to go on his bicycle\\ndown to the village, and bring back a form of will, or such-like—i\\ndon’t know what exactly—she wrote it down for him.”\\n\\n“well?”\\n\\n“well, he did, sir.”\\n\\n“and what happened next?”\\n\\n“we went on with the begonias, sir.”\\n\\n“did not mrs. inglethorp call you again?”\\n\\n“yes, sir, both me and willum, she called.”\\n\\n“and then?”\\n\\n“she made us come right in, and sign our names at the bottom of a long\\npaper—under where she’d signed.”\\n\\n“did you see anything of what was written above her signature?” asked\\npoirot sharply.\\n\\n“no, sir, there was a bit of blotting paper over that part.”\\n\\n“and you signed where she told you?”\\n\\n“yes, sir, first me and then willum.”\\n\\n“what did she do with it afterwards?”\\n\\n“well, sir, she slipped it into a long envelope, and put it inside a\\nsort of purple box that was standing on the desk.”\\n\\n“what time was it when she first called you?”\\n\\n“about four, i should say, sir.”\\n\\n“not earlier? couldn’t it have been about half-past three?”\\n\\n“no, i shouldn’t say so, sir. it would be more likely to be a bit after\\nfour—not before it.”\\n\\n“thank you, manning, that will do,” said poirot pleasantly.\\n\\nthe gardener glanced at his master, who nodded, whereupon manning\\nlifted a finger to his forehead with a low mumble, and backed\\ncautiously out of the window.\\n\\nwe all looked at each other.\\n\\n“good heavens!” murmured john. “what an extraordinary coincidence.”\\n\\n“how—a coincidence?”\\n\\n“that my mother should have made a will on the very day of her death!”\\n\\nmr. wells cleared his throat and remarked drily:\\n\\n“are you so sure it is a coincidence, cavendish?”\\n\\n“what do you mean?”\\n\\n“your mother, you tell me, had a violent quarrel with—someone yesterday\\nafternoon——”\\n\\n“what do you mean?” cried john again. there was a tremor in his voice,\\nand he had gone very pale.\\n\\n“in consequence of that quarrel, your mother very suddenly and\\nhurriedly makes a new will. the contents of that will we shall never\\nknow. she told no one of its provisions. this morning, no doubt, she\\nwould have consulted me on the subject—but she had no chance. the will\\ndisappears, and she takes its secret with her to her grave. cavendish,\\ni much fear there is no coincidence there. monsieur poirot, i am sure\\nyou agree with me that the facts are very suggestive.”\\n\\n“suggestive, or not,” interrupted john, “we are most grateful to\\nmonsieur poirot for elucidating the matter. but for him, we should\\nnever have known of this will. i suppose, i may not ask you, monsieur,\\nwhat first led you to suspect the fact?”\\n\\npoirot smiled and answered:\\n\\n“a scribbled over old envelope, and a freshly planted bed of begonias.”\\n\\njohn, i think, would have pressed his questions further, but at that\\nmoment the loud purr of a motor was audible, and we all turned to the\\nwindow as it swept past.\\n\\n“evie!” cried john. “excuse me, wells.” he went hurriedly out into the\\nhall.\\n\\npoirot looked inquiringly at me.\\n\\n“miss howard,” i explained.\\n\\n“ah, i am glad she has come. there is a woman with a head and a heart\\ntoo, hastings. though the good god gave her no beauty!”\\n\\ni followed john’s example, and went out into the hall, where miss\\nhoward was endeavouring to extricate herself from the voluminous mass\\nof veils that enveloped her head. as her eyes fell on me, a sudden pang\\nof guilt shot through me. this was the woman who had warned me so\\nearnestly, and to whose warning i had, alas, paid no heed! how soon,\\nand how contemptuously, i had dismissed it from my mind. now that she\\nhad been proved justified in so tragic a manner, i felt ashamed. she\\nhad known alfred inglethorp only too well. i wondered whether, if she\\nhad remained at styles, the tragedy would have taken place, or would\\nthe man have feared her watchful eyes?\\n\\ni was relieved when she shook me by the hand, with her well remembered\\npainful grip. the eyes that met mine were sad, but not reproachful;\\nthat she had been crying bitterly, i could tell by the redness of her\\neyelids, but her manner was unchanged from its old gruffness.\\n\\n“started the moment i got the wire. just come off night duty. hired\\ncar. quickest way to get here.”\\n\\n“have you had anything to eat this morning, evie?” asked john.\\n\\n“no.”\\n\\n“i thought not. come along, breakfast’s not cleared away yet, and\\nthey’ll make you some fresh tea.” he turned to me. “look after her,\\nhastings, will you? wells is waiting for me. oh, here’s monsieur\\npoirot. he’s helping us, you know, evie.”\\n\\nmiss howard shook hands with poirot, but glanced suspiciously over her\\nshoulder at john.\\n\\n“what do you mean—helping us?”\\n\\n“helping us to investigate.”\\n\\n“nothing to investigate. have they taken him to prison yet?”\\n\\n“taken who to prison?”\\n\\n“who? alfred inglethorp, of course!”\\n\\n“my dear evie, do be careful. lawrence is of the opinion that my mother\\ndied from heart seizure.”\\n\\n“more fool, lawrence!” retorted miss howard. “of course alfred\\ninglethorp murdered poor emily—as i always told you he would.”\\n\\n“my dear evie, don’t shout so. whatever we may think or suspect, it is\\nbetter to say as little as possible for the present. the inquest isn’t\\nuntil friday.”\\n\\n“not until fiddlesticks!” the snort miss howard gave was truly\\nmagnificent. “you’re all off your heads. the man will be out of the\\ncountry by then. if he’s any sense, he won’t stay here tamely and wait\\nto be hanged.”\\n\\njohn cavendish looked at her helplessly.\\n\\n“i know what it is,” she accused him, “you’ve been listening to the\\ndoctors. never should. what do they know? nothing at all—or just enough\\nto make them dangerous. i ought to know—my own father was a doctor.\\nthat little wilkins is about the greatest fool that even i have ever\\nseen. heart seizure! sort of thing he would say. anyone with any sense\\ncould see at once that her husband had poisoned her. i always said he’d\\nmurder her in her bed, poor soul. now he’s done it. and all you can do\\nis to murmur silly things about ‘heart seizure’ and ‘inquest on\\nfriday.’ you ought to be ashamed of yourself, john cavendish.”\\n\\n“what do you want me to do?” asked john, unable to help a faint smile.\\n“dash it all, evie, i can’t haul him down to the local police station\\nby the scruff of his neck.”\\n\\n“well, you might do something. find out how he did it. he’s a crafty\\nbeggar. dare say he soaked fly papers. ask cook if she’s missed any.”\\n\\nit occurred to me very forcibly at that moment that to harbour miss\\nhoward and alfred inglethorp under the same roof, and keep the peace\\nbetween them, was likely to prove a herculean task, and i did not envy\\njohn. i could see by the expression of his face that he fully\\nappreciated the difficulty of the position. for the moment, he sought\\nrefuge in retreat, and left the room precipitately.\\n\\ndorcas brought in fresh tea. as she left the room, poirot came over\\nfrom the window where he had been standing, and sat down facing miss\\nhoward.\\n\\n“mademoiselle,” he said gravely, “i want to ask you something.”\\n\\n“ask away,” said the lady, eyeing him with some disfavour.\\n\\n“i want to be able to count upon your help.”\\n\\n“i’ll help you to hang alfred with pleasure,” she replied gruffly.\\n“hanging’s too good for him. ought to be drawn and quartered, like in\\ngood old times.”\\n\\n“we are at one then,” said poirot, “for i, too, want to hang the\\ncriminal.”\\n\\n“alfred inglethorp?”\\n\\n“him, or another.”\\n\\n“no question of another. poor emily was never murdered until _he_ came\\nalong. i don’t say she wasn’t surrounded by sharks—she was. but it was\\nonly her purse they were after. her life was safe enough. but along\\ncomes mr. alfred inglethorp—and within two months—hey presto!”\\n\\n“believe me, miss howard,” said poirot very earnestly, “if mr.\\ninglethorp is the man, he shall not escape me. on my honour, i will\\nhang him as high as haman!”\\n\\n“that’s better,” said miss howard more enthusiastically.\\n\\n“but i must ask you to trust me. now your help may be very valuable to\\nme. i will tell you why. because, in all this house of mourning, yours\\nare the only eyes that have wept.”\\n\\nmiss howard blinked, and a new note crept into the gruffness of her\\nvoice.\\n\\n“if you mean that i was fond of her—yes, i was. you know, emily was a\\nselfish old woman in her way. she was very generous, but she always\\nwanted a return. she never let people forget what she had done for\\nthem—and, that way she missed love. don’t think she ever realized it,\\nthough, or felt the lack of it. hope not, anyway. i was on a different\\nfooting. i took my stand from the first. ‘so many pounds a year i’m\\nworth to you. well and good. but not a penny piece besides—not a pair\\nof gloves, nor a theatre ticket.’ she didn’t understand—was very\\noffended sometimes. said i was foolishly proud. it wasn’t that—but i\\ncouldn’t explain. anyway, i kept my self-respect. and so, out of the\\nwhole bunch, i was the only one who could allow myself to be fond of\\nher. i watched over her. i guarded her from the lot of them, and then a\\nglib-tongued scoundrel comes along, and pooh! all my years of devotion\\ngo for nothing.”\\n\\npoirot nodded sympathetically.\\n\\n“i understand, mademoiselle, i understand all you feel. it is most\\nnatural. you think that we are lukewarm—that we lack fire and\\nenergy—but trust me, it is not so.”\\n\\njohn stuck his head in at this juncture, and invited us both to come up\\nto mrs. inglethorp’s room, as he and mr. wells had finished looking\\nthrough the desk in the boudoir.\\n\\nas we went up the stairs, john looked back to the dining-room door, and\\nlowered his voice confidentially:\\n\\n“look here, what’s going to happen when these two meet?”\\n\\ni shook my head helplessly.\\n\\n“i’ve told mary to keep them apart if she can.”\\n\\n“will she be able to do so?”\\n\\n“the lord only knows. there’s one thing, inglethorp himself won’t be\\ntoo keen on meeting her.”\\n\\n“you’ve got the keys still, haven’t you, poirot?” i asked, as we\\nreached the door of the locked room.\\n\\ntaking the keys from poirot, john unlocked it, and we all passed in.\\nthe lawyer went straight to the desk, and john followed him.\\n\\n“my mother kept most of her important papers in this despatch-case, i\\nbelieve,” he said.\\n\\npoirot drew out the small bunch of keys.\\n\\n“permit me. i locked it, out of precaution, this morning.”\\n\\n“but it’s not locked now.”\\n\\n“impossible!”\\n\\n“see.” and john lifted the lid as he spoke.\\n\\n“_milles tonnerres!_” cried poirot, dumbfounded. “and i—who have both\\nthe keys in my pocket!” he flung himself upon the case. suddenly he\\nstiffened. “_eh voilà une affaire!_ this lock has been forced.”\\n\\n“what?”\\n\\npoirot laid down the case again.\\n\\n“but who forced it? why should they? when? but the door was locked?”\\nthese exclamations burst from us disjointedly.\\n\\npoirot answered them categorically—almost mechanically.\\n\\n“who? that is the question. why? ah, if i only knew. when? since i was\\nhere an hour ago. as to the door being locked, it is a very ordinary\\nlock. probably any other of the doorkeys in this passage would fit it.”\\n\\nwe stared at one another blankly. poirot had walked over to the\\nmantelpiece. he was outwardly calm, but i noticed his hands, which from\\nlong force of habit were mechanically straightening the spill vases on\\nthe mantelpiece, were shaking violently.\\n\\n“see here, it was like this,” he said at last. “there was something in\\nthat case—some piece of evidence, slight in itself perhaps, but still\\nenough of a clue to connect the murderer with the crime. it was vital\\nto him that it should be destroyed before it was discovered and its\\nsignificance appreciated. therefore, he took the risk, the great risk,\\nof coming in here. finding the case locked, he was obliged to force it,\\nthus betraying his presence. for him to take that risk, it must have\\nbeen something of great importance.”\\n\\n“but what was it?”\\n\\n“ah!” cried poirot, with a gesture of anger. “that, i do not know! a\\ndocument of some kind, without doubt, possibly the scrap of paper\\ndorcas saw in her hand yesterday afternoon. and i—” his anger burst\\nforth freely—“miserable animal that i am! i guessed nothing! i have\\nbehaved like an imbecile! i should never have left that case here. i\\nshould have carried it away with me. ah, triple pig! and now it is\\ngone. it is destroyed—but is it destroyed? is there not yet a chance—we\\nmust leave no stone unturned—”\\n\\nhe rushed like a madman from the room, and i followed him as soon as i\\nhad sufficiently recovered my wits. but, by the time i had reached the\\ntop of the stairs, he was out of sight.\\n\\nmary cavendish was standing where the staircase branched, staring down\\ninto the hall in the direction in which he had disappeared.\\n\\n“what has happened to your extraordinary little friend, mr. hastings?\\nhe has just rushed past me like a mad bull.”\\n\\n“he’s rather upset about something,” i remarked feebly. i really did\\nnot know how much poirot would wish me to disclose. as i saw a faint\\nsmile gather on mrs. cavendish’s expressive mouth, i endeavoured to try\\nand turn the conversation by saying: “they haven’t met yet, have they?”\\n\\n“who?”\\n\\n“mr. inglethorp and miss howard.”\\n\\nshe looked at me in rather a disconcerting manner.\\n\\n“do you think it would be such a disaster if they did meet?”\\n\\n“well, don’t you?” i said, rather taken aback.\\n\\n“no.” she was smiling in her quiet way. “i should like to see a good\\nflare up. it would clear the air. at present we are all thinking so\\nmuch, and saying so little.”\\n\\n“john doesn’t think so,” i remarked. “he’s anxious to keep them apart.”\\n\\n“oh, john!”\\n\\nsomething in her tone fired me, and i blurted out:\\n\\n“old john’s an awfully good sort.”\\n\\nshe studied me curiously for a minute or two, and then said, to my\\ngreat surprise:\\n\\n“you are loyal to your friend. i like you for that.”\\n\\n“aren’t you my friend too?”\\n\\n“i am a very bad friend.”\\n\\n“why do you say that?”\\n\\n“because it is true. i am charming to my friends one day, and forget\\nall about them the next.”\\n\\ni don’t know what impelled me, but i was nettled, and i said foolishly\\nand not in the best of taste:\\n\\n“yet you seem to be invariably charming to dr. bauerstein!”\\n\\ninstantly i regretted my words. her face stiffened. i had the\\nimpression of a steel curtain coming down and blotting out the real\\nwoman. without a word, she turned and went swiftly up the stairs,\\nwhilst i stood like an idiot gaping after her.\\n\\ni was recalled to other matters by a frightful row going on below. i\\ncould hear poirot shouting and expounding. i was vexed to think that my\\ndiplomacy had been in vain. the little man appeared to be taking the\\nwhole house into his confidence, a proceeding of which i, for one,\\ndoubted the wisdom. once again i could not help regretting that my\\nfriend was so prone to lose his head in moments of excitement. i\\nstepped briskly down the stairs. the sight of me calmed poirot almost\\nimmediately. i drew him aside.\\n\\n“my dear fellow,” i said, “is this wise? surely you don’t want the\\nwhole house to know of this occurrence? you are actually playing into\\nthe criminal’s hands.”\\n\\n“you think so, hastings?”\\n\\n“i am sure of it.”\\n\\n“well, well, my friend, i will be guided by you.”\\n\\n“good. although, unfortunately, it is a little too late now.”\\n\\n“sure.”\\n\\nhe looked so crestfallen and abashed that i felt quite sorry, though i\\nstill thought my rebuke a just and wise one.\\n\\n“well,” he said at last, “let us go, _mon ami_.”\\n\\n“you have finished here?”\\n\\n“for the moment, yes. you will walk back with me to the village?”\\n\\n“willingly.”\\n\\nhe picked up his little suit-case, and we went out through the open\\nwindow in the drawing-room. cynthia murdoch was just coming in, and\\npoirot stood aside to let her pass.\\n\\n“excuse me, mademoiselle, one minute.”\\n\\n“yes?” she turned inquiringly.\\n\\n“did you ever make up mrs. inglethorp’s medicines?”\\n\\na slight flush rose in her face, as she answered rather constrainedly:\\n\\n“no.”\\n\\n“only her powders?”\\n\\nthe flush deepened as cynthia replied:\\n\\n“oh, yes, i did make up some sleeping powders for her once.”\\n\\n“these?”\\n\\npoirot produced the empty box which had contained powders.\\n\\nshe nodded.\\n\\n“can you tell me what they were? sulphonal? veronal?”\\n\\n“no, they were bromide powders.”\\n\\n“ah! thank you, mademoiselle; good morning.”\\n\\nas we walked briskly away from the house, i glanced at him more than\\nonce. i had often before noticed that, if anything excited him, his\\neyes turned green like a cat’s. they were shining like emeralds now.\\n\\n“my friend,” he broke out at last, “i have a little idea, a very\\nstrange, and probably utterly impossible idea. and yet—it fits in.”\\n\\ni shrugged my shoulders. i privately thought that poirot was rather too\\nmuch given to these fantastic ideas. in this case, surely, the truth\\nwas only too plain and apparent.\\n\\n“so that is the explanation of the blank label on the box,” i remarked.\\n“very simple, as you said. i really wonder that i did not think of it\\nmyself.”\\n\\npoirot did not appear to be listening to me.\\n\\n“they have made one more discovery, _là-bas_,” he observed, jerking his\\nthumb over his shoulder in the direction of styles. “mr. wells told me\\nas we were going upstairs.”\\n\\n“what was it?”\\n\\n“locked up in the desk in the boudoir, they found a will of mrs.\\ninglethorp’s, dated before her marriage, leaving her fortune to alfred\\ninglethorp. it must have been made just at the time they were engaged.\\nit came quite as a surprise to wells—and to john cavendish also. it was\\nwritten on one of those printed will forms, and witnessed by two of the\\nservants—not dorcas.”\\n\\n“did mr. inglethorp know of it?”\\n\\n“he says not.”\\n\\n“one might take that with a grain of salt,” i remarked sceptically.\\n“all these wills are very confusing. tell me, how did those scribbled\\nwords on the envelope help you to discover that a will was made\\nyesterday afternoon?”\\n\\npoirot smiled.\\n\\n“_mon ami_, have you ever, when writing a letter, been arrested by the\\nfact that you did not know how to spell a certain word?”\\n\\n“yes, often. i suppose everyone has.”\\n\\n“exactly. and have you not, in such a case, tried the word once or\\ntwice on the edge of the blotting-paper, or a spare scrap of paper, to\\nsee if it looked right? well, that is what mrs. inglethorp did. you\\nwill notice that the word ‘possessed’ is spelt first with one ‘s’ and\\nsubsequently with two—correctly. to make sure, she had further tried it\\nin a sentence, thus: ‘i am possessed.’ now, what did that tell me? it\\ntold me that mrs. inglethorp had been writing the word ‘possessed’ that\\nafternoon, and, having the fragment of paper found in the grate fresh\\nin my mind, the possibility of a will—(a document almost certain to\\ncontain that word)—occurred to me at once. this possibility was\\nconfirmed by a further circumstance. in the general confusion, the\\nboudoir had not been swept that morning, and near the desk were several\\ntraces of brown mould and earth. the weather had been perfectly fine\\nfor some days, and no ordinary boots would have left such a heavy\\ndeposit.\\n\\n“i strolled to the window, and saw at once that the begonia beds had\\nbeen newly planted. the mould in the beds was exactly similar to that\\non the floor of the boudoir, and also i learnt from you that they _had_\\nbeen planted yesterday afternoon. i was now sure that one, or possibly\\nboth of the gardeners—for there were two sets of footprints in the\\nbed—had entered the boudoir, for if mrs. inglethorp had merely wished\\nto speak to them she would in all probability have stood at the window,\\nand they would not have come into the room at all. i was now quite\\nconvinced that she had made a fresh will, and had called the two\\ngardeners in to witness her signature. events proved that i was right\\nin my supposition.”\\n\\n“that was very ingenious,” i could not help admitting. “i must confess\\nthat the conclusions i drew from those few scribbled words were quite\\nerroneous.”\\n\\nhe smiled.\\n\\n“you gave too much rein to your imagination. imagination is a good\\nservant, and a bad master. the simplest explanation is always the most\\nlikely.”\\n\\n“another point—how did you know that the key of the despatch-case had\\nbeen lost?”\\n\\n“i did not know it. it was a guess that turned out to be correct. you\\nobserved that it had a piece of twisted wire through the handle. that\\nsuggested to me at once that it had possibly been wrenched off a flimsy\\nkey-ring. now, if it had been lost and recovered, mrs. inglethorp would\\nat once have replaced it on her bunch; but on her bunch i found what\\nwas obviously the duplicate key, very new and bright, which led me to\\nthe hypothesis that somebody else had inserted the original key in the\\nlock of the despatch-case.”\\n\\n“yes,” i said, “alfred inglethorp, without doubt.”\\n\\npoirot looked at me curiously.\\n\\n“you are very sure of his guilt?”\\n\\n“well, naturally. every fresh circumstance seems to establish it more\\nclearly.”\\n\\n“on the contrary,” said poirot quietly, “there are several points in\\nhis favour.”\\n\\n“oh, come now!”\\n\\n“yes.”\\n\\n“i see only one.”\\n\\n“and that?”\\n\\n“that he was not in the house last night.”\\n\\n“‘bad shot!’ as you english say! you have chosen the one point that to\\nmy mind tells against him.”\\n\\n“how is that?”\\n\\n“because if mr. inglethorp knew that his wife would be poisoned last\\nnight, he would certainly have arranged to be away from the house. his\\nexcuse was an obviously trumped up one. that leaves us two\\npossibilities: either he knew what was going to happen or he had a\\nreason of his own for his absence.”\\n\\n“and that reason?” i asked sceptically.\\n\\npoirot shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n“how should i know? discreditable, without doubt. this mr. inglethorp,\\ni should say, is somewhat of a scoundrel—but that does not of necessity\\nmake him a murderer.”\\n\\ni shook my head, unconvinced.\\n\\n“we do not agree, eh?” said poirot. “well, let us leave it. time will\\nshow which of us is right. now let us turn to other aspects of the\\ncase. what do you make of the fact that all the doors of the bedroom\\nwere bolted on the inside?”\\n\\n“well——” i considered. “one must look at it logically.”\\n\\n“true.”\\n\\n“i should put it this way. the doors _were_ bolted—our own eyes have\\ntold us that—yet the presence of the candle grease on the floor, and\\nthe destruction of the will, prove that during the night someone\\nentered the room. you agree so far?”\\n\\n“perfectly. put with admirable clearness. proceed.”\\n\\n“well,” i said, encouraged, “as the person who entered did not do so by\\nthe window, nor by miraculous means, it follows that the door must have\\nbeen opened from inside by mrs. inglethorp herself. that strengthens\\nthe conviction that the person in question was her husband. she would\\nnaturally open the door to her own husband.”\\n\\npoirot shook his head.\\n\\n“why should she? she had bolted the door leading into his room—a most\\nunusual proceeding on her part—she had had a most violent quarrel with\\nhim that very afternoon. no, he was the last person she would admit.”\\n\\n“but you agree with me that the door must have been opened by mrs.\\ninglethorp herself?”\\n\\n“there is another possibility. she may have forgotten to bolt the door\\ninto the passage when she went to bed, and have got up later, towards\\nmorning, and bolted it then.”\\n\\n“poirot, is that seriously your opinion?”\\n\\n“no, i do not say it is so, but it might be. now, to turn to another\\nfeature, what do you make of the scrap of conversation you overheard\\nbetween mrs. cavendish and her mother-in-law?”\\n\\n“i had forgotten that,” i said thoughtfully. “that is as enigmatical as\\never. it seems incredible that a woman like mrs. cavendish, proud and\\nreticent to the last degree, should interfere so violently in what was\\ncertainly not her affair.”\\n\\n“precisely. it was an astonishing thing for a woman of her breeding to\\ndo.”\\n\\n“it is certainly curious,” i agreed. “still, it is unimportant, and\\nneed not be taken into account.”\\n\\na groan burst from poirot.\\n\\n“what have i always told you? everything must be taken into account. if\\nthe fact will not fit the theory—let the theory go.”\\n\\n“well, we shall see,” i said, nettled.\\n\\n“yes, we shall see.”\\n\\nwe had reached leastways cottage, and poirot ushered me upstairs to his\\nown room. he offered me one of the tiny russian cigarettes he himself\\noccasionally smoked. i was amused to notice that he stowed away the\\nused matches most carefully in a little china pot. my momentary\\nannoyance vanished.\\n\\npoirot had placed our two chairs in front of the open window which\\ncommanded a view of the village street. the fresh air blew in warm and\\npleasant. it was going to be a hot day.\\n\\nsuddenly my attention was arrested by a weedy looking young man rushing\\ndown the street at a great pace. it was the expression on his face that\\nwas extraordinary—a curious mingling of terror and agitation.\\n\\n“look, poirot!” i said.\\n\\nhe leant forward.\\n\\n“_tiens!_” he said. “it is mr. mace, from the chemist’s shop. he is\\ncoming here.”\\n\\nthe young man came to a halt before leastways cottage, and, after\\nhesitating a moment, pounded vigorously at the door.\\n\\n“a little minute,” cried poirot from the window. “i come.”\\n\\nmotioning to me to follow him, he ran swiftly down the stairs and\\nopened the door. mr. mace began at once.\\n\\n“oh, mr. poirot, i’m sorry for the inconvenience, but i heard that\\nyou’d just come back from the hall?”\\n\\n“yes, we have.”\\n\\nthe young man moistened his dry lips. his face was working curiously.\\n\\n“it’s all over the village about old mrs. inglethorp dying so suddenly.\\nthey do say—” he lowered his voice cautiously—“that it’s poison?”\\n\\npoirot’s face remained quite impassive.\\n\\n“only the doctors can tell us that, mr. mace.”\\n\\n“yes, exactly—of course——” the young man hesitated, and then his\\nagitation was too much for him. he clutched poirot by the arm, and sank\\nhis voice to a whisper: “just tell me this, mr. poirot, it isn’t—it\\nisn’t strychnine, is it?”\\n\\ni hardly heard what poirot replied. something evidently of a\\nnon-committal nature. the young man departed, and as he closed the door\\npoirot’s eyes met mine.\\n\\n“yes,” he said, nodding gravely. “he will have evidence to give at the\\ninquest.”\\n\\nwe went slowly upstairs again. i was opening my lips, when poirot\\nstopped me with a gesture of his hand.\\n\\n“not now, not now, _mon ami_. i have need of reflection. my mind is in\\nsome disorder—which is not well.”\\n\\nfor about ten minutes he sat in dead silence, perfectly still, except\\nfor several expressive motions of his eyebrows, and all the time his\\neyes grew steadily greener. at last he heaved a deep sigh.\\n\\n“it is well. the bad moment has passed. now all is arranged and\\nclassified. one must never permit confusion. the case is not clear\\nyet—no. for it is of the most complicated! it puzzles _me_. _me_,\\nhercule poirot! there are two facts of significance.”\\n\\n“and what are they?”\\n\\n“the first is the state of the weather yesterday. that is very\\nimportant.”\\n\\n“but it was a glorious day!” i interrupted. “poirot, you’re pulling my\\nleg!”\\n\\n“not at all. the thermometer registered 80 degrees in the shade. do not\\nforget that, my friend. it is the key to the whole riddle!”\\n\\n“and the second point?” i asked.\\n\\n“the important fact that monsieur inglethorp wears very peculiar\\nclothes, has a black beard, and uses glasses.”\\n\\n“poirot, i cannot believe you are serious.”\\n\\n“i am absolutely serious, my friend.”\\n\\n“but this is childish!”\\n\\n“no, it is very momentous.”\\n\\n“and supposing the coroner’s jury returns a verdict of wilful murder\\nagainst alfred inglethorp. what becomes of your theories, then?”\\n\\n“they would not be shaken because twelve stupid men had happened to\\nmake a mistake! but that will not occur. for one thing, a country jury\\nis not anxious to take responsibility upon itself, and mr. inglethorp\\nstands practically in the position of local squire. also,” he added\\nplacidly, “_i_ should not allow it!”\\n\\n“_you_ would not allow it?”\\n\\n“no.”\\n\\ni looked at the extraordinary little man, divided between annoyance and\\namusement. he was so tremendously sure of himself. as though he read my\\nthoughts, he nodded gently.\\n\\n“oh, yes, _mon ami_, i would do what i say.” he got up and laid his\\nhand on my shoulder. his physiognomy underwent a complete change. tears\\ncame into his eyes. “in all this, you see, i think of that poor mrs.\\ninglethorp who is dead. she was not extravagantly loved—no. but she was\\nvery good to us belgians—i owe her a debt.”\\n\\ni endeavoured to interrupt, but poirot swept on.\\n\\n“let me tell you this, hastings. she would never forgive me if i let\\nalfred inglethorp, her husband, be arrested _now_—when a word from me\\ncould save him!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter vi.\\nthe inquest\\n\\n\\nin the interval before the inquest, poirot was unfailing in his\\nactivity. twice he was closeted with mr. wells. he also took long walks\\ninto the country. i rather resented his not taking me into his\\nconfidence, the more so as i could not in the least guess what he was\\ndriving at.\\n\\nit occurred to me that he might have been making inquiries at raikes’s\\nfarm; so, finding him out when i called at leastways cottage on\\nwednesday evening, i walked over there by the fields, hoping to meet\\nhim. but there was no sign of him, and i hesitated to go right up to\\nthe farm itself. as i walked away, i met an aged rustic, who leered at\\nme cunningly.\\n\\n“you’m from the hall, bain’t you?” he asked.\\n\\n“yes. i’m looking for a friend of mine whom i thought might have walked\\nthis way.”\\n\\n“a little chap? as waves his hands when he talks? one of them belgies\\nfrom the village?”\\n\\n“yes,” i said eagerly. “he has been here, then?”\\n\\n“oh, ay, he’s been here, right enough. more’n once too. friend of\\nyours, is he? ah, you gentlemen from the hall—you’m a pretty lot!” and\\nhe leered more jocosely than ever.\\n\\n“why, do the gentlemen from the hall come here often?” i asked, as\\ncarelessly as i could.\\n\\nhe winked at me knowingly.\\n\\n“_one_ does, mister. naming no names, mind. and a very liberal\\ngentleman too! oh, thank you, sir, i’m sure.”\\n\\ni walked on sharply. evelyn howard had been right then, and i\\nexperienced a sharp twinge of disgust, as i thought of alfred\\ninglethorp’s liberality with another woman’s money. had that piquant\\ngipsy face been at the bottom of the crime, or was it the baser\\nmainspring of money? probably a judicious mixture of both.\\n\\non one point, poirot seemed to have a curious obsession. he once or\\ntwice observed to me that he thought dorcas must have made an error in\\nfixing the time of the quarrel. he suggested to her repeatedly that it\\nwas four-thirty, and not four o’clock when she had heard the voices.\\n\\nbut dorcas was unshaken. quite an hour, or even more, had elapsed\\nbetween the time when she had heard the voices and five o’clock, when\\nshe had taken tea to her mistress.\\n\\nthe inquest was held on friday at the stylites arms in the village.\\npoirot and i sat together, not being required to give evidence.\\n\\nthe preliminaries were gone through. the jury viewed the body, and john\\ncavendish gave evidence of identification.\\n\\nfurther questioned, he described his awakening in the early hours of\\nthe morning, and the circumstances of his mother’s death.\\n\\nthe medical evidence was next taken. there was a breathless hush, and\\nevery eye was fixed on the famous london specialist, who was known to\\nbe one of the greatest authorities of the day on the subject of\\ntoxicology.\\n\\nin a few brief words, he summed up the result of the post-mortem. shorn\\nof its medical phraseology and technicalities, it amounted to the fact\\nthat mrs. inglethorp had met her death as the result of strychnine\\npoisoning. judging from the quantity recovered, she must have taken not\\nless than three-quarters of a grain of strychnine, but probably one\\ngrain or slightly over.\\n\\n“is it possible that she could have swallowed the poison by accident?”\\nasked the coroner.\\n\\n“i should consider it very unlikely. strychnine is not used for\\ndomestic purposes, as some poisons are, and there are restrictions\\nplaced on its sale.”\\n\\n“does anything in your examination lead you to determine how the poison\\nwas administered?”\\n\\n“no.”\\n\\n“you arrived at styles before dr. wilkins, i believe?”\\n\\n“that is so. the motor met me just outside the lodge gates, and i\\nhurried there as fast as i could.”\\n\\n“will you relate to us exactly what happened next?”\\n\\n“i entered mrs. inglethorp’s room. she was at that moment in a typical\\ntetanic convulsion. she turned towards me, and gasped out:\\n‘alfred—alfred——’”\\n\\n“could the strychnine have been administered in mrs. inglethorp’s\\nafter-dinner coffee which was taken to her by her husband?”\\n\\n“possibly, but strychnine is a fairly rapid drug in its action. the\\nsymptoms appear from one to two hours after it has been swallowed. it\\nis retarded under certain conditions, none of which, however, appear to\\nhave been present in this case. i presume mrs. inglethorp took the\\ncoffee after dinner about eight o’clock, whereas the symptoms did not\\nmanifest themselves until the early hours of the morning, which, on the\\nface of it, points to the drug having been taken much later in the\\nevening.”\\n\\n“mrs. inglethorp was in the habit of drinking a cup of cocoa in the\\nmiddle of the night. could the strychnine have been administered in\\nthat?”\\n\\n“no, i myself took a sample of the cocoa remaining in the saucepan and\\nhad it analysed. there was no strychnine present.”\\n\\ni heard poirot chuckle softly beside me.\\n\\n“how did you know?” i whispered.\\n\\n“listen.”\\n\\n“i should say”—the doctor was continuing—“that i would have been\\nconsiderably surprised at any other result.”\\n\\n“why?”\\n\\n“simply because strychnine has an unusually bitter taste. it can be\\ndetected in a solution of one in seventy thousand, and can only be\\ndisguised by some strongly flavoured substance. cocoa would be quite\\npowerless to mask it.”\\n\\none of the jury wanted to know if the same objection applied to coffee.\\n\\n“no. coffee has a bitter taste of its own which would probably cover\\nthe taste of strychnine.”\\n\\n“then you consider it more likely that the drug was administered in the\\ncoffee, but that for some unknown reason its action was delayed.”\\n\\n“yes, but, the cup being completely smashed, there is no possibility of\\nanalyzing its contents.”\\n\\nthis concluded dr. bauerstein’s evidence. dr. wilkins corroborated it\\non all points. sounded as to the possibility of suicide, he repudiated\\nit utterly. the deceased, he said, suffered from a weak heart, but\\notherwise enjoyed perfect health, and was of a cheerful and\\nwell-balanced disposition. she would be one of the last people to take\\nher own life.\\n\\nlawrence cavendish was next called. his evidence was quite unimportant,\\nbeing a mere repetition of that of his brother. just as he was about to\\nstep down, he paused, and said rather hesitatingly:\\n\\n“i should like to make a suggestion if i may?”\\n\\nhe glanced deprecatingly at the coroner, who replied briskly:\\n\\n“certainly, mr. cavendish, we are here to arrive at the truth of this\\nmatter, and welcome anything that may lead to further elucidation.”\\n\\n“it is just an idea of mine,” explained lawrence. “of course i may be\\nquite wrong, but it still seems to me that my mother’s death might be\\naccounted for by natural means.”\\n\\n“how do you make that out, mr. cavendish?”\\n\\n“my mother, at the time of her death, and for some time before it, was\\ntaking a tonic containing strychnine.”\\n\\n“ah!” said the coroner.\\n\\nthe jury looked up, interested.\\n\\n“i believe,” continued lawrence, “that there have been cases where the\\ncumulative effect of a drug, administered for some time, has ended by\\ncausing death. also, is it not possible that she may have taken an\\noverdose of her medicine by accident?”\\n\\n“this is the first we have heard of the deceased taking strychnine at\\nthe time of her death. we are much obliged to you, mr. cavendish.”\\n\\ndr. wilkins was recalled and ridiculed the idea.\\n\\n“what mr. cavendish suggests is quite impossible. any doctor would tell\\nyou the same. strychnine is, in a certain sense, a cumulative poison,\\nbut it would be quite impossible for it to result in sudden death in\\nthis way. there would have to be a long period of chronic symptoms\\nwhich would at once have attracted my attention. the whole thing is\\nabsurd.”\\n\\n“and the second suggestion? that mrs. inglethorp may have inadvertently\\ntaken an overdose?”\\n\\n“three, or even four doses, would not have resulted in death. mrs.\\ninglethorp always had an extra large amount of medicine made up at a\\ntime, as she dealt with coot’s, the cash chemists in tadminster. she\\nwould have had to take very nearly the whole bottle to account for the\\namount of strychnine found at the post-mortem.”\\n\\n“then you consider that we may dismiss the tonic as not being in any\\nway instrumental in causing her death?”\\n\\n“certainly. the supposition is ridiculous.”\\n\\nthe same juryman who had interrupted before here suggested that the\\nchemist who made up the medicine might have committed an error.\\n\\n“that, of course, is always possible,” replied the doctor.\\n\\nbut dorcas, who was the next witness called, dispelled even that\\npossibility. the medicine had not been newly made up. on the contrary,\\nmrs. inglethorp had taken the last dose on the day of her death.\\n\\nso the question of the tonic was finally abandoned, and the coroner\\nproceeded with his task. having elicited from dorcas how she had been\\nawakened by the violent ringing of her mistress’s bell, and had\\nsubsequently roused the household, he passed to the subject of the\\nquarrel on the preceding afternoon.\\n\\ndorcas’s evidence on this point was substantially what poirot and i had\\nalready heard, so i will not repeat it here.\\n\\nthe next witness was mary cavendish. she stood very upright, and spoke\\nin a low, clear, and perfectly composed voice. in answer to the\\ncoroner’s question, she told how, her alarm clock having aroused her at\\nfour-thirty as usual, she was dressing, when she was startled by the\\nsound of something heavy falling.\\n\\n“that would have been the table by the bed?” commented the coroner.\\n\\n“i opened my door,” continued mary, “and listened. in a few minutes a\\nbell rang violently. dorcas came running down and woke my husband, and\\nwe all went to my mother-in-law’s room, but it was locked——”\\n\\nthe coroner interrupted her.\\n\\n“i really do not think we need trouble you further on that point. we\\nknow all that can be known of the subsequent happenings. but i should\\nbe obliged if you would tell us all you overheard of the quarrel the\\nday before.”\\n\\n“i?”\\n\\nthere was a faint insolence in her voice. she raised her hand and\\nadjusted the ruffle of lace at her neck, turning her head a little as\\nshe did so. and quite spontaneously the thought flashed across my mind:\\n“she is gaining time!”\\n\\n“yes. i understand,” continued the coroner deliberately, “that you were\\nsitting reading on the bench just outside the long window of the\\nboudoir. that is so, is it not?”\\n\\nthis was news to me and glancing sideways at poirot, i fancied that it\\nwas news to him as well.\\n\\nthere was the faintest pause, the mere hesitation of a moment, before\\nshe answered:\\n\\n“yes, that is so.”\\n\\n“and the boudoir window was open, was it not?”\\n\\nsurely her face grew a little paler as she answered:\\n\\n“yes.”\\n\\n“then you cannot have failed to hear the voices inside, especially as\\nthey were raised in anger. in fact, they would be more audible where\\nyou were than in the hall.”\\n\\n“possibly.”\\n\\n“will you repeat to us what you overheard of the quarrel?”\\n\\n“i really do not remember hearing anything.”\\n\\n“do you mean to say you did not hear voices?”\\n\\n“oh, yes, i heard the voices, but i did not hear what they said.” a\\nfaint spot of colour came into her cheek. “i am not in the habit of\\nlistening to private conversations.”\\n\\nthe coroner persisted.\\n\\n“and you remember nothing at all? _nothing_, mrs. cavendish? not one\\nstray word or phrase to make you realize that it _was_ a private\\nconversation?”\\n\\nshe paused, and seemed to reflect, still outwardly as calm as ever.\\n\\n“yes; i remember. mrs. inglethorp said something—i do not remember\\nexactly what—about causing scandal between husband and wife.”\\n\\n“ah!” the coroner leant back satisfied. “that corresponds with what\\ndorcas heard. but excuse me, mrs. cavendish, although you realized it\\nwas a private conversation, you did not move away? you remained where\\nyou were?”\\n\\ni caught the momentary gleam of her tawny eyes as she raised them. i\\nfelt certain that at that moment she would willingly have torn the\\nlittle lawyer, with his insinuations, into pieces, but she replied\\nquietly enough:\\n\\n“no. i was very comfortable where i was. i fixed my mind on my book.”\\n\\n“and that is all you can tell us?”\\n\\n“that is all.”\\n\\nthe examination was over, though i doubted if the coroner was entirely\\nsatisfied with it. i think he suspected that mary cavendish could tell\\nmore if she chose.\\n\\namy hill, shop assistant, was next called, and deposed to having sold a\\nwill form on the afternoon of the 17th to william earl, under-gardener\\nat styles.\\n\\nwilliam earl and manning succeeded her, and testified to witnessing a\\ndocument. manning fixed the time at about four-thirty, william was of\\nthe opinion that it was rather earlier.\\n\\ncynthia murdoch came next. she had, however, little to tell. she had\\nknown nothing of the tragedy, until awakened by mrs. cavendish.\\n\\n“you did not hear the table fall?”\\n\\n“no. i was fast asleep.”\\n\\nthe coroner smiled.\\n\\n“a good conscience makes a sound sleeper,” he observed. “thank you,\\nmiss murdoch, that is all.”\\n\\n“miss howard.”\\n\\nmiss howard produced the letter written to her by mrs. inglethorp on\\nthe evening of the 17th. poirot and i had, of course already seen it.\\nit added nothing to our knowledge of the tragedy. the following is a\\nfacsimile:\\n\\nstyles court\\nessex\\nhand written note:\\n\\n     july 17th\\n     my dear evelyn\\n     can we not bury\\n     the hachet? i have\\n     found it hard to forgive\\n     the things you said\\n     against my dear husband\\n     but i am an old woman\\n     & very fond of you\\n     yours affectionately,\\n    emily inglethorpe\\n\\n\\nit was handed to the jury who scrutinized it attentively.\\n\\n“i fear it does not help us much,” said the coroner, with a sigh.\\n“there is no mention of any of the events of that afternoon.”\\n\\n“plain as a pikestaff to me,” said miss howard shortly. “it shows\\nclearly enough that my poor old friend had just found out she’d been\\nmade a fool of!”\\n\\n“it says nothing of the kind in the letter,” the coroner pointed out.\\n\\n“no, because emily never could bear to put herself in the wrong. but\\n_i_ know her. she wanted me back. but she wasn’t going to own that i’d\\nbeen right. she went round about. most people do. don’t believe in it\\nmyself.”\\n\\nmr. wells smiled faintly. so, i noticed, did several of the jury. miss\\nhoward was obviously quite a public character.\\n\\n“anyway, all this tomfoolery is a great waste of time,” continued the\\nlady, glancing up and down the jury disparagingly. “talk—talk—talk!\\nwhen all the time we know perfectly well——”\\n\\nthe coroner interrupted her in an agony of apprehension:\\n\\n“thank you, miss howard, that is all.”\\n\\ni fancy he breathed a sigh of relief when she complied.\\n\\nthen came the sensation of the day. the coroner called albert mace,\\nchemist’s assistant.\\n\\nit was our agitated young man of the pale face. in answer to the\\ncoroner’s questions, he explained that he was a qualified pharmacist,\\nbut had only recently come to this particular shop, as the assistant\\nformerly there had just been called up for the army.\\n\\nthese preliminaries completed, the coroner proceeded to business.\\n\\n“mr. mace, have you lately sold strychnine to any unauthorized person?”\\n\\n“yes, sir.”\\n\\n“when was this?”\\n\\n“last monday night.”\\n\\n“monday? not tuesday?”\\n\\n“no, sir, monday, the 16th.”\\n\\n“will you tell us to whom you sold it?”\\n\\nyou could have heard a pin drop.\\n\\n“yes, sir. it was to mr. inglethorp.”\\n\\nevery eye turned simultaneously to where alfred inglethorp was sitting,\\nimpassive and wooden. he started slightly, as the damning words fell\\nfrom the young man’s lips. i half thought he was going to rise from his\\nchair, but he remained seated, although a remarkably well acted\\nexpression of astonishment rose on his face.\\n\\n“you are sure of what you say?” asked the coroner sternly.\\n\\n“quite sure, sir.”\\n\\n“are you in the habit of selling strychnine indiscriminately over the\\ncounter?”\\n\\nthe wretched young man wilted visibly under the coroner’s frown.\\n\\n“oh, no, sir—of course not. but, seeing it was mr. inglethorp of the\\nhall, i thought there was no harm in it. he said it was to poison a\\ndog.”\\n\\ninwardly i sympathized. it was only human nature to endeavour to please\\n“the hall”—especially when it might result in custom being transferred\\nfrom coot’s to the local establishment.\\n\\n“is it not customary for anyone purchasing poison to sign a book?”\\n\\n“yes, sir, mr. inglethorp did so.”\\n\\n“have you got the book here?”\\n\\n“yes, sir.”\\n\\nit was produced; and, with a few words of stern censure, the coroner\\ndismissed the wretched mr. mace.\\n\\nthen, amidst a breathless silence, alfred inglethorp was called. did he\\nrealize, i wondered, how closely the halter was being drawn around his\\nneck?\\n\\nthe coroner went straight to the point.\\n\\n“on monday evening last, did you purchase strychnine for the purpose of\\npoisoning a dog?”\\n\\ninglethorp replied with perfect calmness:\\n\\n“no, i did not. there is no dog at styles, except an outdoor sheepdog,\\nwhich is in perfect health.”\\n\\n“you deny absolutely having purchased strychnine from albert mace on\\nmonday last?”\\n\\n“i do.”\\n\\n“do you also deny _this_?”\\n\\nthe coroner handed him the register in which his signature was\\ninscribed.\\n\\n“certainly i do. the hand-writing is quite different from mine. i will\\nshow you.”\\n\\nhe took an old envelope out of his pocket, and wrote his name on it,\\nhanding it to the jury. it was certainly utterly dissimilar.\\n\\n“then what is your explanation of mr. mace’s statement?”\\n\\nalfred inglethorp replied imperturbably:\\n\\n“mr. mace must have been mistaken.”\\n\\nthe coroner hesitated for a moment, and then said:\\n\\n“mr. inglethorp, as a mere matter of form, would you mind telling us\\nwhere you were on the evening of monday, july 16th?”\\n\\n“really—i cannot remember.”\\n\\n“that is absurd, mr. inglethorp,” said the coroner sharply. “think\\nagain.”\\n\\ninglethorp shook his head.\\n\\n“i cannot tell you. i have an idea that i was out walking.”\\n\\n“in what direction?”\\n\\n“i really can’t remember.”\\n\\nthe coroner’s face grew graver.\\n\\n“were you in company with anyone?”\\n\\n“no.”\\n\\n“did you meet anyone on your walk?”\\n\\n“no.”\\n\\n“that is a pity,” said the coroner dryly. “i am to take it then that\\nyou decline to say where you were at the time that mr. mace positively\\nrecognized you as entering the shop to purchase strychnine?”\\n\\n“if you like to take it that way, yes.”\\n\\n“be careful, mr. inglethorp.”\\n\\npoirot was fidgeting nervously.\\n\\n“_sacré!_” he murmured. “does this imbecile of a man _want_ to be\\narrested?”\\n\\ninglethorp was indeed creating a bad impression. his futile denials\\nwould not have convinced a child. the coroner, however, passed briskly\\nto the next point, and poirot drew a deep breath of relief.\\n\\n“you had a discussion with your wife on tuesday afternoon?”\\n\\n“pardon me,” interrupted alfred inglethorp, “you have been misinformed.\\ni had no quarrel with my dear wife. the whole story is absolutely\\nuntrue. i was absent from the house the entire afternoon.”\\n\\n“have you anyone who can testify to that?”\\n\\n“you have my word,” said inglethorp haughtily.\\n\\nthe coroner did not trouble to reply.\\n\\n“there are two witnesses who will swear to having heard your\\ndisagreement with mrs. inglethorp.”\\n\\n“those witnesses were mistaken.”\\n\\ni was puzzled. the man spoke with such quiet assurance that i was\\nstaggered. i looked at poirot. there was an expression of exultation on\\nhis face which i could not understand. was he at last convinced of\\nalfred inglethorp’s guilt?\\n\\n“mr. inglethorp,” said the coroner, “you have heard your wife’s dying\\nwords repeated here. can you explain them in any way?”\\n\\n“certainly i can.”\\n\\n“you can?”\\n\\n“it seems to me very simple. the room was dimly lighted. dr. bauerstein\\nis much of my height and build, and, like me, wears a beard. in the dim\\nlight, and suffering as she was, my poor wife mistook him for me.”\\n\\n“ah!” murmured poirot to himself. “but it is an idea, that!”\\n\\n“you think it is true?” i whispered.\\n\\n“i do not say that. but it is truly an ingenious supposition.”\\n\\n“you read my wife’s last words as an accusation”—inglethorp was\\ncontinuing—“they were, on the contrary, an appeal to me.”\\n\\nthe coroner reflected a moment, then he said:\\n\\n“i believe, mr. inglethorp, that you yourself poured out the coffee,\\nand took it to your wife that evening?”\\n\\n“i poured it out, yes. but i did not take it to her. i meant to do so,\\nbut i was told that a friend was at the hall door, so i laid down the\\ncoffee on the hall table. when i came through the hall again a few\\nminutes later, it was gone.”\\n\\nthis statement might, or might not, be true, but it did not seem to me\\nto improve matters much for inglethorp. in any case, he had had ample\\ntime to introduce the poison.\\n\\nat that point, poirot nudged me gently, indicating two men who were\\nsitting together near the door. one was a little, sharp, dark,\\nferret-faced man, the other was tall and fair.\\n\\ni questioned poirot mutely. he put his lips to my ear.\\n\\n“do you know who that little man is?”\\n\\ni shook my head.\\n\\n“that is detective inspector james japp of scotland yard—jimmy japp.\\nthe other man is from scotland yard too. things are moving quickly, my\\nfriend.”\\n\\ni stared at the two men intently. there was certainly nothing of the\\npoliceman about them. i should never have suspected them of being\\nofficial personages.\\n\\ni was still staring, when i was startled and recalled by the verdict\\nbeing given:\\n\\n“wilful murder against some person or persons unknown.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter vii.\\npoirot pays his debts\\n\\n\\nas we came out of the stylites arms, poirot drew me aside by a gentle\\npressure of the arm. i understood his object. he was waiting for the\\nscotland yard men.\\n\\nin a few moments, they emerged, and poirot at once stepped forward, and\\naccosted the shorter of the two.\\n\\n“i fear you do not remember me, inspector japp.”\\n\\n“why, if it isn’t mr. poirot!” cried the inspector. he turned to the\\nother man. “you’ve heard me speak of mr. poirot? it was in 1904 he and\\ni worked together—the abercrombie forgery case—you remember, he was run\\ndown in brussels. ah, those were great days, moosier. then, do you\\nremember ‘baron’ altara? there was a pretty rogue for you! he eluded\\nthe clutches of half the police in europe. but we nailed him in\\nantwerp—thanks to mr. poirot here.”\\n\\nas these friendly reminiscences were being indulged in, i drew nearer,\\nand was introduced to detective-inspector japp, who, in his turn,\\nintroduced us both to his companion, superintendent summerhaye.\\n\\n“i need hardly ask what you are doing here, gentlemen,” remarked\\npoirot.\\n\\njapp closed one eye knowingly.\\n\\n“no, indeed. pretty clear case i should say.”\\n\\nbut poirot answered gravely:\\n\\n“there i differ from you.”\\n\\n“oh, come!” said summerhaye, opening his lips for the first time.\\n“surely the whole thing is clear as daylight. the man’s caught\\nred-handed. how he could be such a fool beats me!”\\n\\nbut japp was looking attentively at poirot.\\n\\n“hold your fire, summerhaye,” he remarked jocularly. “me and moosier\\nhere have met before—and there’s no man’s judgment i’d sooner take than\\nhis. if i’m not greatly mistaken, he’s got something up his sleeve.\\nisn’t that so, moosier?”\\n\\npoirot smiled.\\n\\n“i have drawn certain conclusions—yes.”\\n\\nsummerhaye was still looking rather sceptical, but japp continued his\\nscrutiny of poirot.\\n\\n“it’s this way,” he said, “so far, we’ve only seen the case from the\\noutside. that’s where the yard’s at a disadvantage in a case of this\\nkind, where the murder’s only out, so to speak, after the inquest. a\\nlot depends on being on the spot first thing, and that’s where mr.\\npoirot’s had the start of us. we shouldn’t have been here as soon as\\nthis even, if it hadn’t been for the fact that there was a smart doctor\\non the spot, who gave us the tip through the coroner. but you’ve been\\non the spot from the first, and you may have picked up some little\\nhints. from the evidence at the inquest, mr. inglethorp murdered his\\nwife as sure as i stand here, and if anyone but you hinted the contrary\\ni’d laugh in his face. i must say i was surprised the jury didn’t bring\\nit in wilful murder against him right off. i think they would have, if\\nit hadn’t been for the coroner—he seemed to be holding them back.”\\n\\n“perhaps, though, you have a warrant for his arrest in your pocket\\nnow,” suggested poirot.\\n\\na kind of wooden shutter of officialdom came down from japp’s\\nexpressive countenance.\\n\\n“perhaps i have, and perhaps i haven’t,” he remarked dryly.\\n\\npoirot looked at him thoughtfully.\\n\\n“i am very anxious, messieurs, that he should not be arrested.”\\n\\n“i dare say,” observed summerhaye sarcastically.\\n\\njapp was regarding poirot with comical perplexity.\\n\\n“can’t you go a little further, mr. poirot? a wink’s as good as a\\nnod—from you. you’ve been on the spot—and the yard doesn’t want to make\\nany mistakes, you know.”\\n\\npoirot nodded gravely.\\n\\n“that is exactly what i thought. well, i will tell you this. use your\\nwarrant: arrest mr. inglethorp. but it will bring you no kudos—the case\\nagainst him will be dismissed at once! _comme ça!_” and he snapped his\\nfingers expressively.\\n\\njapp’s face grew grave, though summerhaye gave an incredulous snort.\\n\\nas for me, i was literally dumb with astonishment. i could only\\nconclude that poirot was mad.\\n\\njapp had taken out a handkerchief, and was gently dabbing his brow.\\n\\n“i daren’t do it, mr. poirot. _i_’d take your word, but there’s others\\nover me who’ll be asking what the devil i mean by it. can’t you give me\\na little more to go on?”\\n\\npoirot reflected a moment.\\n\\n“it can be done,” he said at last. “i admit i do not wish it. it forces\\nmy hand. i would have preferred to work in the dark just for the\\npresent, but what you say is very just—the word of a belgian policeman,\\nwhose day is past, is not enough! and alfred inglethorp must not be\\narrested. that i have sworn, as my friend hastings here knows. see,\\nthen, my good japp, you go at once to styles?”\\n\\n“well, in about half an hour. we’re seeing the coroner and the doctor\\nfirst.”\\n\\n“good. call for me in passing—the last house in the village. i will go\\nwith you. at styles, mr. inglethorp will give you, or if he refuses—as\\nis probable—i will give you such proofs that shall satisfy you that the\\ncase against him could not possibly be sustained. is that a bargain?”\\n\\n“that’s a bargain,” said japp heartily. “and, on behalf of the yard,\\ni’m much obliged to you, though i’m bound to confess i can’t at present\\nsee the faintest possible loop-hole in the evidence, but you always\\nwere a marvel! so long, then, moosier.”\\n\\nthe two detectives strode away, summerhaye with an incredulous grin on\\nhis face.\\n\\n“well, my friend,” cried poirot, before i could get in a word, “what do\\nyou think? _mon dieu!_ i had some warm moments in that court; i did not\\nfigure to myself that the man would be so pig-headed as to refuse to\\nsay anything at all. decidedly, it was the policy of an imbecile.”\\n\\n“h’m! there are other explanations besides that of imbecility,” i\\nremarked. “for, if the case against him is true, how could he defend\\nhimself except by silence?”\\n\\n“why, in a thousand ingenious ways,” cried poirot. “see; say that it is\\ni who have committed this murder, i can think of seven most plausible\\nstories! far more convincing than mr. inglethorp’s stony denials!”\\n\\ni could not help laughing.\\n\\n“my dear poirot, i am sure you are capable of thinking of seventy! but,\\nseriously, in spite of what i heard you say to the detectives, you\\nsurely cannot still believe in the possibility of alfred inglethorp’s\\ninnocence?”\\n\\n“why not now as much as before? nothing has changed.”\\n\\n“but the evidence is so conclusive.”\\n\\n“yes, too conclusive.”\\n\\nwe turned in at the gate of leastways cottage, and proceeded up the now\\nfamiliar stairs.\\n\\n“yes, yes, too conclusive,” continued poirot, almost to himself. “real\\nevidence is usually vague and unsatisfactory. it has to be\\nexamined—sifted. but here the whole thing is cut and dried. no, my\\nfriend, this evidence has been very cleverly manufactured—so cleverly\\nthat it has defeated its own ends.”\\n\\n“how do you make that out?”\\n\\n“because, so long as the evidence against him was vague and intangible,\\nit was very hard to disprove. but, in his anxiety, the criminal has\\ndrawn the net so closely that one cut will set inglethorp free.”\\n\\ni was silent. and in a minute or two, poirot continued:\\n\\n“let us look at the matter like this. here is a man, let us say, who\\nsets out to poison his wife. he has lived by his wits as the saying\\ngoes. presumably, therefore, he has some wits. he is not altogether a\\nfool. well, how does he set about it? he goes boldly to the village\\nchemist’s and purchases strychnine under his own name, with a trumped\\nup story about a dog which is bound to be proved absurd. he does not\\nemploy the poison that night. no, he waits until he has had a violent\\nquarrel with her, of which the whole household is cognisant, and which\\nnaturally directs their suspicions upon him. he prepares no defence—no\\nshadow of an alibi, yet he knows the chemist’s assistant must\\nnecessarily come forward with the facts. bah! do not ask me to believe\\nthat any man could be so idiotic! only a lunatic, who wished to commit\\nsuicide by causing himself to be hanged, would act so!”\\n\\n“still—i do not see——” i began.\\n\\n“neither do i see. i tell you, _mon ami_, it puzzles me. _me_—hercule\\npoirot!”\\n\\n“but if you believe him innocent, how do you explain his buying the\\nstrychnine?”\\n\\n“very simply. he did _not_ buy it.”\\n\\n“but mace recognized him!”\\n\\n“i beg your pardon, he saw a man with a black beard like mr.\\ninglethorp’s, and wearing glasses like mr. inglethorp, and dressed in\\nmr. inglethorp’s rather noticeable clothes. he could not recognize a\\nman whom he had probably only seen in the distance, since, you\\nremember, he himself had only been in the village a fortnight, and mrs.\\ninglethorp dealt principally with coot’s in tadminster.”\\n\\n“then you think——”\\n\\n“_mon ami_, do you remember the two points i laid stress upon? leave\\nthe first one for the moment, what was the second?”\\n\\n“the important fact that alfred inglethorp wears peculiar clothes, has\\na black beard, and uses glasses,” i quoted.\\n\\n“exactly. now suppose anyone wished to pass himself off as john or\\nlawrence cavendish. would it be easy?”\\n\\n“no,” i said thoughtfully. “of course an actor——”\\n\\nbut poirot cut me short ruthlessly.\\n\\n“and why would it not be easy? i will tell you, my friend: because they\\nare both clean-shaven men. to make up successfully as one of these two\\nin broad daylight, it would need an actor of genius, and a certain\\ninitial facial resemblance. but in the case of alfred inglethorp, all\\nthat is changed. his clothes, his beard, the glasses which hide his\\neyes—those are the salient points about his personal appearance. now,\\nwhat is the first instinct of the criminal? to divert suspicion from\\nhimself, is it not so? and how can he best do that? by throwing it on\\nsomeone else. in this instance, there was a man ready to his hand.\\neverybody was predisposed to believe in mr. inglethorp’s guilt. it was\\na foregone conclusion that he would be suspected; but, to make it a\\nsure thing there must be tangible proof—such as the actual buying of\\nthe poison, and that, with a man of the peculiar appearance of mr.\\ninglethorp, was not difficult. remember, this young mace had never\\nactually spoken to mr. inglethorp. how should he doubt that the man in\\nhis clothes, with his beard and his glasses, was not alfred\\ninglethorp?”\\n\\n“it may be so,” i said, fascinated by poirot’s eloquence. “but, if that\\nwas the case, why does he not say where he was at six o’clock on monday\\nevening?”\\n\\n“ah, why indeed?” said poirot, calming down. “if he were arrested, he\\nprobably would speak, but i do not want it to come to that. i must make\\nhim see the gravity of his position. there is, of course, something\\ndiscreditable behind his silence. if he did not murder his wife, he is,\\nnevertheless, a scoundrel, and has something of his own to conceal,\\nquite apart from the murder.”\\n\\n“what can it be?” i mused, won over to poirot’s views for the moment,\\nalthough still retaining a faint conviction that the obvious deduction\\nwas the correct one.\\n\\n“can you not guess?” asked poirot, smiling.\\n\\n“no, can you?”\\n\\n“oh, yes, i had a little idea sometime ago—and it has turned out to be\\ncorrect.”\\n\\n“you never told me,” i said reproachfully.\\n\\npoirot spread out his hands apologetically.\\n\\n“pardon me, _mon ami_, you were not precisely _sympathique_.” he turned\\nto me earnestly. “tell me—you see now that he must not be arrested?”\\n\\n“perhaps,” i said doubtfully, for i was really quite indifferent to the\\nfate of alfred inglethorp, and thought that a good fright would do him\\nno harm.\\n\\npoirot, who was watching me intently, gave a sigh.\\n\\n“come, my friend,” he said, changing the subject, “apart from mr.\\ninglethorp, how did the evidence at the inquest strike you?”\\n\\n“oh, pretty much what i expected.”\\n\\n“did nothing strike you as peculiar about it?”\\n\\nmy thoughts flew to mary cavendish, and i hedged:\\n\\n“in what way?”\\n\\n“well, mr. lawrence cavendish’s evidence for instance?”\\n\\ni was relieved.\\n\\n“oh, lawrence! no, i don’t think so. he’s always a nervous chap.”\\n\\n“his suggestion that his mother might have been poisoned accidentally\\nby means of the tonic she was taking, that did not strike you as\\nstrange— _hein?_”\\n\\n“no, i can’t say it did. the doctors ridiculed it of course. but it was\\nquite a natural suggestion for a layman to make.”\\n\\n“but monsieur lawrence is not a layman. you told me yourself that he\\nhad started by studying medicine, and that he had taken his degree.”\\n\\n“yes, that’s true. i never thought of that.” i was rather startled. “it\\n_is_ odd.”\\n\\npoirot nodded.\\n\\n“from the first, his behaviour has been peculiar. of all the household,\\nhe alone would be likely to recognize the symptoms of strychnine\\npoisoning, and yet we find him the only member of the family to uphold\\nstrenuously the theory of death from natural causes. if it had been\\nmonsieur john, i could have understood it. he has no technical\\nknowledge, and is by nature unimaginative. but monsieur lawrence—no!\\nand now, to-day, he puts forward a suggestion that he himself must have\\nknown was ridiculous. there is food for thought in this, _mon ami!_”\\n\\n“it’s very confusing,” i agreed.\\n\\n“then there is mrs. cavendish,” continued poirot. “that’s another who\\nis not telling all she knows! what do you make of her attitude?”\\n\\n“i don’t know what to make of it. it seems inconceivable that she\\nshould be shielding alfred inglethorp. yet that is what it looks like.”\\n\\npoirot nodded reflectively.\\n\\n“yes, it is queer. one thing is certain, she overheard a good deal more\\nof that ‘private conversation’ than she was willing to admit.”\\n\\n“and yet she is the last person one would accuse of stooping to\\neavesdrop!”\\n\\n“exactly. one thing her evidence _has_ shown me. i made a mistake.\\ndorcas was quite right. the quarrel did take place earlier in the\\nafternoon, about four o’clock, as she said.”\\n\\ni looked at him curiously. i had never understood his insistence on\\nthat point.\\n\\n“yes, a good deal that was peculiar came out to-day,” continued poirot.\\n“dr. bauerstein, now, what was _he_ doing up and dressed at that hour\\nin the morning? it is astonishing to me that no one commented on the\\nfact.”\\n\\n“he has insomnia, i believe,” i said doubtfully.\\n\\n“which is a very good, or a very bad explanation,” remarked poirot. “it\\ncovers everything, and explains nothing. i shall keep my eye on our\\nclever dr. bauerstein.”\\n\\n“any more faults to find with the evidence?” i inquired satirically.\\n\\n“_mon ami_,” replied poirot gravely, “when you find that people are not\\ntelling you the truth—look out! now, unless i am much mistaken, at the\\ninquest to-day only one—at most, two persons were speaking the truth\\nwithout reservation or subterfuge.”\\n\\n“oh, come now, poirot! i won’t cite lawrence, or mrs. cavendish. but\\nthere’s john—and miss howard, surely they were speaking the truth?”\\n\\n“both of them, my friend? one, i grant you, but both——!”\\n\\nhis words gave me an unpleasant shock. miss howard’s evidence,\\nunimportant as it was, had been given in such a downright\\nstraightforward manner that it had never occurred to me to doubt her\\nsincerity. still, i had a great respect for poirot’s sagacity—except on\\nthe occasions when he was what i described to myself as “foolishly\\npig-headed.”\\n\\n“do you really think so?” i asked. “miss howard had always seemed to me\\nso essentially honest—almost uncomfortably so.”\\n\\npoirot gave me a curious look, which i could not quite fathom. he\\nseemed to speak, and then checked himself.\\n\\n“miss murdoch too,” i continued, “there’s nothing untruthful about\\n_her_.”\\n\\n“no. but it was strange that she never heard a sound, sleeping next\\ndoor; whereas mrs. cavendish, in the other wing of the building,\\ndistinctly heard the table fall.”\\n\\n“well, she’s young. and she sleeps soundly.”\\n\\n“ah, yes, indeed! she must be a famous sleeper, that one!”\\n\\ni did not quite like the tone of his voice, but at that moment a smart\\nknock reached our ears, and looking out of the window we perceived the\\ntwo detectives waiting for us below.\\n\\npoirot seized his hat, gave a ferocious twist to his moustache, and,\\ncarefully brushing an imaginary speck of dust from his sleeve, motioned\\nme to precede him down the stairs; there we joined the detectives and\\nset out for styles.\\n\\ni think the appearance of the two scotland yard men was rather a\\nshock—especially to john, though of course after the verdict, he had\\nrealized that it was only a matter of time. still, the presence of the\\ndetectives brought the truth home to him more than anything else could\\nhave done.\\n\\npoirot had conferred with japp in a low tone on the way up, and it was\\nthe latter functionary who requested that the household, with the\\nexception of the servants, should be assembled together in the\\ndrawing-room. i realized the significance of this. it was up to poirot\\nto make his boast good.\\n\\npersonally, i was not sanguine. poirot might have excellent reasons for\\nhis belief in inglethorp’s innocence, but a man of the type of\\nsummerhaye would require tangible proofs, and these i doubted if poirot\\ncould supply.\\n\\nbefore very long we had all trooped into the drawing-room, the door of\\nwhich japp closed. poirot politely set chairs for everyone. the\\nscotland yard men were the cynosure of all eyes. i think that for the\\nfirst time we realized that the thing was not a bad dream, but a\\ntangible reality. we had read of such things—now we ourselves were\\nactors in the drama. to-morrow the daily papers, all over england,\\nwould blazon out the news in staring headlines:\\n\\n“mysterious tragedy in essex”\\n\\n    “wealthy lady poisoned”\\n\\n\\nthere would be pictures of styles, snap-shots of “the family leaving\\nthe inquest”—the village photographer had not been idle! all the things\\nthat one had read a hundred times—things that happen to other people,\\nnot to oneself. and now, in this house, a murder had been committed. in\\nfront of us were “the detectives in charge of the case.” the well-known\\nglib phraseology passed rapidly through my mind in the interval before\\npoirot opened the proceedings.\\n\\ni think everyone was a little surprised that it should be he and not\\none of the official detectives who took the initiative.\\n\\n“_mesdames_ and _messieurs_,” said poirot, bowing as though he were a\\ncelebrity about to deliver a lecture, “i have asked you to come here\\nall together, for a certain object. that object, it concerns mr. alfred\\ninglethorp.”\\n\\ninglethorp was sitting a little by himself—i think, unconsciously,\\neveryone had drawn his chair slightly away from him—and he gave a faint\\nstart as poirot pronounced his name.\\n\\n“mr. inglethorp,” said poirot, addressing him directly, “a very dark\\nshadow is resting on this house—the shadow of murder.”\\n\\ninglethorp shook his head sadly.\\n\\n“my poor wife,” he murmured. “poor emily! it is terrible.”\\n\\n“i do not think, monsieur,” said poirot pointedly, “that you quite\\nrealize how terrible it may be—for you.” and as inglethorp did not\\nappear to understand, he added: “mr. inglethorp, you are standing in\\nvery grave danger.”\\n\\nthe two detectives fidgeted. i saw the official caution “anything you\\nsay will be used in evidence against you,” actually hovering on\\nsummerhaye’s lips. poirot went on.\\n\\n“do you understand now, monsieur?”\\n\\n“no. what do you mean?”\\n\\n“i mean,” said poirot deliberately, “that you are suspected of\\npoisoning your wife.”\\n\\na little gasp ran round the circle at this plain speaking.\\n\\n“good heavens!” cried inglethorp, starting up. “what a monstrous idea!\\n_i_—poison my dearest emily!”\\n\\n“i do not think”—poirot watched him narrowly—“that you quite realize\\nthe unfavourable nature of your evidence at the inquest. mr.\\ninglethorp, knowing what i have now told you, do you still refuse to\\nsay where you were at six o’clock on monday afternoon?”\\n\\nwith a groan, alfred inglethorp sank down again and buried his face in\\nhis hands. poirot approached and stood over him.\\n\\n“speak!” he cried menacingly.\\n\\nwith an effort, inglethorp raised his face from his hands. then, slowly\\nand deliberately, he shook his head.\\n\\n“you will not speak?”\\n\\n“no. i do not believe that anyone could be so monstrous as to accuse me\\nof what you say.”\\n\\npoirot nodded thoughtfully, like a man whose mind is made up.\\n\\n“_soit!_” he said. “then i must speak for you.”\\n\\nalfred inglethorp sprang up again.\\n\\n“you? how can you speak? you do not know——” he broke off abruptly.\\n\\npoirot turned to face us. “_mesdames_ and _messieurs_! i speak! listen!\\ni, hercule poirot, affirm that the man who entered the chemist’s shop,\\nand purchased strychnine at six o’clock on monday last was not mr.\\ninglethorp, for at six o’clock on that day mr. inglethorp was escorting\\nmrs. raikes back to her home from a neighbouring farm. i can produce no\\nless than five witnesses to swear to having seen them together, either\\nat six or just after and, as you may know, the abbey farm, mrs.\\nraikes’s home, is at least two and a half miles distant from the\\nvillage. there is absolutely no question as to the alibi!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter viii.\\nfresh suspicions\\n\\n\\nthere was a moment’s stupefied silence. japp, who was the least\\nsurprised of any of us, was the first to speak.\\n\\n“my word,” he cried, “you’re the goods! and no mistake, mr. poirot!\\nthese witnesses of yours are all right, i suppose?”\\n\\n“_voilà!_ i have prepared a list of them—names and addresses. you must\\nsee them, of course. but you will find it all right.”\\n\\n“i’m sure of that.” japp lowered his voice. “i’m much obliged to you. a\\npretty mare’s nest arresting him would have been.” he turned to\\ninglethorp. “but, if you’ll excuse me, sir, why couldn’t you say all\\nthis at the inquest?”\\n\\n“i will tell you why,” interrupted poirot. “there was a certain\\nrumour——”\\n\\n“a most malicious and utterly untrue one,” interrupted alfred\\ninglethorp in an agitated voice.\\n\\n“and mr. inglethorp was anxious to have no scandal revived just at\\npresent. am i right?”\\n\\n“quite right.” inglethorp nodded. “with my poor emily not yet buried,\\ncan you wonder i was anxious that no more lying rumours should be\\nstarted.”\\n\\n“between you and me, sir,” remarked japp, “i’d sooner have any amount\\nof rumours than be arrested for murder. and i venture to think your\\npoor lady would have felt the same. and, if it hadn’t been for mr.\\npoirot here, arrested you would have been, as sure as eggs is eggs!”\\n\\n“i was foolish, no doubt,” murmured inglethorp. “but you do not know,\\ninspector, how i have been persecuted and maligned.” and he shot a\\nbaleful glance at evelyn howard.\\n\\n“now, sir,” said japp, turning briskly to john, “i should like to see\\nthe lady’s bedroom, please, and after that i’ll have a little chat with\\nthe servants. don’t you bother about anything. mr. poirot, here, will\\nshow me the way.”\\n\\nas they all went out of the room, poirot turned and made me a sign to\\nfollow him upstairs. there he caught me by the arm, and drew me aside.\\n\\n“quick, go to the other wing. stand there—just this side of the baize\\ndoor. do not move till i come.” then, turning rapidly, he rejoined the\\ntwo detectives.\\n\\ni followed his instructions, taking up my position by the baize door,\\nand wondering what on earth lay behind the request. why was i to stand\\nin this particular spot on guard? i looked thoughtfully down the\\ncorridor in front of me. an idea struck me. with the exception of\\ncynthia murdoch’s, everyone’s room was in this left wing. had that\\nanything to do with it? was i to report who came or went? i stood\\nfaithfully at my post. the minutes passed. nobody came. nothing\\nhappened.\\n\\nit must have been quite twenty minutes before poirot rejoined me.\\n\\n“you have not stirred?”\\n\\n“no, i’ve stuck here like a rock. nothing’s happened.”\\n\\n“ah!” was he pleased, or disappointed? “you’ve seen nothing at all?”\\n\\n“no.”\\n\\n“but you have probably heard something? a big bump—eh, _mon ami?_”\\n\\n“no.”\\n\\n“is it possible? ah, but i am vexed with myself! i am not usually\\nclumsy. i made but a slight gesture”—i know poirot’s gestures—“with the\\nleft hand, and over went the table by the bed!”\\n\\nhe looked so childishly vexed and crest-fallen that i hastened to\\nconsole him.\\n\\n“never mind, old chap. what does it matter? your triumph downstairs\\nexcited you. i can tell you, that was a surprise to us all. there must\\nbe more in this affair of inglethorp’s with mrs. raikes than we\\nthought, to make him hold his tongue so persistently. what are you\\ngoing to do now? where are the scotland yard fellows?”\\n\\n“gone down to interview the servants. i showed them all our exhibits. i\\nam disappointed in japp. he has no method!”\\n\\n“hullo!” i said, looking out of the window. “here’s dr. bauerstein. i\\nbelieve you’re right about that man, poirot. i don’t like him.”\\n\\n“he is clever,” observed poirot meditatively.\\n\\n“oh, clever as the devil! i must say i was overjoyed to see him in the\\nplight he was in on tuesday. you never saw such a spectacle!” and i\\ndescribed the doctor’s adventure. “he looked a regular scarecrow!\\nplastered with mud from head to foot.”\\n\\n“you saw him, then?”\\n\\n“yes. of course, he didn’t want to come in—it was just after dinner—but\\nmr. inglethorp insisted.”\\n\\n“what?” poirot caught me violently by the shoulders. “was dr.\\nbauerstein here on tuesday evening? here? and you never told me? why\\ndid you not tell me? why? why?”\\n\\nhe appeared to be in an absolute frenzy.\\n\\n“my dear poirot,” i expostulated, “i never thought it would interest\\nyou. i didn’t know it was of any importance.”\\n\\n“importance? it is of the first importance! so dr. bauerstein was here\\non tuesday night—the night of the murder. hastings, do you not see?\\nthat alters everything—everything!”\\n\\ni had never seen him so upset. loosening his hold of me, he\\nmechanically straightened a pair of candlesticks, still murmuring to\\nhimself: “yes, that alters everything—everything.”\\n\\nsuddenly he seemed to come to a decision.\\n\\n“_allons!_” he said. “we must act at once. where is mr. cavendish?”\\n\\njohn was in the smoking-room. poirot went straight to him.\\n\\n“mr. cavendish, i have some important business in tadminster. a new\\nclue. may i take your motor?”\\n\\n“why, of course. do you mean at once?”\\n\\n“if you please.”\\n\\njohn rang the bell, and ordered round the car. in another ten minutes,\\nwe were racing down the park and along the high road to tadminster.\\n\\n“now, poirot,” i remarked resignedly, “perhaps you will tell me what\\nall this is about?”\\n\\n“well, _mon ami_, a good deal you can guess for yourself. of course you\\nrealize that, now mr. inglethorp is out of it, the whole position is\\ngreatly changed. we are face to face with an entirely new problem. we\\nknow now that there is one person who did not buy the poison. we have\\ncleared away the manufactured clues. now for the real ones. i have\\nascertained that anyone in the household, with the exception of mrs.\\ncavendish, who was playing tennis with you, could have personated mr.\\ninglethorp on monday evening. in the same way, we have his statement\\nthat he put the coffee down in the hall. no one took much notice of\\nthat at the inquest—but now it has a very different significance. we\\nmust find out who did take that coffee to mrs. inglethorp eventually,\\nor who passed through the hall whilst it was standing there. from your\\naccount, there are only two people whom we can positively say did not\\ngo near the coffee—mrs. cavendish, and mademoiselle cynthia.”\\n\\n“yes, that is so.” i felt an inexpressible lightening of the heart.\\nmary cavendish could certainly not rest under suspicion.\\n\\n“in clearing alfred inglethorp,” continued poirot, “i have been obliged\\nto show my hand sooner than i intended. as long as i might be thought\\nto be pursuing him, the criminal would be off his guard. now, he will\\nbe doubly careful. yes—doubly careful.” he turned to me abruptly. “tell\\nme, hastings, you yourself—have you no suspicions of anybody?”\\n\\ni hesitated. to tell the truth, an idea, wild and extravagant in\\nitself, had once or twice that morning flashed through my brain. i had\\nrejected it as absurd, nevertheless it persisted.\\n\\n“you couldn’t call it a suspicion,” i murmured. “it’s so utterly\\nfoolish.”\\n\\n“come now,” urged poirot encouragingly. “do not fear. speak your mind.\\nyou should always pay attention to your instincts.”\\n\\n“well then,” i blurted out, “it’s absurd—but i suspect miss howard of\\nnot telling all she knows!”\\n\\n“miss howard?”\\n\\n“yes—you’ll laugh at me——”\\n\\n“not at all. why should i?”\\n\\n“i can’t help feeling,” i continued blunderingly; “that we’ve rather\\nleft her out of the possible suspects, simply on the strength of her\\nhaving been away from the place. but, after all, she was only fifteen\\nmiles away. a car would do it in half an hour. can we say positively\\nthat she was away from styles on the night of the murder?”\\n\\n“yes, my friend,” said poirot unexpectedly, “we can. one of my first\\nactions was to ring up the hospital where she was working.”\\n\\n“well?”\\n\\n“well, i learnt that miss howard had been on afternoon duty on tuesday,\\nand that—a convoy coming in unexpectedly—she had kindly offered to\\nremain on night duty, which offer was gratefully accepted. that\\ndisposes of that.”\\n\\n“oh!” i said, rather nonplussed. “really,” i continued, “it’s her\\nextraordinary vehemence against inglethorp that started me off\\nsuspecting her. i can’t help feeling she’d do anything against him. and\\ni had an idea she might know something about the destroying of the\\nwill. she might have burnt the new one, mistaking it for the earlier\\none in his favour. she is so terribly bitter against him.”\\n\\n“you consider her vehemence unnatural?”\\n\\n“y—es. she is so very violent. i wondered really whether she is quite\\nsane on that point.”\\n\\npoirot shook his head energetically.\\n\\n“no, no, you are on a wrong tack there. there is nothing weak-minded or\\ndegenerate about miss howard. she is an excellent specimen of\\nwell-balanced english beef and brawn. she is sanity itself.”\\n\\n“yet her hatred of inglethorp seems almost a mania. my idea was—a very\\nridiculous one, no doubt—that she had intended to poison him—and that,\\nin some way, mrs. inglethorp got hold of it by mistake. but i don’t at\\nall see how it could have been done. the whole thing is absurd and\\nridiculous to the last degree.”\\n\\n“still you are right in one thing. it is always wise to suspect\\neverybody until you can prove logically, and to your own satisfaction,\\nthat they are innocent. now, what reasons are there against miss\\nhoward’s having deliberately poisoned mrs. inglethorp?”\\n\\n“why, she was devoted to her!” i exclaimed.\\n\\n“tcha! tcha!” cried poirot irritably. “you argue like a child. if miss\\nhoward were capable of poisoning the old lady, she would be quite\\nequally capable of simulating devotion. no, we must look elsewhere. you\\nare perfectly correct in your assumption that her vehemence against\\nalfred inglethorp is too violent to be natural; but you are quite wrong\\nin the deduction you draw from it. i have drawn my own deductions,\\nwhich i believe to be correct, but i will not speak of them at\\npresent.” he paused a minute, then went on. “now, to my way of\\nthinking, there is one insuperable objection to miss howard’s being the\\nmurderess.”\\n\\n“and that is?”\\n\\n“that in no possible way could mrs. inglethorp’s death benefit miss\\nhoward. now there is no murder without a motive.”\\n\\ni reflected.\\n\\n“could not mrs. inglethorp have made a will in her favour?”\\n\\npoirot shook his head.\\n\\n“but you yourself suggested that possibility to mr. wells?”\\n\\npoirot smiled.\\n\\n“that was for a reason. i did not want to mention the name of the\\nperson who was actually in my mind. miss howard occupied very much the\\nsame position, so i used her name instead.”\\n\\n“still, mrs. inglethorp might have done so. why, that will, made on the\\nafternoon of her death may——”\\n\\nbut poirot’s shake of the head was so energetic that i stopped.\\n\\n“no, my friend. i have certain little ideas of my own about that will.\\nbut i can tell you this much—it was not in miss howard’s favour.”\\n\\ni accepted his assurance, though i did not really see how he could be\\nso positive about the matter.\\n\\n“well,” i said, with a sigh, “we will acquit miss howard, then. it is\\npartly your fault that i ever came to suspect her. it was what you said\\nabout her evidence at the inquest that set me off.”\\n\\npoirot looked puzzled.\\n\\n“what did i say about her evidence at the inquest?”\\n\\n“don’t you remember? when i cited her and john cavendish as being above\\nsuspicion?”\\n\\n“oh—ah—yes.” he seemed a little confused, but recovered himself. “by\\nthe way, hastings, there is something i want you to do for me.”\\n\\n“certainly. what is it?”\\n\\n“next time you happen to be alone with lawrence cavendish, i want you\\nto say this to him. ‘i have a message for you, from poirot. he says:\\n“find the extra coffee-cup, and you can rest in peace!”’ nothing more.\\nnothing less.”\\n\\n“‘find the extra coffee-cup, and you can rest in peace.’ is that\\nright?” i asked, much mystified.\\n\\n“excellent.”\\n\\n“but what does it mean?”\\n\\n“ah, that i will leave you to find out. you have access to the facts.\\njust say that to him, and see what he says.”\\n\\n“very well—but it’s all extremely mysterious.”\\n\\nwe were running into tadminster now, and poirot directed the car to the\\n“analytical chemist.”\\n\\npoirot hopped down briskly, and went inside. in a few minutes he was\\nback again.\\n\\n“there,” he said. “that is all my business.”\\n\\n“what were you doing there?” i asked, in lively curiosity.\\n\\n“i left something to be analysed.”\\n\\n“yes, but what?”\\n\\n“the sample of cocoa i took from the saucepan in the bedroom.”\\n\\n“but that has already been tested!” i cried, stupefied. “dr. bauerstein\\nhad it tested, and you yourself laughed at the possibility of there\\nbeing strychnine in it.”\\n\\n“i know dr. bauerstein had it tested,” replied poirot quietly.\\n\\n“well, then?”\\n\\n“well, i have a fancy for having it analysed again, that is all.”\\n\\nand not another word on the subject could i drag out of him.\\n\\nthis proceeding of poirot’s, in respect of the cocoa, puzzled me\\nintensely. i could see neither rhyme nor reason in it. however, my\\nconfidence in him, which at one time had rather waned, was fully\\nrestored since his belief in alfred inglethorp’s innocence had been so\\ntriumphantly vindicated.\\n\\nthe funeral of mrs. inglethorp took place the following day, and on\\nmonday, as i came down to a late breakfast, john drew me aside, and\\ninformed me that mr. inglethorp was leaving that morning, to take up\\nhis quarters at the stylites arms until he should have completed his\\nplans.\\n\\n“and really it’s a great relief to think he’s going, hastings,”\\ncontinued my honest friend. “it was bad enough before, when we thought\\nhe’d done it, but i’m hanged if it isn’t worse now, when we all feel\\nguilty for having been so down on the fellow. the fact is, we’ve\\ntreated him abominably. of course, things did look black against him. i\\ndon’t see how anyone could blame us for jumping to the conclusions we\\ndid. still, there it is, we were in the wrong, and now there’s a\\nbeastly feeling that one ought to make amends; which is difficult, when\\none doesn’t like the fellow a bit better than one did before. the whole\\nthing’s damned awkward! and i’m thankful he’s had the tact to take\\nhimself off. it’s a good thing styles wasn’t the mater’s to leave to\\nhim. couldn’t bear to think of the fellow lording it here. he’s welcome\\nto her money.”\\n\\n“you’ll be able to keep up the place all right?” i asked.\\n\\n“oh, yes. there are the death duties, of course, but half my father’s\\nmoney goes with the place, and lawrence will stay with us for the\\npresent, so there is his share as well. we shall be pinched at first,\\nof course, because, as i once told you, i am in a bit of a hole\\nfinancially myself. still, the johnnies will wait now.”\\n\\nin the general relief at inglethorp’s approaching departure, we had the\\nmost genial breakfast we had experienced since the tragedy. cynthia,\\nwhose young spirits were naturally buoyant, was looking quite her\\npretty self again, and we all, with the exception of lawrence, who\\nseemed unalterably gloomy and nervous, were quietly cheerful, at the\\nopening of a new and hopeful future.\\n\\nthe papers, of course, had been full of the tragedy. glaring headlines,\\nsandwiched biographies of every member of the household, subtle\\ninnuendoes, the usual familiar tag about the police having a clue.\\nnothing was spared us. it was a slack time. the war was momentarily\\ninactive, and the newspapers seized with avidity on this crime in\\nfashionable life: “the mysterious affair at styles” was the topic of\\nthe moment.\\n\\nnaturally it was very annoying for the cavendishes. the house was\\nconstantly besieged by reporters, who were consistently denied\\nadmission, but who continued to haunt the village and the grounds,\\nwhere they lay in wait with cameras, for any unwary members of the\\nhousehold. we all lived in a blast of publicity. the scotland yard men\\ncame and went, examining, questioning, lynx-eyed and reserved of\\ntongue. towards what end they were working, we did not know. had they\\nany clue, or would the whole thing remain in the category of\\nundiscovered crimes?\\n\\nafter breakfast, dorcas came up to me rather mysteriously, and asked if\\nshe might have a few words with me.\\n\\n“certainly. what is it, dorcas?”\\n\\n“well, it’s just this, sir. you’ll be seeing the belgian gentleman\\nto-day perhaps?” i nodded. “well, sir, you know how he asked me so\\nparticular if the mistress, or anyone else, had a green dress?”\\n\\n“yes, yes. you have found one?” my interest was aroused.\\n\\n“no, not that, sir. but since then i’ve remembered what the young\\ngentlemen”—john and lawrence were still the “young gentlemen” to\\ndorcas—“call the ‘dressing-up box.’ it’s up in the front attic, sir. a\\ngreat chest, full of old clothes and fancy dresses, and what not. and\\nit came to me sudden like that there might be a green dress amongst\\nthem. so, if you’d tell the belgian gentleman——”\\n\\n“i will tell him, dorcas,” i promised.\\n\\n“thank you very much, sir. a very nice gentleman he is, sir. and quite\\na different class from them two detectives from london, what goes\\nprying about, and asking questions. i don’t hold with foreigners as a\\nrule, but from what the newspapers say i make out as how these brave\\nbelges isn’t the ordinary run of foreigners, and certainly he’s a most\\npolite spoken gentleman.”\\n\\ndear old dorcas! as she stood there, with her honest face upturned to\\nmine, i thought what a fine specimen she was of the old-fashioned\\nservant that is so fast dying out.\\n\\ni thought i might as well go down to the village at once, and look up\\npoirot; but i met him half-way, coming up to the house, and at once\\ngave him dorcas’s message.\\n\\n“ah, the brave dorcas! we will look at the chest, although—but no\\nmatter—we will examine it all the same.”\\n\\nwe entered the house by one of the windows. there was no one in the\\nhall, and we went straight up to the attic.\\n\\nsure enough, there was the chest, a fine old piece, all studded with\\nbrass nails, and full to overflowing with every imaginable type of\\ngarment.\\n\\npoirot bundled everything out on the floor with scant ceremony. there\\nwere one or two green fabrics of varying shades; but poirot shook his\\nhead over them all. he seemed somewhat apathetic in the search, as\\nthough he expected no great results from it. suddenly he gave an\\nexclamation.\\n\\n“what is it?”\\n\\n“look!”\\n\\nthe chest was nearly empty, and there, reposing right at the bottom,\\nwas a magnificent black beard.\\n\\n“_ohó!_” said poirot. “_ohó!_” he turned it over in his hands,\\nexamining it closely. “new,” he remarked. “yes, quite new.”\\n\\nafter a moment’s hesitation, he replaced it in the chest, heaped all\\nthe other things on top of it as before, and made his way briskly\\ndownstairs. he went straight to the pantry, where we found dorcas\\nbusily polishing her silver.\\n\\npoirot wished her good morning with gallic politeness, and went on:\\n\\n“we have been looking through that chest, dorcas. i am much obliged to\\nyou for mentioning it. there is, indeed, a fine collection there. are\\nthey often used, may i ask?”\\n\\n“well, sir, not very often nowadays, though from time to time we do\\nhave what the young gentlemen call ‘a dress-up night.’ and very funny\\nit is sometimes, sir. mr. lawrence, he’s wonderful. most comic! i shall\\nnever forget the night he came down as the char of persia, i think he\\ncalled it—a sort of eastern king it was. he had the big paper knife in\\nhis hand, and ‘mind, dorcas,’ he says, ‘you’ll have to be very\\nrespectful. this is my specially sharpened scimitar, and it’s off with\\nyour head if i’m at all displeased with you!’ miss cynthia, she was\\nwhat they call an apache, or some such name—a frenchified sort of\\ncut-throat, i take it to be. a real sight she looked. you’d never have\\nbelieved a pretty young lady like that could have made herself into\\nsuch a ruffian. nobody would have known her.”\\n\\n“these evenings must have been great fun,” said poirot genially. “i\\nsuppose mr. lawrence wore that fine black beard in the chest upstairs,\\nwhen he was shah of persia?”\\n\\n“he did have a beard, sir,” replied dorcas, smiling. “and well i know\\nit, for he borrowed two skeins of my black wool to make it with! and\\ni’m sure it looked wonderfully natural at a distance. i didn’t know as\\nthere was a beard up there at all. it must have been got quite lately,\\ni think. there was a red wig, i know, but nothing else in the way of\\nhair. burnt corks they use mostly—though ‘tis messy getting it off\\nagain. miss cynthia was a nigger once, and, oh, the trouble she had.”\\n\\n“so dorcas knows nothing about that black beard,” said poirot\\nthoughtfully, as we walked out into the hall again.\\n\\n“do you think it is _the_ one?” i whispered eagerly.\\n\\npoirot nodded.\\n\\n“i do. you notice it had been trimmed?”\\n\\n“no.”\\n\\n“yes. it was cut exactly the shape of mr. inglethorp’s, and i found one\\nor two snipped hairs. hastings, this affair is very deep.”\\n\\n“who put it in the chest, i wonder?”\\n\\n“someone with a good deal of intelligence,” remarked poirot dryly. “you\\nrealize that he chose the one place in the house to hide it where its\\npresence would not be remarked? yes, he is intelligent. but we must be\\nmore intelligent. we must be so intelligent that he does not suspect us\\nof being intelligent at all.”\\n\\ni acquiesced.\\n\\n“there, _mon ami_, you will be of great assistance to me.”\\n\\ni was pleased with the compliment. there had been times when i hardly\\nthought that poirot appreciated me at my true worth.\\n\\n“yes,” he continued, staring at me thoughtfully, “you will be\\ninvaluable.”\\n\\nthis was naturally gratifying, but poirot’s next words were not so\\nwelcome.\\n\\n“i must have an ally in the house,” he observed reflectively.\\n\\n“you have me,” i protested.\\n\\n“true, but you are not sufficient.”\\n\\ni was hurt, and showed it. poirot hurried to explain himself.\\n\\n“you do not quite take my meaning. you are known to be working with me.\\ni want somebody who is not associated with us in any way.”\\n\\n“oh, i see. how about john?”\\n\\n“no, i think not.”\\n\\n“the dear fellow isn’t perhaps very bright,” i said thoughtfully.\\n\\n“here comes miss howard,” said poirot suddenly. “she is the very\\nperson. but i am in her black books, since i cleared mr. inglethorp.\\nstill, we can but try.”\\n\\nwith a nod that was barely civil, miss howard assented to poirot’s\\nrequest for a few minutes’ conversation.\\n\\nwe went into the little morning-room, and poirot closed the door.\\n\\n“well, monsieur poirot,” said miss howard impatiently, “what is it? out\\nwith it. i’m busy.”\\n\\n“do you remember, mademoiselle, that i once asked you to help me?”\\n\\n“yes, i do.” the lady nodded. “and i told you i’d help you with\\npleasure—to hang alfred inglethorp.”\\n\\n“ah!” poirot studied her seriously. “miss howard, i will ask you one\\nquestion. i beg of you to reply to it truthfully.”\\n\\n“never tell lies,” replied miss howard.\\n\\n“it is this. do you still believe that mrs. inglethorp was poisoned by\\nher husband?”\\n\\n“what do you mean?” she asked sharply. “you needn’t think your pretty\\nexplanations influence me in the slightest. i’ll admit that it wasn’t\\nhe who bought strychnine at the chemist’s shop. what of that? i dare\\nsay he soaked fly paper, as i told you at the beginning.”\\n\\n“that is arsenic—not strychnine,” said poirot mildly.\\n\\n“what does that matter? arsenic would put poor emily out of the way\\njust as well as strychnine. if i’m convinced he did it, it doesn’t\\nmatter a jot to me _how_ he did it.”\\n\\n“exactly. _if_ you are convinced he did it,” said poirot quietly. “i\\nwill put my question in another form. did you ever in your heart of\\nhearts believe that mrs. inglethorp was poisoned by her husband?”\\n\\n“good heavens!” cried miss howard. “haven’t i always told you the man\\nis a villain? haven’t i always told you he would murder her in her bed?\\nhaven’t i always hated him like poison?”\\n\\n“exactly,” said poirot. “that bears out my little idea entirely.”\\n\\n“what little idea?”\\n\\n“miss howard, do you remember a conversation that took place on the day\\nof my friend’s arrival here? he repeated it to me, and there is a\\nsentence of yours that has impressed me very much. do you remember\\naffirming that if a crime had been committed, and anyone you loved had\\nbeen murdered, you felt certain that you would know by instinct who the\\ncriminal was, even if you were quite unable to prove it?”\\n\\n“yes, i remember saying that. i believe it too. i suppose you think it\\nnonsense?”\\n\\n“not at all.”\\n\\n“and yet you will pay no attention to my instinct against alfred\\ninglethorp.”\\n\\n“no,” said poirot curtly. “because your instinct is not against mr.\\ninglethorp.”\\n\\n“what?”\\n\\n“no. you wish to believe he committed the crime. you believe him\\ncapable of committing it. but your instinct tells you he did not commit\\nit. it tells you more—shall i go on?”\\n\\nshe was staring at him, fascinated, and made a slight affirmative\\nmovement of the hand.\\n\\n“shall i tell you why you have been so vehement against mr. inglethorp?\\nit is because you have been trying to believe what you wish to believe.\\nit is because you are trying to drown and stifle your instinct, which\\ntells you another name——”\\n\\n“no, no, no!” cried miss howard wildly, flinging up her hands. “don’t\\nsay it! oh, don’t say it! it isn’t true! it can’t be true. i don’t know\\nwhat put such a wild—such a dreadful—idea into my head!”\\n\\n“i am right, am i not?” asked poirot.\\n\\n“yes, yes; you must be a wizard to have guessed. but it can’t be\\nso—it’s too monstrous, too impossible. it _must_ be alfred inglethorp.”\\n\\npoirot shook his head gravely.\\n\\n“don’t ask me about it,” continued miss howard, “because i shan’t tell\\nyou. i won’t admit it, even to myself. i must be mad to think of such a\\nthing.”\\n\\npoirot nodded, as if satisfied.\\n\\n“i will ask you nothing. it is enough for me that it is as i thought.\\nand i—i, too, have an instinct. we are working together towards a\\ncommon end.”\\n\\n“don’t ask me to help you, because i won’t. i wouldn’t lift a finger\\nto—to——” she faltered.\\n\\n“you will help me in spite of yourself. i ask you nothing—but you will\\nbe my ally. you will not be able to help yourself. you will do the only\\nthing that i want of you.”\\n\\n“and that is?”\\n\\n“you will watch!”\\n\\nevelyn howard bowed her head.\\n\\n“yes, i can’t help doing that. i am always watching—always hoping i\\nshall be proved wrong.”\\n\\n“if we are wrong, well and good,” said poirot. “no one will be more\\npleased than i shall. but, if we are right? if we are right, miss\\nhoward, on whose side are you then?”\\n\\n“i don’t know, i don’t know——”\\n\\n“come now.”\\n\\n“it could be hushed up.”\\n\\n“there must be no hushing up.”\\n\\n“but emily herself——” she broke off.\\n\\n“miss howard,” said poirot gravely, “this is unworthy of you.”\\n\\nsuddenly she took her face from her hands.\\n\\n“yes,” she said quietly, “that was not evelyn howard who spoke!” she\\nflung her head up proudly. “_this_ is evelyn howard! and she is on the\\nside of justice! let the cost be what it may.” and with these words,\\nshe walked firmly out of the room.\\n\\n“there,” said poirot, looking after her, “goes a very valuable ally.\\nthat woman, hastings, has got brains as well as a heart.”\\n\\ni did not reply.\\n\\n“instinct is a marvellous thing,” mused poirot. “it can neither be\\nexplained nor ignored.”\\n\\n“you and miss howard seem to know what you are talking about,” i\\nobserved coldly. “perhaps you don’t realize that _i_ am still in the\\ndark.”\\n\\n“really? is that so, _mon ami?_”\\n\\n“yes. enlighten me, will you?”\\n\\npoirot studied me attentively for a moment or two. then, to my intense\\nsurprise, he shook his head decidedly.\\n\\n“no, my friend.”\\n\\n“oh, look here, why not?”\\n\\n“two is enough for a secret.”\\n\\n“well, i think it is very unfair to keep back facts from me.”\\n\\n“i am not keeping back facts. every fact that i know is in your\\npossession. you can draw your own deductions from them. this time it is\\na question of ideas.”\\n\\n“still, it would be interesting to know.”\\n\\npoirot looked at me very earnestly, and again shook his head.\\n\\n“you see,” he said sadly, “_you_ have no instincts.”\\n\\n“it was intelligence you were requiring just now,” i pointed out.\\n\\n“the two often go together,” said poirot enigmatically.\\n\\nthe remark seemed so utterly irrelevant that i did not even take the\\ntrouble to answer it. but i decided that if i made any interesting and\\nimportant discoveries—as no doubt i should—i would keep them to myself,\\nand surprise poirot with the ultimate result.\\n\\nthere are times when it is one’s duty to assert oneself.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter ix.\\ndr. bauerstein\\n\\n\\ni had had no opportunity as yet of passing on poirot’s message to\\nlawrence. but now, as i strolled out on the lawn, still nursing a\\ngrudge against my friend’s high-handedness, i saw lawrence on the\\ncroquet lawn, aimlessly knocking a couple of very ancient balls about,\\nwith a still more ancient mallet.\\n\\nit struck me that it would be a good opportunity to deliver my message.\\notherwise, poirot himself might relieve me of it. it was true that i\\ndid not quite gather its purport, but i flattered myself that by\\nlawrence’s reply, and perhaps a little skillful cross-examination on my\\npart, i should soon perceive its significance. accordingly i accosted\\nhim.\\n\\n“i’ve been looking for you,” i remarked untruthfully.\\n\\n“have you?”\\n\\n“yes. the truth is, i’ve got a message for you—from poirot.”\\n\\n“yes?”\\n\\n“he told me to wait until i was alone with you,” i said, dropping my\\nvoice significantly, and watching him intently out of the corner of my\\neye. i have always been rather good at what is called, i believe,\\ncreating an atmosphere.\\n\\n“well?”\\n\\nthere was no change of expression in the dark melancholic face. had he\\nany idea of what i was about to say?\\n\\n“this is the message.” i dropped my voice still lower. “‘find the extra\\ncoffee-cup, and you can rest in peace.’”\\n\\n“what on earth does he mean?” lawrence stared at me in quite unaffected\\nastonishment.\\n\\n“don’t you know?”\\n\\n“not in the least. do you?”\\n\\ni was compelled to shake my head.\\n\\n“what extra coffee-cup?”\\n\\n“i don’t know.”\\n\\n“he’d better ask dorcas, or one of the maids, if he wants to know about\\ncoffee-cups. it’s their business, not mine. i don’t know anything about\\nthe coffee-cups, except that we’ve got some that are never used, which\\nare a perfect dream! old worcester. you’re not a connoisseur, are you,\\nhastings?”\\n\\ni shook my head.\\n\\n“you miss a lot. a really perfect bit of old china—it’s pure delight to\\nhandle it, or even to look at it.”\\n\\n“well, what am i to tell poirot?”\\n\\n“tell him i don’t know what he’s talking about. it’s double dutch to\\nme.”\\n\\n“all right.”\\n\\ni was moving off towards the house again when he suddenly called me\\nback.\\n\\n“i say, what was the end of that message? say it over again, will you?”\\n\\n“‘find the extra coffee-cup, and you can rest in peace.’ are you sure\\nyou don’t know what it means?” i asked him earnestly.\\n\\nhe shook his head.\\n\\n“no,” he said musingly, “i don’t. i—i wish i did.”\\n\\nthe boom of the gong sounded from the house, and we went in together.\\npoirot had been asked by john to remain to lunch, and was already\\nseated at the table.\\n\\nby tacit consent, all mention of the tragedy was barred. we conversed\\non the war, and other outside topics. but after the cheese and biscuits\\nhad been handed round, and dorcas had left the room, poirot suddenly\\nleant forward to mrs. cavendish.\\n\\n“pardon me, madame, for recalling unpleasant memories, but i have a\\nlittle idea”—poirot’s “little ideas” were becoming a perfect\\nbyword—“and would like to ask one or two questions.”\\n\\n“of me? certainly.”\\n\\n“you are too amiable, madame. what i want to ask is this: the door\\nleading into mrs. inglethorp’s room from that of mademoiselle cynthia,\\nit was bolted, you say?”\\n\\n“certainly it was bolted,” replied mary cavendish, rather surprised. “i\\nsaid so at the inquest.”\\n\\n“bolted?”\\n\\n“yes.” she looked perplexed.\\n\\n“i mean,” explained poirot, “you are sure it was bolted, and not merely\\nlocked?”\\n\\n“oh, i see what you mean. no, i don’t know. i said bolted, meaning that\\nit was fastened, and i could not open it, but i believe all the doors\\nwere found bolted on the inside.”\\n\\n“still, as far as you are concerned, the door might equally well have\\nbeen locked?”\\n\\n“oh, yes.”\\n\\n“you yourself did not happen to notice, madame, when you entered mrs.\\ninglethorp’s room, whether that door was bolted or not?”\\n\\n“i—i believe it was.”\\n\\n“but you did not see it?”\\n\\n“no. i—never looked.”\\n\\n“but _i_ did,” interrupted lawrence suddenly. “i happened to notice\\nthat it _was_ bolted.”\\n\\n“ah, that settles it.” and poirot looked crestfallen.\\n\\ni could not help rejoicing that, for once, one of his “little ideas”\\nhad come to naught.\\n\\nafter lunch poirot begged me to accompany him home. i consented rather\\nstiffly.\\n\\n“you are annoyed, is it not so?” he asked anxiously, as we walked\\nthrough the park.\\n\\n“not at all,” i said coldly.\\n\\n“that is well. that lifts a great load from my mind.”\\n\\nthis was not quite what i had intended. i had hoped that he would have\\nobserved the stiffness of my manner. still, the fervour of his words\\nwent towards the appeasing of my just displeasure. i thawed.\\n\\n“i gave lawrence your message,” i said.\\n\\n“and what did he say? he was entirely puzzled?”\\n\\n“yes. i am quite sure he had no idea of what you meant.”\\n\\ni had expected poirot to be disappointed; but, to my surprise, he\\nreplied that that was as he had thought, and that he was very glad. my\\npride forbade me to ask any questions.\\n\\npoirot switched off on another tack.\\n\\n“mademoiselle cynthia was not at lunch to-day? how was that?”\\n\\n“she is at the hospital again. she resumed work to-day.”\\n\\n“ah, she is an industrious little demoiselle. and pretty too. she is\\nlike pictures i have seen in italy. i would rather like to see that\\ndispensary of hers. do you think she would show it to me?”\\n\\n“i am sure she would be delighted. it’s an interesting little place.”\\n\\n“does she go there every day?”\\n\\n“she has all wednesdays off, and comes back to lunch on saturdays.\\nthose are her only times off.”\\n\\n“i will remember. women are doing great work nowadays, and mademoiselle\\ncynthia is clever—oh, yes, she has brains, that little one.”\\n\\n“yes. i believe she has passed quite a stiff exam.”\\n\\n“without doubt. after all, it is very responsible work. i suppose they\\nhave very strong poisons there?”\\n\\n“yes, she showed them to us. they are kept locked up in a little\\ncupboard. i believe they have to be very careful. they always take out\\nthe key before leaving the room.”\\n\\n“indeed. it is near the window, this cupboard?”\\n\\n“no, right the other side of the room. why?”\\n\\npoirot shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n“i wondered. that is all. will you come in?”\\n\\nwe had reached the cottage.\\n\\n“no. i think i’ll be getting back. i shall go round the long way\\nthrough the woods.”\\n\\nthe woods round styles were very beautiful. after the walk across the\\nopen park, it was pleasant to saunter lazily through the cool glades.\\nthere was hardly a breath of wind, the very chirp of the birds was\\nfaint and subdued. i strolled on a little way, and finally flung myself\\ndown at the foot of a grand old beech-tree. my thoughts of mankind were\\nkindly and charitable. i even forgave poirot for his absurd secrecy. in\\nfact, i was at peace with the world. then i yawned.\\n\\ni thought about the crime, and it struck me as being very unreal and\\nfar off.\\n\\ni yawned again.\\n\\nprobably, i thought, it really never happened. of course, it was all a\\nbad dream. the truth of the matter was that it was lawrence who had\\nmurdered alfred inglethorp with a croquet mallet. but it was absurd of\\njohn to make such a fuss about it, and to go shouting out: “i tell you\\ni won’t have it!”\\n\\ni woke up with a start.\\n\\nat once i realized that i was in a very awkward predicament. for, about\\ntwelve feet away from me, john and mary cavendish were standing facing\\neach other, and they were evidently quarrelling. and, quite as\\nevidently, they were unaware of my vicinity, for before i could move or\\nspeak john repeated the words which had aroused me from my dream.\\n\\n“i tell you, mary, i won’t have it.”\\n\\nmary’s voice came, cool and liquid:\\n\\n“have _you_ any right to criticize my actions?”\\n\\n“it will be the talk of the village! my mother was only buried on\\nsaturday, and here you are gadding about with the fellow.”\\n\\n“oh,” she shrugged her shoulders, “if it is only village gossip that\\nyou mind!”\\n\\n“but it isn’t. i’ve had enough of the fellow hanging about. he’s a\\npolish jew, anyway.”\\n\\n“a tinge of jewish blood is not a bad thing. it leavens the”—she looked\\nat him—“stolid stupidity of the ordinary englishman.”\\n\\nfire in her eyes, ice in her voice. i did not wonder that the blood\\nrose to john’s face in a crimson tide.\\n\\n“mary!”\\n\\n“well?” her tone did not change.\\n\\nthe pleading died out of his voice.\\n\\n“am i to understand that you will continue to see bauerstein against my\\nexpress wishes?”\\n\\n“if i choose.”\\n\\n“you defy me?”\\n\\n“no, but i deny your right to criticize my actions. have _you_ no\\nfriends of whom i should disapprove?”\\n\\njohn fell back a pace. the colour ebbed slowly from his face.\\n\\n“what do you mean?” he said, in an unsteady voice.\\n\\n“you see!” said mary quietly. “you _do_ see, don’t you, that _you_ have\\nno right to dictate to _me_ as to the choice of my friends?”\\n\\njohn glanced at her pleadingly, a stricken look on his face.\\n\\n“no right? have i _no_ right, mary?” he said unsteadily. he stretched\\nout his hands. “mary——”\\n\\nfor a moment, i thought she wavered. a softer expression came over her\\nface, then suddenly she turned almost fiercely away.\\n\\n“none!”\\n\\nshe was walking away when john sprang after her, and caught her by the\\narm.\\n\\n“mary”—his voice was very quiet now—“are you in love with this fellow\\nbauerstein?”\\n\\nshe hesitated, and suddenly there swept across her face a strange\\nexpression, old as the hills, yet with something eternally young about\\nit. so might some egyptian sphinx have smiled.\\n\\nshe freed herself quietly from his arm, and spoke over her shoulder.\\n\\n“perhaps,” she said; and then swiftly passed out of the little glade,\\nleaving john standing there as though he had been turned to stone.\\n\\nrather ostentatiously, i stepped forward, crackling some dead branches\\nwith my feet as i did so. john turned. luckily, he took it for granted\\nthat i had only just come upon the scene.\\n\\n“hullo, hastings. have you seen the little fellow safely back to his\\ncottage? quaint little chap! is he any good, though, really?”\\n\\n“he was considered one of the finest detectives of his day.”\\n\\n“oh, well, i suppose there must be something in it, then. what a rotten\\nworld it is, though!”\\n\\n“you find it so?” i asked.\\n\\n“good lord, yes! there’s this terrible business to start with. scotland\\nyard men in and out of the house like a jack-in-the-box! never know\\nwhere they won’t turn up next. screaming headlines in every paper in\\nthe country—damn all journalists, i say! do you know there was a whole\\ncrowd staring in at the lodge gates this morning. sort of madame\\ntussaud’s chamber of horrors business that can be seen for nothing.\\npretty thick, isn’t it?”\\n\\n“cheer up, john!” i said soothingly. “it can’t last for ever.”\\n\\n“can’t it, though? it can last long enough for us never to be able to\\nhold up our heads again.”\\n\\n“no, no, you’re getting morbid on the subject.”\\n\\n“enough to make a man morbid, to be stalked by beastly journalists and\\nstared at by gaping moon-faced idiots, wherever he goes! but there’s\\nworse than that.”\\n\\n“what?”\\n\\njohn lowered his voice:\\n\\n“have you ever thought, hastings—it’s a nightmare to me—who did it? i\\ncan’t help feeling sometimes it must have been an accident.\\nbecause—because—who could have done it? now inglethorp’s out of the\\nway, there’s no one else; no one, i mean, except—one of us.”\\n\\nyes, indeed, that was nightmare enough for any man! one of us? yes,\\nsurely it must be so, unless——-\\n\\na new idea suggested itself to my mind. rapidly, i considered it. the\\nlight increased. poirot’s mysterious doings, his hints—they all fitted\\nin. fool that i was not to have thought of this possibility before, and\\nwhat a relief for us all.\\n\\n“no, john,” i said, “it isn’t one of us. how could it be?”\\n\\n“i know, but, still, who else is there?”\\n\\n“can’t you guess?”\\n\\n“no.”\\n\\ni looked cautiously round, and lowered my voice.\\n\\n“dr. bauerstein!” i whispered.\\n\\n“impossible!”\\n\\n“not at all.”\\n\\n“but what earthly interest could he have in my mother’s death?”\\n\\n“that i don’t see,” i confessed, “but i’ll tell you this: poirot thinks\\nso.”\\n\\n“poirot? does he? how do you know?”\\n\\ni told him of poirot’s intense excitement on hearing that dr.\\nbauerstein had been at styles on the fatal night, and added:\\n\\n“he said twice: ‘that alters everything.’ and i’ve been thinking. you\\nknow inglethorp said he had put down the coffee in the hall? well, it\\nwas just then that bauerstein arrived. isn’t it possible that, as\\ninglethorp brought him through the hall, the doctor dropped something\\ninto the coffee in passing?”\\n\\n“h’m,” said john. “it would have been very risky.”\\n\\n“yes, but it was possible.”\\n\\n“and then, how could he know it was her coffee? no, old fellow, i don’t\\nthink that will wash.”\\n\\nbut i had remembered something else.\\n\\n“you’re quite right. that wasn’t how it was done. listen.” and i then\\ntold him of the cocoa sample which poirot had taken to be analysed.\\n\\njohn interrupted just as i had done.\\n\\n“but, look here, bauerstein had had it analysed already?”\\n\\n“yes, yes, that’s the point. i didn’t see it either until now. don’t\\nyou understand? bauerstein had it analysed—that’s just it! if\\nbauerstein’s the murderer, nothing could be simpler than for him to\\nsubstitute some ordinary cocoa for his sample, and send that to be\\ntested. and of course they would find no strychnine! but no one would\\ndream of suspecting bauerstein, or think of taking another\\nsample—except poirot,” i added, with belated recognition.\\n\\n“yes, but what about the bitter taste that cocoa won’t disguise?”\\n\\n“well, we’ve only his word for that. and there are other possibilities.\\nhe’s admittedly one of the world’s greatest toxicologists——”\\n\\n“one of the world’s greatest what? say it again.”\\n\\n“he knows more about poisons than almost anybody,” i explained. “well,\\nmy idea is, that perhaps he’s found some way of making strychnine\\ntasteless. or it may not have been strychnine at all, but some obscure\\ndrug no one has ever heard of, which produces much the same symptoms.”\\n\\n“h’m, yes, that might be,” said john. “but look here, how could he have\\ngot at the cocoa? that wasn’t downstairs?”\\n\\n“no, it wasn’t,” i admitted reluctantly.\\n\\nand then, suddenly, a dreadful possibility flashed through my mind. i\\nhoped and prayed it would not occur to john also. i glanced sideways at\\nhim. he was frowning perplexedly, and i drew a deep breath of relief,\\nfor the terrible thought that had flashed across my mind was this: that\\ndr. bauerstein might have had an accomplice.\\n\\nyet surely it could not be! surely no woman as beautiful as mary\\ncavendish could be a murderess. yet beautiful women had been known to\\npoison.\\n\\nand suddenly i remembered that first conversation at tea on the day of\\nmy arrival, and the gleam in her eyes as she had said that poison was a\\nwoman’s weapon. how agitated she had been on that fatal tuesday\\nevening! had mrs. inglethorp discovered something between her and\\nbauerstein, and threatened to tell her husband? was it to stop that\\ndenunciation that the crime had been committed?\\n\\nthen i remembered that enigmatical conversation between poirot and\\nevelyn howard. was this what they had meant? was this the monstrous\\npossibility that evelyn had tried not to believe?\\n\\nyes, it all fitted in.\\n\\nno wonder miss howard had suggested “hushing it up.” now i understood\\nthat unfinished sentence of hers: “emily herself——” and in my heart i\\nagreed with her. would not mrs. inglethorp have preferred to go\\nunavenged rather than have such terrible dishonour fall upon the name\\nof cavendish.\\n\\n“there’s another thing,” said john suddenly, and the unexpected sound\\nof his voice made me start guiltily. “something which makes me doubt if\\nwhat you say can be true.”\\n\\n“what’s that?” i asked, thankful that he had gone away from the subject\\nof how the poison could have been introduced into the cocoa.\\n\\n“why, the fact that bauerstein demanded a post-mortem. he needn’t have\\ndone so. little wilkins would have been quite content to let it go at\\nheart disease.”\\n\\n“yes,” i said doubtfully. “but we don’t know. perhaps he thought it\\nsafer in the long run. someone might have talked afterwards. then the\\nhome office might have ordered exhumation. the whole thing would have\\ncome out, then, and he would have been in an awkward position, for no\\none would have believed that a man of his reputation could have been\\ndeceived into calling it heart disease.”\\n\\n“yes, that’s possible,” admitted john. “still,” he added, “i’m blest if\\ni can see what his motive could have been.”\\n\\ni trembled.\\n\\n“look here,” i said, “i may be altogether wrong. and, remember, all\\nthis is in confidence.”\\n\\n“oh, of course—that goes without saying.”\\n\\nwe had walked, as we talked, and now we passed through the little gate\\ninto the garden. voices rose near at hand, for tea was spread out under\\nthe sycamore-tree, as it had been on the day of my arrival.\\n\\ncynthia was back from the hospital, and i placed my chair beside her,\\nand told her of poirot’s wish to visit the dispensary.\\n\\n“of course! i’d love him to see it. he’d better come to tea there one\\nday. i must fix it up with him. he’s such a dear little man! but he\\n_is_ funny. he made me take the brooch out of my tie the other day, and\\nput it in again, because he said it wasn’t straight.”\\n\\ni laughed.\\n\\n“it’s quite a mania with him.”\\n\\n“yes, isn’t it?”\\n\\nwe were silent for a minute or two, and then, glancing in the direction\\nof mary cavendish, and dropping her voice, cynthia said:\\n\\n“mr. hastings.”\\n\\n“yes?”\\n\\n“after tea, i want to talk to you.”\\n\\nher glance at mary had set me thinking. i fancied that between these\\ntwo there existed very little sympathy. for the first time, it occurred\\nto me to wonder about the girl’s future. mrs. inglethorp had made no\\nprovisions of any kind for her, but i imagined that john and mary would\\nprobably insist on her making her home with them—at any rate until the\\nend of the war. john, i knew, was very fond of her, and would be sorry\\nto let her go.\\n\\njohn, who had gone into the house, now reappeared. his good-natured\\nface wore an unaccustomed frown of anger.\\n\\n“confound those detectives! i can’t think what they’re after! they’ve\\nbeen in every room in the house—turning things inside out, and upside\\ndown. it really is too bad! i suppose they took advantage of our all\\nbeing out. i shall go for that fellow japp, when i next see him!”\\n\\n“lot of paul prys,” grunted miss howard.\\n\\nlawrence opined that they had to make a show of doing something.\\n\\nmary cavendish said nothing.\\n\\nafter tea, i invited cynthia to come for a walk, and we sauntered off\\ninto the woods together.\\n\\n“well?” i inquired, as soon as we were protected from prying eyes by\\nthe leafy screen.\\n\\nwith a sigh, cynthia flung herself down, and tossed off her hat. the\\nsunlight, piercing through the branches, turned the auburn of her hair\\nto quivering gold.\\n\\n“mr. hastings—you are always so kind, and you know such a lot.”\\n\\nit struck me at this moment that cynthia was really a very charming\\ngirl! much more charming than mary, who never said things of that kind.\\n\\n“well?” i asked benignantly, as she hesitated.\\n\\n“i want to ask your advice. what shall i do?”\\n\\n“do?”\\n\\n“yes. you see, aunt emily always told me i should be provided for. i\\nsuppose she forgot, or didn’t think she was likely to die—anyway, i am\\n_not_ provided for! and i don’t know what to do. do you think i ought\\nto go away from here at once?”\\n\\n“good heavens, no! they don’t want to part with you, i’m sure.”\\n\\ncynthia hesitated a moment, plucking up the grass with her tiny hands.\\nthen she said: “mrs. cavendish does. she hates me.”\\n\\n“hates you?” i cried, astonished.\\n\\ncynthia nodded.\\n\\n“yes. i don’t know why, but she can’t bear me; and _he_ can’t, either.”\\n\\n“there i know you’re wrong,” i said warmly. “on the contrary, john is\\nvery fond of you.”\\n\\n“oh, yes—_john_. i meant lawrence. not, of course, that i care whether\\nlawrence hates me or not. still, it’s rather horrid when no one loves\\nyou, isn’t it?”\\n\\n“but they do, cynthia dear,” i said earnestly. “i’m sure you are\\nmistaken. look, there is john—and miss howard——”\\n\\ncynthia nodded rather gloomily. “yes, john likes me, i think, and of\\ncourse evie, for all her gruff ways, wouldn’t be unkind to a fly. but\\nlawrence never speaks to me if he can help it, and mary can hardly\\nbring herself to be civil to me. she wants evie to stay on, is begging\\nher to, but she doesn’t want me, and—and—i don’t know what to do.”\\nsuddenly the poor child burst out crying.\\n\\ni don’t know what possessed me. her beauty, perhaps, as she sat there,\\nwith the sunlight glinting down on her head; perhaps the sense of\\nrelief at encountering someone who so obviously could have no\\nconnection with the tragedy; perhaps honest pity for her youth and\\nloneliness. anyway, i leant forward, and taking her little hand, i said\\nawkwardly:\\n\\n“marry me, cynthia.”\\n\\nunwittingly, i had hit upon a sovereign remedy for her tears. she sat\\nup at once, drew her hand away, and said, with some asperity:\\n\\n“don’t be silly!”\\n\\ni was a little annoyed.\\n\\n“i’m not being silly. i am asking you to do me the honour of becoming\\nmy wife.”\\n\\nto my intense surprise, cynthia burst out laughing, and called me a\\n“funny dear.”\\n\\n“it’s perfectly sweet of you,” she said, “but you know you don’t want\\nto!”\\n\\n“yes, i do. i’ve got——”\\n\\n“never mind what you’ve got. you don’t really want to—and i don’t\\neither.”\\n\\n“well, of course, that settles it,” i said stiffly. “but i don’t see\\nanything to laugh at. there’s nothing funny about a proposal.”\\n\\n“no, indeed,” said cynthia. “somebody might accept you next time.\\ngood-bye, you’ve cheered me up _very_ much.”\\n\\nand, with a final uncontrollable burst of merriment, she vanished\\nthrough the trees.\\n\\nthinking over the interview, it struck me as being profoundly\\nunsatisfactory.\\n\\nit occurred to me suddenly that i would go down to the village, and\\nlook up bauerstein. somebody ought to be keeping an eye on the fellow.\\nat the same time, it would be wise to allay any suspicions he might\\nhave as to his being suspected. i remembered how poirot had relied on\\nmy diplomacy. accordingly, i went to the little house with the\\n“apartments” card inserted in the window, where i knew he lodged, and\\ntapped on the door.\\n\\nan old woman came and opened it.\\n\\n“good afternoon,” i said pleasantly. “is dr. bauerstein in?”\\n\\nshe stared at me.\\n\\n“haven’t you heard?”\\n\\n“heard what?”\\n\\n“about him.”\\n\\n“what about him?”\\n\\n“he’s took.”\\n\\n“took? dead?”\\n\\n“no, took by the perlice.”\\n\\n“by the police!” i gasped. “do you mean they’ve arrested him?”\\n\\n“yes, that’s it, and——”\\n\\ni waited to hear no more, but tore up the village to find poirot.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter x.\\nthe arrest\\n\\n\\nto my extreme annoyance, poirot was not in, and the old belgian who\\nanswered my knock informed me that he believed he had gone to london.\\n\\ni was dumbfounded. what on earth could poirot be doing in london! was\\nit a sudden decision on his part, or had he already made up his mind\\nwhen he parted from me a few hours earlier?\\n\\ni retraced my steps to styles in some annoyance. with poirot away, i\\nwas uncertain how to act. had he foreseen this arrest? had he not, in\\nall probability, been the cause of it? those questions i could not\\nresolve. but in the meantime what was i to do? should i announce the\\narrest openly at styles, or not? though i did not acknowledge it to\\nmyself, the thought of mary cavendish was weighing on me. would it not\\nbe a terrible shock to her? for the moment, i set aside utterly any\\nsuspicions of her. she could not be implicated—otherwise i should have\\nheard some hint of it.\\n\\nof course, there was no possibility of being able permanently to\\nconceal dr. bauerstein’s arrest from her. it would be announced in\\nevery newspaper on the morrow. still, i shrank from blurting it out. if\\nonly poirot had been accessible, i could have asked his advice. what\\npossessed him to go posting off to london in this unaccountable way?\\n\\nin spite of myself, my opinion of his sagacity was immeasurably\\nheightened. i would never have dreamt of suspecting the doctor, had not\\npoirot put it into my head. yes, decidedly, the little man was clever.\\n\\nafter some reflecting, i decided to take john into my confidence, and\\nleave him to make the matter public or not, as he thought fit.\\n\\nhe gave vent to a prodigious whistle, as i imparted the news.\\n\\n“great scott! you _were_ right, then. i couldn’t believe it at the\\ntime.”\\n\\n“no, it is astonishing until you get used to the idea, and see how it\\nmakes everything fit in. now, what are we to do? of course, it will be\\ngenerally known to-morrow.”\\n\\njohn reflected.\\n\\n“never mind,” he said at last, “we won’t say anything at present. there\\nis no need. as you say, it will be known soon enough.”\\n\\nbut to my intense surprise, on getting down early the next morning, and\\neagerly opening the newspapers, there was not a word about the arrest!\\nthere was a column of mere padding about “the styles poisoning case,”\\nbut nothing further. it was rather inexplicable, but i supposed that,\\nfor some reason or other, japp wished to keep it out of the papers. it\\nworried me just a little, for it suggested the possibility that there\\nmight be further arrests to come.\\n\\nafter breakfast, i decided to go down to the village, and see if poirot\\nhad returned yet; but, before i could start, a well-known face blocked\\none of the windows, and the well-known voice said:\\n\\n“_bonjour, mon ami!_”\\n\\n“poirot,” i exclaimed, with relief, and seizing him by both hands, i\\ndragged him into the room. “i was never so glad to see anyone. listen,\\ni have said nothing to anybody but john. is that right?”\\n\\n“my friend,” replied poirot, “i do not know what you are talking\\nabout.”\\n\\n“dr. bauerstein’s arrest, of course,” i answered impatiently.\\n\\n“is bauerstein arrested, then?”\\n\\n“did you not know it?”\\n\\n“not the least in the world.” but, pausing a moment, he added: “still,\\nit does not surprise me. after all, we are only four miles from the\\ncoast.”\\n\\n“the coast?” i asked, puzzled. “what has that got to do with it?”\\n\\npoirot shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n“surely, it is obvious!”\\n\\n“not to me. no doubt i am very dense, but i cannot see what the\\nproximity of the coast has got to do with the murder of mrs.\\ninglethorp.”\\n\\n“nothing at all, of course,” replied poirot, smiling. “but we were\\nspeaking of the arrest of dr. bauerstein.”\\n\\n“well, he is arrested for the murder of mrs. inglethorp——”\\n\\n“what?” cried poirot, in apparently lively astonishment. “dr.\\nbauerstein arrested for the murder of mrs. inglethorp?”\\n\\n“yes.”\\n\\n“impossible! that would be too good a farce! who told you that, my\\nfriend?”\\n\\n“well, no one exactly told me,” i confessed. “but he is arrested.”\\n\\n“oh, yes, very likely. but for espionage, _mon ami_.”\\n\\n“espionage?” i gasped.\\n\\n“precisely.”\\n\\n“not for poisoning mrs. inglethorp?”\\n\\n“not unless our friend japp has taken leave of his senses,” replied\\npoirot placidly.\\n\\n“but—but i thought you thought so too?”\\n\\npoirot gave me one look, which conveyed a wondering pity, and his full\\nsense of the utter absurdity of such an idea.\\n\\n“do you mean to say,” i asked, slowly adapting myself to the new idea,\\n“that dr. bauerstein is a spy?”\\n\\npoirot nodded.\\n\\n“have you never suspected it?”\\n\\n“it never entered my head.”\\n\\n“it did not strike you as peculiar that a famous london doctor should\\nbury himself in a little village like this, and should be in the habit\\nof walking about at all hours of the night, fully dressed?”\\n\\n“no,” i confessed, “i never thought of such a thing.”\\n\\n“he is, of course, a german by birth,” said poirot thoughtfully,\\n“though he has practised so long in this country that nobody thinks of\\nhim as anything but an englishman. he was naturalized about fifteen\\nyears ago. a very clever man—a jew, of course.”\\n\\n“the blackguard!” i cried indignantly.\\n\\n“not at all. he is, on the contrary, a patriot. think what he stands to\\nlose. i admire the man myself.”\\n\\nbut i could not look at it in poirot’s philosophical way.\\n\\n“and this is the man with whom mrs. cavendish has been wandering about\\nall over the country!” i cried indignantly.\\n\\n“yes. i should fancy he had found her very useful,” remarked poirot.\\n“so long as gossip busied itself in coupling their names together, any\\nother vagaries of the doctor’s passed unobserved.”\\n\\n“then you think he never really cared for her?” i asked eagerly—rather\\ntoo eagerly, perhaps, under the circumstances.\\n\\n“that, of course, i cannot say, but—shall i tell you my own private\\nopinion, hastings?”\\n\\n“yes.”\\n\\n“well, it is this: that mrs. cavendish does not care, and never has\\ncared one little jot about dr. bauerstein!”\\n\\n“do you really think so?” i could not disguise my pleasure.\\n\\n“i am quite sure of it. and i will tell you why.”\\n\\n“yes?”\\n\\n“because she cares for someone else, _mon ami_.”\\n\\n“oh!” what did he mean? in spite of myself, an agreeable warmth spread\\nover me. i am not a vain man where women are concerned, but i\\nremembered certain evidences, too lightly thought of at the time,\\nperhaps, but which certainly seemed to indicate——\\n\\nmy pleasing thoughts were interrupted by the sudden entrance of miss\\nhoward. she glanced round hastily to make sure there was no one else in\\nthe room, and quickly produced an old sheet of brown paper. this she\\nhanded to poirot, murmuring as she did so the cryptic words:\\n\\n“on top of the wardrobe.” then she hurriedly left the room.\\n\\npoirot unfolded the sheet of paper eagerly, and uttered an exclamation\\nof satisfaction. he spread it out on the table.\\n\\n“come here, hastings. now tell me, what is that initial—j. or l.?”\\n\\nit was a medium sized sheet of paper, rather dusty, as though it had\\nlain by for some time. but it was the label that was attracting\\npoirot’s attention. at the top, it bore the printed stamp of messrs.\\nparkson’s, the well-known theatrical costumiers, and it was addressed\\nto “—(the debatable initial) cavendish, esq., styles court, styles st.\\nmary, essex.”\\n\\n“it might be t., or it might be l.,” i said, after studying the thing\\nfor a minute or two. “it certainly isn’t a j.”\\n\\n“good,” replied poirot, folding up the paper again. “i, also, am of\\nyour way of thinking. it is an l., depend upon it!”\\n\\n“where did it come from?” i asked curiously. “is it important?”\\n\\n“moderately so. it confirms a surmise of mine. having deduced its\\nexistence, i set miss howard to search for it, and, as you see, she has\\nbeen successful.”\\n\\n“what did she mean by ‘on the top of the wardrobe’?”\\n\\n“she meant,” replied poirot promptly, “that she found it on top of a\\nwardrobe.”\\n\\n“a funny place for a piece of brown paper,” i mused.\\n\\n“not at all. the top of a wardrobe is an excellent place for brown\\npaper and cardboard boxes. i have kept them there myself. neatly\\narranged, there is nothing to offend the eye.”\\n\\n“poirot,” i asked earnestly, “have you made up your mind about this\\ncrime?”\\n\\n“yes—that is to say, i believe i know how it was committed.”\\n\\n“ah!”\\n\\n“unfortunately, i have no proof beyond my surmise, unless——” with\\nsudden energy, he caught me by the arm, and whirled me down the hall,\\ncalling out in french in his excitement: “mademoiselle dorcas,\\nmademoiselle dorcas, _un moment, s’il vous plaît!_”\\n\\ndorcas, quite flurried by the noise, came hurrying out of the pantry.\\n\\n“my good dorcas, i have an idea—a little idea—if it should prove\\njustified, what magnificent chance! tell me, on monday, not tuesday,\\ndorcas, but monday, the day before the tragedy, did anything go wrong\\nwith mrs. inglethorp’s bell?”\\n\\ndorcas looked very surprised.\\n\\n“yes, sir, now you mention it, it did; though i don’t know how you came\\nto hear of it. a mouse, or some such, must have nibbled the wire\\nthrough. the man came and put it right on tuesday morning.”\\n\\nwith a long drawn exclamation of ecstasy, poirot led the way back to\\nthe morning-room.\\n\\n“see you, one should not ask for outside proof—no, reason should be\\nenough. but the flesh is weak, it is consolation to find that one is on\\nthe right track. ah, my friend, i am like a giant refreshed. i run! i\\nleap!”\\n\\nand, in very truth, run and leap he did, gambolling wildly down the\\nstretch of lawn outside the long window.\\n\\n“what is your remarkable little friend doing?” asked a voice behind me,\\nand i turned to find mary cavendish at my elbow. she smiled, and so did\\ni. “what is it all about?”\\n\\n“really, i can’t tell you. he asked dorcas some question about a bell,\\nand appeared so delighted with her answer that he is capering about as\\nyou see!”\\n\\nmary laughed.\\n\\n“how ridiculous! he’s going out of the gate. isn’t he coming back\\nto-day?”\\n\\n“i don’t know. i’ve given up trying to guess what he’ll do next.”\\n\\n“is he quite mad, mr. hastings?”\\n\\n“i honestly don’t know. sometimes, i feel sure he is as mad as a\\nhatter; and then, just as he is at his maddest, i find there is method\\nin his madness.”\\n\\n“i see.”\\n\\nin spite of her laugh, mary was looking thoughtful this morning. she\\nseemed grave, almost sad.\\n\\nit occurred to me that it would be a good opportunity to tackle her on\\nthe subject of cynthia. i began rather tactfully, _i_ thought, but i\\nhad not gone far before she stopped me authoritatively.\\n\\n“you are an excellent advocate, i have no doubt, mr. hastings, but in\\nthis case your talents are quite thrown away. cynthia will run no risk\\nof encountering any unkindness from me.”\\n\\ni began to stammer feebly that i hoped she hadn’t thought—— but again\\nshe stopped me, and her words were so unexpected that they quite drove\\ncynthia, and her troubles, out of my mind.\\n\\n“mr. hastings,” she said, “do you think i and my husband are happy\\ntogether?”\\n\\ni was considerably taken aback, and murmured something about it’s not\\nbeing my business to think anything of the sort.\\n\\n“well,” she said quietly, “whether it is your business or not, i will\\ntell you that we are _not_ happy.”\\n\\ni said nothing, for i saw that she had not finished.\\n\\nshe began slowly, walking up and down the room, her head a little bent,\\nand that slim, supple figure of hers swaying gently as she walked. she\\nstopped suddenly, and looked up at me.\\n\\n“you don’t know anything about me, do you?” she asked. “where i come\\nfrom, who i was before i married john—anything, in fact? well, i will\\ntell you. i will make a father confessor of you. you are kind, i\\nthink—yes, i am sure you are kind.”\\n\\nsomehow, i was not quite as elated as i might have been. i remembered\\nthat cynthia had begun her confidences in much the same way. besides, a\\nfather confessor should be elderly, it is not at all the role for a\\nyoung man.\\n\\n“my father was english,” said mrs. cavendish, “but my mother was a\\nrussian.”\\n\\n“ah,” i said, “now i understand——”\\n\\n“understand what?”\\n\\n“a hint of something foreign—different—that there has always been about\\nyou.”\\n\\n“my mother was very beautiful, i believe. i don’t know, because i never\\nsaw her. she died when i was quite a little child. i believe there was\\nsome tragedy connected with her death—she took an overdose of some\\nsleeping draught by mistake. however that may be, my father was\\nbroken-hearted. shortly afterwards, he went into the consular service.\\neverywhere he went, i went with him. when i was twenty-three, i had\\nbeen nearly all over the world. it was a splendid life—i loved it.”\\n\\nthere was a smile on her face, and her head was thrown back. she seemed\\nliving in the memory of those old glad days.\\n\\n“then my father died. he left me very badly off. i had to go and live\\nwith some old aunts in yorkshire.” she shuddered. “you will understand\\nme when i say that it was a deadly life for a girl brought up as i had\\nbeen. the narrowness, the deadly monotony of it, almost drove me mad.”\\nshe paused a minute, and added in a different tone: “and then i met\\njohn cavendish.”\\n\\n“yes?”\\n\\n“you can imagine that, from my aunts’ point of view, it was a very good\\nmatch for me. but i can honestly say it was not this fact which weighed\\nwith me. no, he was simply a way of escape from the insufferable\\nmonotony of my life.”\\n\\ni said nothing, and after a moment, she went on:\\n\\n“don’t misunderstand me. i was quite honest with him. i told him, what\\nwas true, that i liked him very much, that i hoped to come to like him\\nmore, but that i was not in any way what the world calls ‘in love’ with\\nhim. he declared that that satisfied him, and so—we were married.”\\n\\nshe waited a long time, a little frown had gathered on her forehead.\\nshe seemed to be looking back earnestly into those past days.\\n\\n“i think—i am sure—he cared for me at first. but i suppose we were not\\nwell matched. almost at once, we drifted apart. he—it is not a pleasing\\nthing for my pride, but it is the truth—tired of me very soon.” i must\\nhave made some murmur of dissent, for she went on quickly: “oh, yes, he\\ndid! not that it matters now—now that we’ve come to the parting of the\\nways.”\\n\\n“what do you mean?”\\n\\nshe answered quietly:\\n\\n“i mean that i am not going to remain at styles.”\\n\\n“you and john are not going to live here?”\\n\\n“john may live here, but i shall not.”\\n\\n“you are going to leave him?”\\n\\n“yes.”\\n\\n“but why?”\\n\\nshe paused a long time, and said at last:\\n\\n“perhaps—because i want to be—free!”\\n\\nand, as she spoke, i had a sudden vision of broad spaces, virgin tracts\\nof forests, untrodden lands—and a realization of what freedom would\\nmean to such a nature as mary cavendish. i seemed to see her for a\\nmoment as she was, a proud wild creature, as untamed by civilization as\\nsome shy bird of the hills. a little cry broke from her lips:\\n\\n“you don’t know, you don’t know, how this hateful place has been prison\\nto me!”\\n\\n“i understand,” i said, “but—but don’t do anything rash.”\\n\\n“oh, rash!” her voice mocked at my prudence.\\n\\nthen suddenly i said a thing i could have bitten out my tongue for:\\n\\n“you know that dr. bauerstein has been arrested?”\\n\\nan instant coldness passed like a mask over her face, blotting out all\\nexpression.\\n\\n“john was so kind as to break that to me this morning.”\\n\\n“well, what do you think?” i asked feebly.\\n\\n“of what?”\\n\\n“of the arrest?”\\n\\n“what should i think? apparently he is a german spy; so the gardener\\nhad told john.”\\n\\nher face and voice were absolutely cold and expressionless. did she\\ncare, or did she not?\\n\\nshe moved away a step or two, and fingered one of the flower vases.\\n\\n“these are quite dead. i must do them again. would you mind\\nmoving—thank you, mr. hastings.” and she walked quietly past me out of\\nthe window, with a cool little nod of dismissal.\\n\\nno, surely she could not care for bauerstein. no woman could act her\\npart with that icy unconcern.\\n\\npoirot did not make his appearance the following morning, and there was\\nno sign of the scotland yard men.\\n\\nbut, at lunch-time, there arrived a new piece of evidence—or rather\\nlack of evidence. we had vainly tried to trace the fourth letter, which\\nmrs. inglethorp had written on the evening preceding her death. our\\nefforts having been in vain, we had abandoned the matter, hoping that\\nit might turn up of itself one day. and this is just what did happen,\\nin the shape of a communication, which arrived by the second post from\\na firm of french music publishers, acknowledging mrs. inglethorp’s\\ncheque, and regretting they had been unable to trace a certain series\\nof russian folksongs. so the last hope of solving the mystery, by means\\nof mrs. inglethorp’s correspondence on the fatal evening, had to be\\nabandoned.\\n\\njust before tea, i strolled down to tell poirot of the new\\ndisappointment, but found, to my annoyance, that he was once more out.\\n\\n“gone to london again?”\\n\\n“oh, no, monsieur, he has but taken the train to tadminster. ‘to see a\\nyoung lady’s dispensary,’ he said.”\\n\\n“silly ass!” i ejaculated. “i told him wednesday was the one day she\\nwasn’t there! well, tell him to look us up to-morrow morning, will\\nyou?”\\n\\n“certainly, monsieur.”\\n\\nbut, on the following day, no sign of poirot. i was getting angry. he\\nwas really treating us in the most cavalier fashion.\\n\\nafter lunch, lawrence drew me aside, and asked if i was going down to\\nsee him.\\n\\n“no, i don’t think i shall. he can come up here if he wants to see us.”\\n\\n“oh!” lawrence looked indeterminate. something unusually nervous and\\nexcited in his manner roused my curiosity.\\n\\n“what is it?” i asked. “i could go if there’s anything special.”\\n\\n“it’s nothing much, but—well, if you are going, will you tell him——” he\\ndropped his voice to a whisper—“i think i’ve found the extra\\ncoffee-cup!”\\n\\ni had almost forgotten that enigmatical message of poirot’s, but now my\\ncuriosity was aroused afresh.\\n\\nlawrence would say no more, so i decided that i would descend from my\\nhigh horse, and once more seek out poirot at leastways cottage.\\n\\nthis time i was received with a smile. monsieur poirot was within.\\nwould i mount? i mounted accordingly.\\n\\npoirot was sitting by the table, his head buried in his hands. he\\nsprang up at my entrance.\\n\\n“what is it?” i asked solicitously. “you are not ill, i trust?”\\n\\n“no, no, not ill. but i decide an affair of great moment.”\\n\\n“whether to catch the criminal or not?” i asked facetiously.\\n\\nbut, to my great surprise, poirot nodded gravely.\\n\\n“‘to speak or not to speak,’ as your so great shakespeare says, ‘that\\nis the question.’”\\n\\ni did not trouble to correct the quotation.\\n\\n“you are not serious, poirot?”\\n\\n“i am of the most serious. for the most serious of all things hangs in\\nthe balance.”\\n\\n“and that is?”\\n\\n“a woman’s happiness, _mon ami_,” he said gravely.\\n\\ni did not quite know what to say.\\n\\n“the moment has come,” said poirot thoughtfully, “and i do not know\\nwhat to do. for, see you, it is a big stake for which i play. no one\\nbut i, hercule poirot, would attempt it!” and he tapped himself proudly\\non the breast.\\n\\nafter pausing a few minutes respectfully, so as not to spoil his\\neffect, i gave him lawrence’s message.\\n\\n“aha!” he cried. “so he has found the extra coffee-cup. that is good.\\nhe has more intelligence than would appear, this long-faced monsieur\\nlawrence of yours!”\\n\\ni did not myself think very highly of lawrence’s intelligence; but i\\nforebore to contradict poirot, and gently took him to task for\\nforgetting my instructions as to which were cynthia’s days off.\\n\\n“it is true. i have the head of a sieve. however, the other young lady\\nwas most kind. she was sorry for my disappointment, and showed me\\neverything in the kindest way.”\\n\\n“oh, well, that’s all right, then, and you must go to tea with cynthia\\nanother day.”\\n\\ni told him about the letter.\\n\\n“i am sorry for that,” he said. “i always had hopes of that letter. but\\nno, it was not to be. this affair must all be unravelled from within.”\\nhe tapped his forehead. “these little grey cells. it is ‘up to them’—as\\nyou say over here.” then, suddenly, he asked: “are you a judge of\\nfinger-marks, my friend?”\\n\\n“no,” i said, rather surprised, “i know that there are no two\\nfinger-marks alike, but that’s as far as my science goes.”\\n\\n“exactly.”\\n\\nhe unlocked a little drawer, and took out some photographs which he\\nlaid on the table.\\n\\n“i have numbered them, 1, 2, 3. will you describe them to me?”\\n\\ni studied the proofs attentively.\\n\\n“all greatly magnified, i see. no. 1, i should say, are a man’s\\nfinger-prints; thumb and first finger. no. 2 are a lady’s; they are\\nmuch smaller, and quite different in every way. no. 3”—i paused for\\nsome time—“there seem to be a lot of confused finger-marks, but here,\\nvery distinctly, are no. 1’s.”\\n\\n“overlapping the others?”\\n\\n“yes.”\\n\\n“you recognize them beyond fail?”\\n\\n“oh, yes; they are identical.”\\n\\npoirot nodded, and gently taking the photographs from me locked them up\\nagain.\\n\\n“i suppose,” i said, “that as usual, you are not going to explain?”\\n\\n“on the contrary. no. 1 were the finger-prints of monsieur lawrence.\\nno. 2 were those of mademoiselle cynthia. they are not important. i\\nmerely obtained them for comparison. no. 3 is a little more\\ncomplicated.”\\n\\n“yes?”\\n\\n“it is, as you see, highly magnified. you may have noticed a sort of\\nblur extending all across the picture. i will not describe to you the\\nspecial apparatus, dusting powder, etc., which i used. it is a\\nwell-known process to the police, and by means of it you can obtain a\\nphotograph of the finger-prints of any object in a very short space of\\ntime. well, my friend, you have seen the finger-marks—it remains to\\ntell you the particular object on which they had been left.”\\n\\n“go on—i am really excited.”\\n\\n“_eh bien!_ photo no. 3 represents the highly magnified surface of a\\ntiny bottle in the top poison cupboard of the dispensary in the red\\ncross hospital at tadminster—which sounds like the house that jack\\nbuilt!”\\n\\n“good heavens!” i exclaimed. “but what were lawrence cavendish’s\\nfinger-marks doing on it? he never went near the poison cupboard the\\nday we were there!”\\n\\n“oh, yes, he did!”\\n\\n“impossible! we were all together the whole time.”\\n\\npoirot shook his head.\\n\\n“no, my friend, there was a moment when you were not all together.\\nthere was a moment when you could not have been all together, or it\\nwould not have been necessary to call to monsieur lawrence to come and\\njoin you on the balcony.”\\n\\n“i’d forgotten that,” i admitted. “but it was only for a moment.”\\n\\n“long enough.”\\n\\n“long enough for what?”\\n\\npoirot’s smile became rather enigmatical.\\n\\n“long enough for a gentleman who had once studied medicine to gratify a\\nvery natural interest and curiosity.”\\n\\nour eyes met. poirot’s were pleasantly vague. he got up and hummed a\\nlittle tune. i watched him suspiciously.\\n\\n“poirot,” i said, “what was in this particular little bottle?”\\n\\npoirot looked out of the window.\\n\\n“hydro-chloride of strychnine,” he said, over his shoulder, continuing\\nto hum.\\n\\n“good heavens!” i said it quite quietly. i was not surprised. i had\\nexpected that answer.\\n\\n“they use the pure hydro-chloride of strychnine very little—only\\noccasionally for pills. it is the official solution, liq. strychnine\\nhydro-clor. that is used in most medicines. that is why the\\nfinger-marks have remained undisturbed since then.”\\n\\n“how did you manage to take this photograph?”\\n\\n“i dropped my hat from the balcony,” explained poirot simply. “visitors\\nwere not permitted below at that hour, so, in spite of my many\\napologies, mademoiselle cynthia’s colleague had to go down and fetch it\\nfor me.”\\n\\n“then you knew what you were going to find?”\\n\\n“no, not at all. i merely realized that it was possible, from your\\nstory, for monsieur lawrence to go to the poison cupboard. the\\npossibility had to be confirmed, or eliminated.”\\n\\n“poirot,” i said, “your gaiety does not deceive me. this is a very\\nimportant discovery.”\\n\\n“i do not know,” said poirot. “but one thing does strike me. no doubt\\nit has struck you too.”\\n\\n“what is that?”\\n\\n“why, that there is altogether too much strychnine about this case.\\nthis is the third time we run up against it. there was strychnine in\\nmrs. inglethorp’s tonic. there is the strychnine sold across the\\ncounter at styles st. mary by mace. now we have more strychnine,\\nhandled by one of the household. it is confusing; and, as you know, i\\ndo not like confusion.”\\n\\nbefore i could reply, one of the other belgians opened the door and\\nstuck his head in.\\n\\n“there is a lady below, asking for mr hastings.”\\n\\n“a lady?”\\n\\ni jumped up. poirot followed me down the narrow stairs. mary cavendish\\nwas standing in the doorway.\\n\\n“i have been visiting an old woman in the village,” she explained, “and\\nas lawrence told me you were with monsieur poirot i thought i would\\ncall for you.”\\n\\n“alas, madame,” said poirot, “i thought you had come to honour me with\\na visit!”\\n\\n“i will some day, if you ask me,” she promised him, smiling.\\n\\n“that is well. if you should need a father confessor, madame”—she\\nstarted ever so slightly—“remember, papa poirot is always at your\\nservice.”\\n\\nshe stared at him for a few minutes, as though seeking to read some\\ndeeper meaning into his words. then she turned abruptly away.\\n\\n“come, will you not walk back with us too, monsieur poirot?”\\n\\n“enchanted, madame.”\\n\\nall the way to styles, mary talked fast and feverishly. it struck me\\nthat in some way she was nervous of poirot’s eyes.\\n\\nthe weather had broken, and the sharp wind was almost autumnal in its\\nshrewishness. mary shivered a little, and buttoned her black sports\\ncoat closer. the wind through the trees made a mournful noise, like\\nsome great giant sighing.\\n\\nwe walked up to the great door of styles, and at once the knowledge\\ncame to us that something was wrong.\\n\\ndorcas came running out to meet us. she was crying and wringing her\\nhands. i was aware of other servants huddled together in the\\nbackground, all eyes and ears.\\n\\n“oh, m’am! oh, m’am! i don’t know how to tell you——”\\n\\n“what is it, dorcas?” i asked impatiently. “tell us at once.”\\n\\n“it’s those wicked detectives. they’ve arrested him—they’ve arrested\\nmr. cavendish!”\\n\\n“arrested lawrence?” i gasped.\\n\\ni saw a strange look come into dorcas’s eyes.\\n\\n“no, sir. not mr. lawrence—mr. john.”\\n\\nbehind me, with a wild cry, mary cavendish fell heavily against me, and\\nas i turned to catch her i met the quiet triumph in poirot’s eyes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xi.\\nthe case for the prosecution\\n\\n\\nthe trial of john cavendish for the murder of his stepmother took place\\ntwo months later.\\n\\nof the intervening weeks i will say little, but my admiration and\\nsympathy went out unfeignedly to mary cavendish. she ranged herself\\npassionately on her husband’s side, scorning the mere idea of his\\nguilt, and fought for him tooth and nail.\\n\\ni expressed my admiration to poirot, and he nodded thoughtfully.\\n\\n“yes, she is of those women who show at their best in adversity. it\\nbrings out all that is sweetest and truest in them. her pride and her\\njealousy have——”\\n\\n“jealousy?” i queried.\\n\\n“yes. have you not realized that she is an unusually jealous woman? as\\ni was saying, her pride and jealousy have been laid aside. she thinks\\nof nothing but her husband, and the terrible fate that is hanging over\\nhim.”\\n\\nhe spoke very feelingly, and i looked at him earnestly, remembering\\nthat last afternoon, when he had been deliberating whether or not to\\nspeak. with his tenderness for “a woman’s happiness,” i felt glad that\\nthe decision had been taken out of his hands.\\n\\n“even now,” i said, “i can hardly believe it. you see, up to the very\\nlast minute, i thought it was lawrence!”\\n\\npoirot grinned.\\n\\n“i know you did.”\\n\\n“but john! my old friend john!”\\n\\n“every murderer is probably somebody’s old friend,” observed poirot\\nphilosophically. “you cannot mix up sentiment and reason.”\\n\\n“i must say i think you might have given me a hint.”\\n\\n“perhaps, _mon ami_, i did not do so, just because he _was_ your old\\nfriend.”\\n\\ni was rather disconcerted by this, remembering how i had busily passed\\non to john what i believed to be poirot’s views concerning bauerstein.\\nhe, by the way, had been acquitted of the charge brought against him.\\nnevertheless, although he had been too clever for them this time, and\\nthe charge of espionage could not be brought home to him, his wings\\nwere pretty well clipped for the future.\\n\\ni asked poirot whether he thought john would be condemned. to my\\nintense surprise, he replied that, on the contrary, he was extremely\\nlikely to be acquitted.\\n\\n“but, poirot——” i protested.\\n\\n“oh, my friend, have i not said to you all along that i have no proofs.\\nit is one thing to know that a man is guilty, it is quite another\\nmatter to prove him so. and, in this case, there is terribly little\\nevidence. that is the whole trouble. i, hercule poirot, know, but i\\nlack the last link in my chain. and unless i can find that missing\\nlink——” he shook his head gravely.\\n\\n“when did you first suspect john cavendish?” i asked, after a minute or\\ntwo.\\n\\n“did you not suspect him at all?”\\n\\n“no, indeed.”\\n\\n“not after that fragment of conversation you overheard between mrs.\\ncavendish and her mother-in-law, and her subsequent lack of frankness\\nat the inquest?”\\n\\n“no.”\\n\\n“did you not put two and two together, and reflect that if it was not\\nalfred inglethorp who was quarrelling with his wife—and you remember,\\nhe strenuously denied it at the inquest—it must be either lawrence or\\njohn. now, if it was lawrence, mary cavendish’s conduct was just as\\ninexplicable. but if, on the other hand, it was john, the whole thing\\nwas explained quite naturally.”\\n\\n“so,” i cried, a light breaking in upon me, “it was john who quarrelled\\nwith his mother that afternoon?”\\n\\n“exactly.”\\n\\n“and you have known this all along?”\\n\\n“certainly. mrs. cavendish’s behaviour could only be explained that\\nway.”\\n\\n“and yet you say he may be acquitted?”\\n\\npoirot shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n“certainly i do. at the police court proceedings, we shall hear the\\ncase for the prosecution, but in all probability his solicitors will\\nadvise him to reserve his defence. that will be sprung upon us at the\\ntrial. and—ah, by the way, i have a word of caution to give you, my\\nfriend. i must not appear in the case.”\\n\\n“what?”\\n\\n“no. officially, i have nothing to do with it. until i have found that\\nlast link in my chain, i must remain behind the scenes. mrs. cavendish\\nmust think i am working for her husband, not against him.”\\n\\n“i say, that’s playing it a bit low down,” i protested.\\n\\n“not at all. we have to deal with a most clever and unscrupulous man,\\nand we must use any means in our power—otherwise he will slip through\\nour fingers. that is why i have been careful to remain in the\\nbackground. all the discoveries have been made by japp, and japp will\\ntake all the credit. if i am called upon to give evidence at all”—he\\nsmiled broadly—“it will probably be as a witness for the defence.”\\n\\ni could hardly believe my ears.\\n\\n“it is quite _en règle_,” continued poirot. “strangely enough, i can\\ngive evidence that will demolish one contention of the prosecution.”\\n\\n“which one?”\\n\\n“the one that relates to the destruction of the will. john cavendish\\ndid not destroy that will.”\\n\\npoirot was a true prophet. i will not go into the details of the police\\ncourt proceedings, as it involves many tiresome repetitions. i will\\nmerely state baldly that john cavendish reserved his defence, and was\\nduly committed for trial.\\n\\nseptember found us all in london. mary took a house in kensington,\\npoirot being included in the family party.\\n\\ni myself had been given a job at the war office, so was able to see\\nthem continually.\\n\\nas the weeks went by, the state of poirot’s nerves grew worse and\\nworse. that “last link” he talked about was still lacking. privately, i\\nhoped it might remain so, for what happiness could there be for mary,\\nif john were not acquitted?\\n\\non september 15th john cavendish appeared in the dock at the old\\nbailey, charged with “the wilful murder of emily agnes inglethorp,” and\\npleaded “not guilty.”\\n\\nsir ernest heavywether, the famous k.c., had been engaged to defend\\nhim.\\n\\nmr. philips, k.c., opened the case for the crown.\\n\\nthe murder, he said, was a most premeditated and cold-blooded one. it\\nwas neither more nor less than the deliberate poisoning of a fond and\\ntrusting woman by the stepson to whom she had been more than a mother.\\never since his boyhood, she had supported him. he and his wife had\\nlived at styles court in every luxury, surrounded by her care and\\nattention. she had been their kind and generous benefactress.\\n\\nhe proposed to call witnesses to show how the prisoner, a profligate\\nand spendthrift, had been at the end of his financial tether, and had\\nalso been carrying on an intrigue with a certain mrs. raikes, a\\nneighbouring farmer’s wife. this having come to his stepmother’s ears,\\nshe taxed him with it on the afternoon before her death, and a quarrel\\nensued, part of which was overheard. on the previous day, the prisoner\\nhad purchased strychnine at the village chemist’s shop, wearing a\\ndisguise by means of which he hoped to throw the onus of the crime upon\\nanother man—to wit, mrs. inglethorp’s husband, of whom he had been\\nbitterly jealous. luckily for mr. inglethorp, he had been able to\\nproduce an unimpeachable alibi.\\n\\non the afternoon of july 17th, continued counsel, immediately after the\\nquarrel with her son, mrs. inglethorp made a new will. this will was\\nfound destroyed in the grate of her bedroom the following morning, but\\nevidence had come to light which showed that it had been drawn up in\\nfavour of her husband. deceased had already made a will in his favour\\nbefore her marriage, but—and mr. philips wagged an expressive\\nforefinger—the prisoner was not aware of that. what had induced the\\ndeceased to make a fresh will, with the old one still extant, he could\\nnot say. she was an old lady, and might possibly have forgotten the\\nformer one; or—this seemed to him more likely—she may have had an idea\\nthat it was revoked by her marriage, as there had been some\\nconversation on the subject. ladies were not always very well versed in\\nlegal knowledge. she had, about a year before, executed a will in\\nfavour of the prisoner. he would call evidence to show that it was the\\nprisoner who ultimately handed his stepmother her coffee on the fatal\\nnight. later in the evening, he had sought admission to her room, on\\nwhich occasion, no doubt, he found an opportunity of destroying the\\nwill which, as far as he knew, would render the one in his favour\\nvalid.\\n\\nthe prisoner had been arrested in consequence of the discovery, in his\\nroom, by detective inspector japp—a most brilliant officer—of the\\nidentical phial of strychnine which had been sold at the village\\nchemist’s to the supposed mr. inglethorp on the day before the murder.\\nit would be for the jury to decide whether or not these damning facts\\nconstituted an overwhelming proof of the prisoner’s guilt.\\n\\nand, subtly implying that a jury which did not so decide, was quite\\nunthinkable, mr. philips sat down and wiped his forehead.\\n\\nthe first witnesses for the prosecution were mostly those who had been\\ncalled at the inquest, the medical evidence being again taken first.\\n\\nsir ernest heavywether, who was famous all over england for the\\nunscrupulous manner in which he bullied witnesses, only asked two\\nquestions.\\n\\n“i take it, dr. bauerstein, that strychnine, as a drug, acts quickly?”\\n\\n“yes.”\\n\\n“and that you are unable to account for the delay in this case?”\\n\\n“yes.”\\n\\n“thank you.”\\n\\nmr. mace identified the phial handed him by counsel as that sold by him\\nto “mr. inglethorp.” pressed, he admitted that he only knew mr.\\ninglethorp by sight. he had never spoken to him. the witness was not\\ncross-examined.\\n\\nalfred inglethorp was called, and denied having purchased the poison.\\nhe also denied having quarrelled with his wife. various witnesses\\ntestified to the accuracy of these statements.\\n\\nthe gardeners’ evidence, as to the witnessing of the will was taken,\\nand then dorcas was called.\\n\\ndorcas, faithful to her “young gentlemen,” denied strenuously that it\\ncould have been john’s voice she heard, and resolutely declared, in the\\nteeth of everything, that it was mr. inglethorp who had been in the\\nboudoir with her mistress. a rather wistful smile passed across the\\nface of the prisoner in the dock. he knew only too well how useless her\\ngallant defiance was, since it was not the object of the defence to\\ndeny this point. mrs. cavendish, of course, could not be called upon to\\ngive evidence against her husband.\\n\\nafter various questions on other matters, mr. philips asked:\\n\\n“in the month of june last, do you remember a parcel arriving for mr.\\nlawrence cavendish from parkson’s?”\\n\\ndorcas shook her head.\\n\\n“i don’t remember, sir. it may have done, but mr. lawrence was away\\nfrom home part of june.”\\n\\n“in the event of a parcel arriving for him whilst he was away, what\\nwould be done with it?”\\n\\n“it would either be put in his room or sent on after him.”\\n\\n“by you?”\\n\\n“no, sir, i should leave it on the hall table. it would be miss howard\\nwho would attend to anything like that.”\\n\\nevelyn howard was called and, after being examined on other points, was\\nquestioned as to the parcel.\\n\\n“don’t remember. lots of parcels come. can’t remember one special one.”\\n\\n“you do not know if it was sent after mr. lawrence cavendish to wales,\\nor whether it was put in his room?”\\n\\n“don’t think it was sent after him. should have remembered it if it\\nwas.”\\n\\n“supposing a parcel arrived addressed to mr. lawrence cavendish, and\\nafterwards it disappeared, should you remark its absence?”\\n\\n“no, don’t think so. i should think someone had taken charge of it.”\\n\\n“i believe, miss howard, that it was you who found this sheet of brown\\npaper?” he held up the same dusty piece which poirot and i had examined\\nin the morning-room at styles.\\n\\n“yes, i did.”\\n\\n“how did you come to look for it?”\\n\\n“the belgian detective who was employed on the case asked me to search\\nfor it.”\\n\\n“where did you eventually discover it?”\\n\\n“on the top of—of—a wardrobe.”\\n\\n“on top of the prisoner’s wardrobe?”\\n\\n“i—i believe so.”\\n\\n“did you not find it yourself?”\\n\\n“yes.”\\n\\n“then you must know where you found it?”\\n\\n“yes, it was on the prisoner’s wardrobe.”\\n\\n“that is better.”\\n\\nan assistant from parkson’s, theatrical costumiers, testified that on\\njune 29th, they had supplied a black beard to mr. l. cavendish, as\\nrequested. it was ordered by letter, and a postal order was enclosed.\\nno, they had not kept the letter. all transactions were entered in\\ntheir books. they had sent the beard, as directed, to “l. cavendish,\\nesq., styles court.”\\n\\nsir ernest heavywether rose ponderously.\\n\\n“where was the letter written from?”\\n\\n“from styles court.”\\n\\n“the same address to which you sent the parcel?”\\n\\n“yes.”\\n\\n“and the letter came from there?”\\n\\n“yes.”\\n\\nlike a beast of prey, heavywether fell upon him:\\n\\n“how do you know?”\\n\\n“i—i don’t understand.”\\n\\n“how do you know that letter came from styles? did you notice the\\npostmark?”\\n\\n“no—but——”\\n\\n“ah, you did _not_ notice the postmark! and yet you affirm so\\nconfidently that it came from styles. it might, in fact, have been any\\npostmark?”\\n\\n“y—es.”\\n\\n“in fact, the letter, though written on stamped notepaper, might have\\nbeen posted from anywhere? from wales, for instance?”\\n\\nthe witness admitted that such might be the case, and sir ernest\\nsignified that he was satisfied.\\n\\nelizabeth wells, second housemaid at styles, stated that after she had\\ngone to bed she remembered that she had bolted the front door, instead\\nof leaving it on the latch as mr. inglethorp had requested. she had\\naccordingly gone downstairs again to rectify her error. hearing a\\nslight noise in the west wing, she had peeped along the passage, and\\nhad seen mr. john cavendish knocking at mrs. inglethorp’s door.\\n\\nsir ernest heavywether made short work of her, and under his unmerciful\\nbullying she contradicted herself hopelessly, and sir ernest sat down\\nagain with a satisfied smile on his face.\\n\\nwith the evidence of annie, as to the candle grease on the floor, and\\nas to seeing the prisoner take the coffee into the boudoir, the\\nproceedings were adjourned until the following day.\\n\\nas we went home, mary cavendish spoke bitterly against the prosecuting\\ncounsel.\\n\\n“that hateful man! what a net he has drawn around my poor john! how he\\ntwisted every little fact until he made it seem what it wasn’t!”\\n\\n“well,” i said consolingly, “it will be the other way about to-morrow.”\\n\\n“yes,” she said meditatively; then suddenly dropped her voice. “mr.\\nhastings, you do not think—surely it could not have been lawrence—oh,\\nno, that could not be!”\\n\\nbut i myself was puzzled, and as soon as i was alone with poirot i\\nasked him what he thought sir ernest was driving at.\\n\\n“ah!” said poirot appreciatively. “he is a clever man, that sir\\nernest.”\\n\\n“do you think he believes lawrence guilty?”\\n\\n“i do not think he believes or cares anything! no, what he is trying\\nfor is to create such confusion in the minds of the jury that they are\\ndivided in their opinion as to which brother did it. he is endeavouring\\nto make out that there is quite as much evidence against lawrence as\\nagainst john—and i am not at all sure that he will not succeed.”\\n\\ndetective-inspector japp was the first witness called when the trial\\nwas reopened, and gave his evidence succinctly and briefly. after\\nrelating the earlier events, he proceeded:\\n\\n“acting on information received, superintendent summerhaye and myself\\nsearched the prisoner’s room, during his temporary absence from the\\nhouse. in his chest of drawers, hidden beneath some underclothing, we\\nfound: first, a pair of gold-rimmed pince-nez similar to those worn by\\nmr. inglethorp”—these were exhibited—“secondly, this phial.”\\n\\nthe phial was that already recognized by the chemist’s assistant, a\\ntiny bottle of blue glass, containing a few grains of a white\\ncrystalline powder, and labelled: “strychnine hydro-chloride. poison.”\\n\\na fresh piece of evidence discovered by the detectives since the police\\ncourt proceedings was a long, almost new piece of blotting-paper. it\\nhad been found in mrs. inglethorp’s cheque book, and on being reversed\\nat a mirror, showed clearly the words: “. . . erything of which i die\\npossessed i leave to my beloved husband alfred ing...” this placed\\nbeyond question the fact that the destroyed will had been in favour of\\nthe deceased lady’s husband. japp then produced the charred fragment of\\npaper recovered from the grate, and this, with the discovery of the\\nbeard in the attic, completed his evidence.\\n\\nbut sir ernest’s cross-examination was yet to come.\\n\\n“what day was it when you searched the prisoner’s room?”\\n\\n“tuesday, the 24th of july.”\\n\\n“exactly a week after the tragedy?”\\n\\n“yes.”\\n\\n“you found these two objects, you say, in the chest of drawers. was the\\ndrawer unlocked?”\\n\\n“yes.”\\n\\n“does it not strike you as unlikely that a man who had committed a\\ncrime should keep the evidence of it in an unlocked drawer for anyone\\nto find?”\\n\\n“he might have stowed them there in a hurry.”\\n\\n“but you have just said it was a whole week since the crime. he would\\nhave had ample time to remove them and destroy them.”\\n\\n“perhaps.”\\n\\n“there is no perhaps about it. would he, or would he not have had\\nplenty of time to remove and destroy them?”\\n\\n“yes.”\\n\\n“was the pile of underclothes under which the things were hidden heavy\\nor light?”\\n\\n“heavyish.”\\n\\n“in other words, it was winter underclothing. obviously, the prisoner\\nwould not be likely to go to that drawer?”\\n\\n“perhaps not.”\\n\\n“kindly answer my question. would the prisoner, in the hottest week of\\na hot summer, be likely to go to a drawer containing winter\\nunderclothing. yes, or no?”\\n\\n“no.”\\n\\n“in that case, is it not possible that the articles in question might\\nhave been put there by a third person, and that the prisoner was quite\\nunaware of their presence?”\\n\\n“i should not think it likely.”\\n\\n“but it is possible?”\\n\\n“yes.”\\n\\n“that is all.”\\n\\nmore evidence followed. evidence as to the financial difficulties in\\nwhich the prisoner had found himself at the end of july. evidence as to\\nhis intrigue with mrs. raikes—poor mary, that must have been bitter\\nhearing for a woman of her pride. evelyn howard had been right in her\\nfacts, though her animosity against alfred inglethorp had caused her to\\njump to the conclusion that he was the person concerned.\\n\\nlawrence cavendish was then put into the box. in a low voice, in answer\\nto mr. philips’ questions, he denied having ordered anything from\\nparkson’s in june. in fact, on june 29th, he had been staying away, in\\nwales.\\n\\ninstantly, sir ernest’s chin was shooting pugnaciously forward.\\n\\n“you deny having ordered a black beard from parkson’s on june 29th?”\\n\\n“i do.”\\n\\n“ah! in the event of anything happening to your brother, who will\\ninherit styles court?”\\n\\nthe brutality of the question called a flush to lawrence’s pale face.\\nthe judge gave vent to a faint murmur of disapprobation, and the\\nprisoner in the dock leant forward angrily.\\n\\nheavywether cared nothing for his client’s anger.\\n\\n“answer my question, if you please.”\\n\\n“i suppose,” said lawrence quietly, “that i should.”\\n\\n“what do you mean by you ‘suppose’? your brother has no children. you\\n_would_ inherit it, wouldn’t you?”\\n\\n“yes.”\\n\\n“ah, that’s better,” said heavywether, with ferocious geniality. “and\\nyou’d inherit a good slice of money too, wouldn’t you?”\\n\\n“really, sir ernest,” protested the judge, “these questions are not\\nrelevant.”\\n\\nsir ernest bowed, and having shot his arrow proceeded.\\n\\n“on tuesday, the 17th july, you went, i believe, with another guest, to\\nvisit the dispensary at the red cross hospital in tadminster?”\\n\\n“yes.”\\n\\n“did you—while you happened to be alone for a few seconds—unlock the\\npoison cupboard, and examine some of the bottles?”\\n\\n“i—i—may have done so.”\\n\\n“i put it to you that you did do so?”\\n\\n“yes.”\\n\\nsir ernest fairly shot the next question at him.\\n\\n“did you examine one bottle in particular?”\\n\\n“no, i do not think so.”\\n\\n“be careful, mr. cavendish. i am referring to a little bottle of\\nhydro-chloride of strychnine.”\\n\\nlawrence was turning a sickly greenish colour.\\n\\n“n—o—i am sure i didn’t.”\\n\\n“then how do you account for the fact that you left the unmistakable\\nimpress of your finger-prints on it?”\\n\\nthe bullying manner was highly efficacious with a nervous disposition.\\n\\n“i—i suppose i must have taken up the bottle.”\\n\\n“i suppose so too! did you abstract any of the contents of the bottle?”\\n\\n“certainly not.”\\n\\n“then why did you take it up?”\\n\\n“i once studied to be a doctor. such things naturally interest me.”\\n\\n“ah! so poisons ‘naturally interest’ you, do they? still, you waited to\\nbe alone before gratifying that ‘interest’ of yours?”\\n\\n“that was pure chance. if the others had been there, i should have done\\njust the same.”\\n\\n“still, as it happens, the others were not there?”\\n\\n“no, but——”\\n\\n“in fact, during the whole afternoon, you were only alone for a couple\\nof minutes, and it happened—i say, it happened—to be during those two\\nminutes that you displayed your ‘natural interest’ in hydro-chloride of\\nstrychnine?”\\n\\nlawrence stammered pitiably.\\n\\n“i—i——”\\n\\nwith a satisfied and expressive countenance, sir ernest observed:\\n\\n“i have nothing more to ask you, mr. cavendish.”\\n\\nthis bit of cross-examination had caused great excitement in court. the\\nheads of the many fashionably attired women present were busily laid\\ntogether, and their whispers became so loud that the judge angrily\\nthreatened to have the court cleared if there was not immediate\\nsilence.\\n\\nthere was little more evidence. the hand-writing experts were called\\nupon for their opinion of the signature of “alfred inglethorp” in the\\nchemist’s poison register. they all declared unanimously that it was\\ncertainly not his hand-writing, and gave it as their view that it might\\nbe that of the prisoner disguised. cross-examined, they admitted that\\nit might be the prisoner’s hand-writing cleverly counterfeited.\\n\\nsir ernest heavywether’s speech in opening the case for the defence was\\nnot a long one, but it was backed by the full force of his emphatic\\nmanner. never, he said, in the course of his long experience, had he\\nknown a charge of murder rest on slighter evidence. not only was it\\nentirely circumstantial, but the greater part of it was practically\\nunproved. let them take the testimony they had heard and sift it\\nimpartially. the strychnine had been found in a drawer in the\\nprisoner’s room. that drawer was an unlocked one, as he had pointed\\nout, and he submitted that there was no evidence to prove that it was\\nthe prisoner who had concealed the poison there. it was, in fact, a\\nwicked and malicious attempt on the part of some third person to fix\\nthe crime on the prisoner. the prosecution had been unable to produce a\\nshred of evidence in support of their contention that it was the\\nprisoner who ordered the black beard from parkson’s. the quarrel which\\nhad taken place between prisoner and his stepmother was freely\\nadmitted, but both it and his financial embarrassments had been grossly\\nexaggerated.\\n\\nhis learned friend—sir ernest nodded carelessly at mr. philips—had\\nstated that if the prisoner were an innocent man, he would have come\\nforward at the inquest to explain that it was he, and not mr.\\ninglethorp, who had been the participator in the quarrel. he thought\\nthe facts had been misrepresented. what had actually occurred was this.\\nthe prisoner, returning to the house on tuesday evening, had been\\nauthoritatively told that there had been a violent quarrel between mr.\\nand mrs. inglethorp. no suspicion had entered the prisoner’s head that\\nanyone could possibly have mistaken his voice for that of mr.\\ninglethorp. he naturally concluded that his stepmother had had two\\nquarrels.\\n\\nthe prosecution averred that on monday, july 16th, the prisoner had\\nentered the chemist’s shop in the village, disguised as mr. inglethorp.\\nthe prisoner, on the contrary, was at that time at a lonely spot called\\nmarston’s spinney, where he had been summoned by an anonymous note,\\ncouched in blackmailing terms, and threatening to reveal certain\\nmatters to his wife unless he complied with its demands. the prisoner\\nhad, accordingly, gone to the appointed spot, and after waiting there\\nvainly for half an hour had returned home. unfortunately, he had met\\nwith no one on the way there or back who could vouch for the truth of\\nhis story, but luckily he had kept the note, and it would be produced\\nas evidence.\\n\\nas for the statement relating to the destruction of the will, the\\nprisoner had formerly practised at the bar, and was perfectly well\\naware that the will made in his favour a year before was automatically\\nrevoked by his stepmother’s remarriage. he would call evidence to show\\nwho did destroy the will, and it was possible that that might open up\\nquite a new view of the case.\\n\\nfinally, he would point out to the jury that there was evidence against\\nother people besides john cavendish. he would direct their attention to\\nthe fact that the evidence against mr. lawrence cavendish was quite as\\nstrong, if not stronger than that against his brother.\\n\\nhe would now call the prisoner.\\n\\njohn acquitted himself well in the witness-box. under sir ernest’s\\nskilful handling, he told his tale credibly and well. the anonymous\\nnote received by him was produced, and handed to the jury to examine.\\nthe readiness with which he admitted his financial difficulties, and\\nthe disagreement with his stepmother, lent value to his denials.\\n\\nat the close of his examination, he paused, and said:\\n\\n“i should like to make one thing clear. i utterly reject and disapprove\\nof sir ernest heavywether’s insinuations against my brother. my\\nbrother, i am convinced, had no more to do with the crime than i have.”\\n\\nsir ernest merely smiled, and noted with a sharp eye that john’s\\nprotest had produced a very favourable impression on the jury.\\n\\nthen the cross-examination began.\\n\\n“i understand you to say that it never entered your head that the\\nwitnesses at the inquest could possibly have mistaken your voice for\\nthat of mr. inglethorp. is not that very surprising?”\\n\\n“no, i don’t think so. i was told there had been a quarrel between my\\nmother and mr. inglethorp, and it never occurred to me that such was\\nnot really the case.”\\n\\n“not when the servant dorcas repeated certain fragments of the\\nconversation—fragments which you must have recognized?”\\n\\n“i did not recognize them.”\\n\\n“your memory must be unusually short!”\\n\\n“no, but we were both angry, and, i think, said more than we meant. i\\npaid very little attention to my mother’s actual words.”\\n\\nmr. philips’ incredulous sniff was a triumph of forensic skill. he\\npassed on to the subject of the note.\\n\\n“you have produced this note very opportunely. tell me, is there\\nnothing familiar about the hand-writing of it?”\\n\\n“not that i know of.”\\n\\n“do you not think that it bears a marked resemblance to your own\\nhand-writing—carelessly disguised?”\\n\\n“no, i do not think so.”\\n\\n“i put it to you that it is your own hand-writing!”\\n\\n“no.”\\n\\n“i put it to you that, anxious to prove an alibi, you conceived the\\nidea of a fictitious and rather incredible appointment, and wrote this\\nnote yourself in order to bear out your statement!”\\n\\n“no.”\\n\\n“is it not a fact that, at the time you claim to have been waiting\\nabout at a solitary and unfrequented spot, you were really in the\\nchemist’s shop in styles st. mary, where you purchased strychnine in\\nthe name of alfred inglethorp?”\\n\\n“no, that is a lie.”\\n\\n“i put it to you that, wearing a suit of mr. inglethorp’s clothes, with\\na black beard trimmed to resemble his, you were there—and signed the\\nregister in his name!”\\n\\n“that is absolutely untrue.”\\n\\n“then i will leave the remarkable similarity of hand-writing between\\nthe note, the register, and your own, to the consideration of the\\njury,” said mr. philips, and sat down with the air of a man who has\\ndone his duty, but who was nevertheless horrified by such deliberate\\nperjury.\\n\\nafter this, as it was growing late, the case was adjourned till monday.\\n\\npoirot, i noticed, was looking profoundly discouraged. he had that\\nlittle frown between the eyes that i knew so well.\\n\\n“what is it, poirot?” i inquired.\\n\\n“ah, _mon ami_, things are going badly, badly.”\\n\\nin spite of myself, my heart gave a leap of relief. evidently there was\\na likelihood of john cavendish being acquitted.\\n\\nwhen we reached the house, my little friend waved aside mary’s offer of\\ntea.\\n\\n“no, i thank you, madame. i will mount to my room.”\\n\\ni followed him. still frowning, he went across to the desk and took out\\na small pack of patience cards. then he drew up a chair to the table,\\nand, to my utter amazement, began solemnly to build card houses!\\n\\nmy jaw dropped involuntarily, and he said at once:\\n\\n“no, _mon ami_, i am not in my second childhood! i steady my nerves,\\nthat is all. this employment requires precision of the fingers. with\\nprecision of the fingers goes precision of the brain. and never have i\\nneeded that more than now!”\\n\\n“what is the trouble?” i asked.\\n\\nwith a great thump on the table, poirot demolished his carefully built\\nup edifice.\\n\\n“it is this, _mon ami!_ that i can build card houses seven stories\\nhigh, but i cannot”—thump—“find”—thump—“ that last link of which i\\nspoke to you.”\\n\\ni could not quite tell what to say, so i held my peace, and he began\\nslowly building up the cards again, speaking in jerks as he did so.\\n\\n“it is done—so! by placing—one card—on another—with\\nmathematical—precision!”\\n\\ni watched the card house rising under his hands, story by story. he\\nnever hesitated or faltered. it was really almost like a conjuring\\ntrick.\\n\\n“what a steady hand you’ve got,” i remarked. “i believe i’ve only seen\\nyour hand shake once.”\\n\\n“on an occasion when i was enraged, without doubt,” observed poirot,\\nwith great placidity.\\n\\n“yes indeed! you were in a towering rage. do you remember? it was when\\nyou discovered that the lock of the despatch-case in mrs. inglethorp’s\\nbedroom had been forced. you stood by the mantelpiece, twiddling the\\nthings on it in your usual fashion, and your hand shook like a leaf! i\\nmust say——”\\n\\nbut i stopped suddenly. for poirot, uttering a hoarse and inarticulate\\ncry, again annihilated his masterpiece of cards, and putting his hands\\nover his eyes swayed backwards and forwards, apparently suffering the\\nkeenest agony.\\n\\n“good heavens, poirot!” i cried. “what is the matter? are you taken\\nill?”\\n\\n“no, no,” he gasped. “it is—it is—that i have an idea!”\\n\\n“oh!” i exclaimed, much relieved. “one of your ‘little ideas’?”\\n\\n“ah, _ma foi_, no!” replied poirot frankly. “this time it is an idea\\ngigantic! stupendous! and you—_you_, my friend, have given it to me!”\\n\\nsuddenly clasping me in his arms, he kissed me warmly on both cheeks,\\nand before i had recovered from my surprise ran headlong from the room.\\n\\nmary cavendish entered at that moment.\\n\\n“what _is_ the matter with monsieur poirot? he rushed past me crying\\nout: ‘a garage! for the love of heaven, direct me to a garage, madame!’\\nand, before i could answer, he had dashed out into the street.”\\n\\ni hurried to the window. true enough, there he was, tearing down the\\nstreet, hatless, and gesticulating as he went. i turned to mary with a\\ngesture of despair.\\n\\n“he’ll be stopped by a policeman in another minute. there he goes,\\nround the corner!”\\n\\nour eyes met, and we stared helplessly at one another.\\n\\n“what can be the matter?”\\n\\ni shook my head.\\n\\n“i don’t know. he was building card houses, when suddenly he said he\\nhad an idea, and rushed off as you saw.”\\n\\n“well,” said mary, “i expect he will be back before dinner.”\\n\\nbut night fell, and poirot had not returned.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xii.\\nthe last link\\n\\n\\npoirot’s abrupt departure had intrigued us all greatly. sunday morning\\nwore away, and still he did not reappear. but about three o’clock a\\nferocious and prolonged hooting outside drove us to the window, to see\\npoirot alighting from a car, accompanied by japp and summerhaye. the\\nlittle man was transformed. he radiated an absurd complacency. he bowed\\nwith exaggerated respect to mary cavendish.\\n\\n“madame, i have your permission to hold a little _réunion_ in the\\n_salon_? it is necessary for everyone to attend.”\\n\\nmary smiled sadly.\\n\\n“you know, monsieur poirot, that you have _carte blanche_ in every\\nway.”\\n\\n“you are too amiable, madame.”\\n\\nstill beaming, poirot marshalled us all into the drawing-room, bringing\\nforward chairs as he did so.\\n\\n“miss howard—here. mademoiselle cynthia. monsieur lawrence. the good\\ndorcas. and annie. _bien!_ we must delay our proceedings a few minutes\\nuntil mr. inglethorp arrives. i have sent him a note.”\\n\\nmiss howard rose immediately from her seat.\\n\\n“if that man comes into the house, i leave it!”\\n\\n“no, no!” poirot went up to her and pleaded in a low voice.\\n\\nfinally miss howard consented to return to her chair. a few minutes\\nlater alfred inglethorp entered the room.\\n\\nthe company once assembled, poirot rose from his seat with the air of a\\npopular lecturer, and bowed politely to his audience.\\n\\n“_messieurs, mesdames_, as you all know, i was called in by monsieur\\njohn cavendish to investigate this case. i at once examined the bedroom\\nof the deceased which, by the advice of the doctors, had been kept\\nlocked, and was consequently exactly as it had been when the tragedy\\noccurred. i found: first, a fragment of green material; second, a stain\\non the carpet near the window, still damp; thirdly, an empty box of\\nbromide powders.\\n\\n“to take the fragment of green material first, i found it caught in the\\nbolt of the communicating door between that room and the adjoining one\\noccupied by mademoiselle cynthia. i handed the fragment over to the\\npolice who did not consider it of much importance. nor did they\\nrecognize it for what it was—a piece torn from a green land armlet.”\\n\\nthere was a little stir of excitement.\\n\\n“now there was only one person at styles who worked on the land—mrs.\\ncavendish. therefore it must have been mrs. cavendish who entered the\\ndeceased’s room through the door communicating with mademoiselle\\ncynthia’s room.”\\n\\n“but that door was bolted on the inside!” i cried.\\n\\n“when i examined the room, yes. but in the first place we have only her\\nword for it, since it was she who tried that particular door and\\nreported it fastened. in the ensuing confusion she would have had ample\\nopportunity to shoot the bolt across. i took an early opportunity of\\nverifying my conjectures. to begin with, the fragment corresponds\\nexactly with a tear in mrs. cavendish’s armlet. also, at the inquest,\\nmrs. cavendish declared that she had heard, from her own room, the fall\\nof the table by the bed. i took an early opportunity of testing that\\nstatement by stationing my friend monsieur hastings in the left wing of\\nthe building, just outside mrs. cavendish’s door. i myself, in company\\nwith the police, went to the deceased’s room, and whilst there i,\\napparently accidentally, knocked over the table in question, but found\\nthat, as i had expected, monsieur hastings had heard no sound at all.\\nthis confirmed my belief that mrs. cavendish was not speaking the truth\\nwhen she declared that she had been dressing in her room at the time of\\nthe tragedy. in fact, i was convinced that, far from having been in her\\nown room, mrs. cavendish was actually in the deceased’s room when the\\nalarm was given.”\\n\\ni shot a quick glance at mary. she was very pale, but smiling.\\n\\n“i proceeded to reason on that assumption. mrs. cavendish is in her\\nmother-in-law’s room. we will say that she is seeking for something and\\nhas not yet found it. suddenly mrs. inglethorp awakens and is seized\\nwith an alarming paroxysm. she flings out her arm, overturning the bed\\ntable, and then pulls desperately at the bell. mrs. cavendish,\\nstartled, drops her candle, scattering the grease on the carpet. she\\npicks it up, and retreats quickly to mademoiselle cynthia’s room,\\nclosing the door behind her. she hurries out into the passage, for the\\nservants must not find her where she is. but it is too late! already\\nfootsteps are echoing along the gallery which connects the two wings.\\nwhat can she do? quick as thought, she hurries back to the young girl’s\\nroom, and starts shaking her awake. the hastily aroused household come\\ntrooping down the passage. they are all busily battering at mrs.\\ninglethorp’s door. it occurs to nobody that mrs. cavendish has not\\narrived with the rest, but—and this is significant—i can find no one\\nwho saw her come from the other wing.” he looked at mary cavendish. “am\\ni right, madame?”\\n\\nshe bowed her head.\\n\\n“quite right, monsieur. you understand that, if i had thought i would\\ndo my husband any good by revealing these facts, i would have done so.\\nbut it did not seem to me to bear upon the question of his guilt or\\ninnocence.”\\n\\n“in a sense, that is correct, madame. but it cleared my mind of many\\nmisconceptions, and left me free to see other facts in their true\\nsignificance.”\\n\\n“the will!” cried lawrence. “then it was you, mary, who destroyed the\\nwill?”\\n\\nshe shook her head, and poirot shook his also.\\n\\n“no,” he said quietly. “there is only one person who could possibly\\nhave destroyed that will—mrs. inglethorp herself!”\\n\\n“impossible!” i exclaimed. “she had only made it out that very\\nafternoon!”\\n\\n“nevertheless, _mon ami_, it was mrs. inglethorp. because, in no other\\nway can you account for the fact that, on one of the hottest days of\\nthe year, mrs. inglethorp ordered a fire to be lighted in her room.”\\n\\ni gave a gasp. what idiots we had been never to think of that fire as\\nbeing incongruous! poirot was continuing:\\n\\n“the temperature on that day, messieurs, was 80 degrees in the shade.\\nyet mrs. inglethorp ordered a fire! why? because she wished to destroy\\nsomething, and could think of no other way. you will remember that, in\\nconsequence of the war economics practiced at styles, no waste paper\\nwas thrown away. there was therefore no means of destroying a thick\\ndocument such as a will. the moment i heard of a fire being lighted in\\nmrs. inglethorp’s room, i leaped to the conclusion that it was to\\ndestroy some important document—possibly a will. so the discovery of\\nthe charred fragment in the grate was no surprise to me. i did not, of\\ncourse, know at the time that the will in question had only been made\\nthis afternoon, and i will admit that, when i learnt that fact, i fell\\ninto a grievous error. i came to the conclusion that mrs. inglethorp’s\\ndetermination to destroy her will arose as a direct consequence of the\\nquarrel she had that afternoon, and that therefore the quarrel took\\nplace after, and not before the making of the will.\\n\\n“here, as we know, i was wrong, and i was forced to abandon that idea.\\ni faced the problem from a new standpoint. now, at four o’clock, dorcas\\noverheard her mistress saying angrily: ‘you need not think that any\\nfear of publicity, or scandal between husband and wife will deter me.”\\ni conjectured, and conjectured rightly, that these words were\\naddressed, not to her husband, but to mr. john cavendish. at five\\no’clock, an hour later, she uses almost the same words, but the\\nstandpoint is different. she admits to dorcas, ‘i don’t know what to\\ndo; scandal between husband and wife is a dreadful thing.’ at four\\no’clock she has been angry, but completely mistress of herself. at five\\no’clock she is in violent distress, and speaks of having had a great\\nshock.\\n\\n“looking at the matter psychologically, i drew one deduction which i\\nwas convinced was correct. the second ‘scandal’ she spoke of was not\\nthe same as the first—and it concerned herself!\\n\\n“let us reconstruct. at four o’clock, mrs. inglethorp quarrels with her\\nson, and threatens to denounce him to his wife—who, by the way,\\noverheard the greater part of the conversation. at four-thirty, mrs.\\ninglethorp, in consequence of a conversation on the validity of wills,\\nmakes a will in favour of her husband, which the two gardeners witness.\\nat five o’clock, dorcas finds her mistress in a state of considerable\\nagitation, with a slip of paper—‘a letter,’ dorcas thinks—in her hand,\\nand it is then that she orders the fire in her room to be lighted.\\npresumably, then, between four-thirty and five o’clock, something has\\noccurred to occasion a complete revolution of feeling, since she is now\\nas anxious to destroy the will, as she was before to make it. what was\\nthat something?\\n\\n“as far as we know, she was quite alone during that half-hour. nobody\\nentered or left that boudoir. what then occasioned this sudden change\\nof sentiment?\\n\\n“one can only guess, but i believe my guess to be correct. mrs.\\ninglethorp had no stamps in her desk. we know this, because later she\\nasked dorcas to bring her some. now in the opposite corner of the room\\nstood her husband’s desk—locked. she was anxious to find some stamps,\\nand, according to my theory, she tried her own keys in the desk. that\\none of them fitted i know. she therefore opened the desk, and in\\nsearching for the stamps she came across something else—that slip of\\npaper which dorcas saw in her hand, and which assuredly was never meant\\nfor mrs. inglethorp’s eyes. on the other hand, mrs. cavendish believed\\nthat the slip of paper to which her mother-in-law clung so tenaciously\\nwas a written proof of her own husband’s infidelity. she demanded it\\nfrom mrs. inglethorp who assured her, quite truly, that it had nothing\\nto do with that matter. mrs. cavendish did not believe her. she thought\\nthat mrs. inglethorp was shielding her stepson. now mrs. cavendish is a\\nvery resolute woman, and, behind her mask of reserve, she was madly\\njealous of her husband. she determined to get hold of that paper at all\\ncosts, and in this resolution chance came to her aid. she happened to\\npick up the key of mrs. inglethorp’s despatch-case, which had been lost\\nthat morning. she knew that her mother-in-law invariably kept all\\nimportant papers in this particular case.\\n\\n“mrs. cavendish, therefore, made her plans as only a woman driven\\ndesperate through jealousy could have done. some time in the evening\\nshe unbolted the door leading into mademoiselle cynthia’s room.\\npossibly she applied oil to the hinges, for i found that it opened\\nquite noiselessly when i tried it. she put off her project until the\\nearly hours of the morning as being safer, since the servants were\\naccustomed to hearing her move about her room at that time. she dressed\\ncompletely in her land kit, and made her way quietly through\\nmademoiselle cynthia’s room into that of mrs. inglethorp.”\\n\\nhe paused a moment, and cynthia interrupted:\\n\\n“but i should have woken up if anyone had come through my room?”\\n\\n“not if you were drugged, mademoiselle.”\\n\\n“drugged?”\\n\\n“_mais, oui!_”\\n\\n“you remember”—he addressed us collectively again—“that through all the\\ntumult and noise next door mademoiselle cynthia slept. that admitted of\\ntwo possibilities. either her sleep was feigned—which i did not\\nbelieve—or her unconsciousness was induced by artificial means.\\n\\n“with this latter idea in my mind, i examined all the coffee-cups most\\ncarefully, remembering that it was mrs. cavendish who had brought\\nmademoiselle cynthia her coffee the night before. i took a sample from\\neach cup, and had them analysed—with no result. i had counted the cups\\ncarefully, in the event of one having been removed. six persons had\\ntaken coffee, and six cups were duly found. i had to confess myself\\nmistaken.\\n\\n“then i discovered that i had been guilty of a very grave oversight.\\ncoffee had been brought in for seven persons, not six, for dr.\\nbauerstein had been there that evening. this changed the face of the\\nwhole affair, for there was now one cup missing. the servants noticed\\nnothing, since annie, the housemaid, who took in the coffee, brought in\\nseven cups, not knowing that mr. inglethorp never drank it, whereas\\ndorcas, who cleared them away the following morning, found six as\\nusual—or strictly speaking she found five, the sixth being the one\\nfound broken in mrs. inglethorp’s room.\\n\\n“i was confident that the missing cup was that of mademoiselle cynthia.\\ni had an additional reason for that belief in the fact that all the\\ncups found contained sugar, which mademoiselle cynthia never took in\\nher coffee. my attention was attracted by the story of annie about some\\n‘salt’ on the tray of cocoa which she took every night to mrs.\\ninglethorp’s room. i accordingly secured a sample of that cocoa, and\\nsent it to be analysed.”\\n\\n“but that had already been done by dr. bauerstein,” said lawrence\\nquickly.\\n\\n“not exactly. the analyst was asked by him to report whether strychnine\\nwas, or was not, present. he did not have it tested, as i did, for a\\nnarcotic.”\\n\\n“for a narcotic?”\\n\\n“yes. here is the analyst’s report. mrs. cavendish administered a safe,\\nbut effectual, narcotic to both mrs. inglethorp and mademoiselle\\ncynthia. and it is possible that she had a _mauvais quart d’heure_ in\\nconsequence! imagine her feelings when her mother-in-law is suddenly\\ntaken ill and dies, and immediately after she hears the word ‘poison’!\\nshe has believed that the sleeping draught she administered was\\nperfectly harmless, but there is no doubt that for one terrible moment\\nshe must have feared that mrs. inglethorp’s death lay at her door. she\\nis seized with panic, and under its influence she hurries downstairs,\\nand quickly drops the coffee-cup and saucer used by mademoiselle\\ncynthia into a large brass vase, where it is discovered later by\\nmonsieur lawrence. the remains of the cocoa she dare not touch. too\\nmany eyes are upon her. guess at her relief when strychnine is\\nmentioned, and she discovers that after all the tragedy is not her\\ndoing.\\n\\n“we are now able to account for the symptoms of strychnine poisoning\\nbeing so long in making their appearance. a narcotic taken with\\nstrychnine will delay the action of the poison for some hours.”\\n\\npoirot paused. mary looked up at him, the colour slowly rising in her\\nface.\\n\\n“all you have said is quite true, monsieur poirot. it was the most\\nawful hour of my life. i shall never forget it. but you are wonderful.\\ni understand now——”\\n\\n“what i meant when i told you that you could safely confess to papa\\npoirot, eh? but you would not trust me.”\\n\\n“i see everything now,” said lawrence. “the drugged cocoa, taken on top\\nof the poisoned coffee, amply accounts for the delay.”\\n\\n“exactly. but was the coffee poisoned, or was it not? we come to a\\nlittle difficulty here, since mrs. inglethorp never drank it.”\\n\\n“what?” the cry of surprise was universal.\\n\\n“no. you will remember my speaking of a stain on the carpet in mrs.\\ninglethorp’s room? there were some peculiar points about that stain. it\\nwas still damp, it exhaled a strong odour of coffee, and imbedded in\\nthe nap of the carpet i found some little splinters of china. what had\\nhappened was plain to me, for not two minutes before i had placed my\\nlittle case on the table near the window, and the table, tilting up,\\nhad deposited it upon the floor on precisely the identical spot. in\\nexactly the same way, mrs. inglethorp had laid down her cup of coffee\\non reaching her room the night before, and the treacherous table had\\nplayed her the same trick.\\n\\n“what happened next is mere guess work on my part, but i should say\\nthat mrs. inglethorp picked up the broken cup and placed it on the\\ntable by the bed. feeling in need of a stimulant of some kind, she\\nheated up her cocoa, and drank it off then and there. now we are faced\\nwith a new problem. we know the cocoa contained no strychnine. the\\ncoffee was never drunk. yet the strychnine must have been administered\\nbetween seven and nine o’clock that evening. what third medium was\\nthere—a medium so suitable for disguising the taste of strychnine that\\nit is extraordinary no one has thought of it?” poirot looked round the\\nroom, and then answered himself impressively. “her medicine!”\\n\\n“do you mean that the murderer introduced the strychnine into her\\ntonic?” i cried.\\n\\n“there was no need to introduce it. it was already there—in the\\nmixture. the strychnine that killed mrs. inglethorp was the identical\\nstrychnine prescribed by dr. wilkins. to make that clear to you, i will\\nread you an extract from a book on dispensing which i found in the\\ndispensary of the red cross hospital at tadminster:\\n\\n“‘the following prescription has become famous in text books:\\n\\n\\n          strychninae sulph. . . . . . 1 gr.\\n\\n          potass bromide . . . . . . . 3vi\\n\\n          aqua ad. . . . . . . . . . . . . 3viii\\n\\n          fiat mistura\\n\\n\\n_this solution deposits in a few hours the greater part of the\\nstrychnine salt as an insoluble bromide in transparent crystals. a lady\\nin england lost her life by taking a similar mixture: the precipitated\\nstrychnine collected at the bottom, and in taking the last dose she\\nswallowed nearly all of it!_\\n\\n“now there was, of course, no bromide in dr. wilkins’ prescription, but\\nyou will remember that i mentioned an empty box of bromide powders. one\\nor two of those powders introduced into the full bottle of medicine\\nwould effectually precipitate the strychnine, as the book describes,\\nand cause it to be taken in the last dose. you will learn later that\\nthe person who usually poured out mrs. inglethorp’s medicine was always\\nextremely careful not to shake the bottle, but to leave the sediment at\\nthe bottom of it undisturbed.\\n\\n“throughout the case, there have been evidences that the tragedy was\\nintended to take place on monday evening. on that day, mrs.\\ninglethorp’s bell wire was neatly cut, and on monday evening\\nmademoiselle cynthia was spending the night with friends, so that mrs.\\ninglethorp would have been quite alone in the right wing, completely\\nshut off from help of any kind, and would have died, in all\\nprobability, before medical aid could have been summoned. but in her\\nhurry to be in time for the village entertainment mrs. inglethorp\\nforgot to take her medicine, and the next day she lunched away from\\nhome, so that the last—and fatal—dose was actually taken twenty-four\\nhours later than had been anticipated by the murderer; and it is owing\\nto that delay that the final proof—the last link of the chain—is now in\\nmy hands.”\\n\\namid breathless excitement, he held out three thin strips of paper.\\n\\n“a letter in the murderer’s own hand-writing, _mes amis!_ had it been a\\nlittle clearer in its terms, it is possible that mrs. inglethorp,\\nwarned in time, would have escaped. as it was, she realized her danger,\\nbut not the manner of it.”\\n\\nin the deathly silence, poirot pieced together the slips of paper and,\\nclearing his throat, read:\\n\\ndearest evelyn:\\n\\n    ‘you will be anxious at hearing nothing. it is all right—only it\\n    will be to-night instead of last night. you understand. there’s a\\n    good time coming once the old woman is dead and out of the way. no\\n    one can possibly bring home the crime to me. that idea of yours\\n    about the bromides was a stroke of genius! but we must be very\\n    circumspect. a false step——’\\n\\n\\n“here, my friends, the letter breaks off. doubtless the writer was\\ninterrupted; but there can be no question as to his identity. we all\\nknow this hand-writing and——”\\n\\na howl that was almost a scream broke the silence.\\n\\n“you devil! how did you get it?”\\n\\na chair was overturned. poirot skipped nimbly aside. a quick movement\\non his part, and his assailant fell with a crash.\\n\\n“_messieurs, mesdames_,” said poirot, with a flourish, “let me\\nintroduce you to the murderer, mr. alfred inglethorp!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xiii.\\npoirot explains\\n\\n\\n“poirot, you old villain,” i said, “i’ve half a mind to strangle you!\\nwhat do you mean by deceiving me as you have done?”\\n\\nwe were sitting in the library. several hectic days lay behind us. in\\nthe room below, john and mary were together once more, while alfred\\ninglethorp and miss howard were in custody. now at last, i had poirot\\nto myself, and could relieve my still burning curiosity.\\n\\npoirot did not answer me for a moment, but at last he said:\\n\\n“i did not deceive you, _mon ami_. at most, i permitted you to deceive\\nyourself.”\\n\\n“yes, but why?”\\n\\n“well, it is difficult to explain. you see, my friend, you have a\\nnature so honest, and a countenance so transparent, that—_enfin_, to\\nconceal your feelings is impossible! if i had told you my ideas, the\\nvery first time you saw mr. alfred inglethorp that astute gentleman\\nwould have—in your so expressive idiom—‘smelt a rat’! and then,\\n_bonjour_ to our chances of catching him!”\\n\\n“i think that i have more diplomacy than you give me credit for.”\\n\\n“my friend,” besought poirot, “i implore you, do not enrage yourself!\\nyour help has been of the most invaluable. it is but the extremely\\nbeautiful nature that you have, which made me pause.”\\n\\n“well,” i grumbled, a little mollified. “i still think you might have\\ngiven me a hint.”\\n\\n“but i did, my friend. several hints. you would not take them. think\\nnow, did i ever say to you that i believed john cavendish guilty? did i\\nnot, on the contrary, tell you that he would almost certainly be\\nacquitted?”\\n\\n“yes, but——”\\n\\n“and did i not immediately afterwards speak of the difficulty of\\nbringing the murderer to justice? was it not plain to you that i was\\nspeaking of two entirely different persons?”\\n\\n“no,” i said, “it was not plain to me!”\\n\\n“then again,” continued poirot, “at the beginning, did i not repeat to\\nyou several times that i didn’t want mr. inglethorp arrested _now_?\\nthat should have conveyed something to you.”\\n\\n“do you mean to say you suspected him as long ago as that?”\\n\\n“yes. to begin with, whoever else might benefit by mrs. inglethorp’s\\ndeath, her husband would benefit the most. there was no getting away\\nfrom that. when i went up to styles with you that first day, i had no\\nidea as to how the crime had been committed, but from what i knew of\\nmr. inglethorp i fancied that it would be very hard to find anything to\\nconnect him with it. when i arrived at the château, i realized at once\\nthat it was mrs. inglethorp who had burnt the will; and there, by the\\nway, you cannot complain, my friend, for i tried my best to force on\\nyou the significance of that bedroom fire in midsummer.”\\n\\n“yes, yes,” i said impatiently. “go on.”\\n\\n“well, my friend, as i say, my views as to mr. inglethorp’s guilt were\\nvery much shaken. there was, in fact, so much evidence against him that\\ni was inclined to believe that he had not done it.”\\n\\n“when did you change your mind?”\\n\\n“when i found that the more efforts i made to clear him, the more\\nefforts he made to get himself arrested. then, when i discovered that\\ninglethorp had nothing to do with mrs. raikes and that in fact it was\\njohn cavendish who was interested in that quarter, i was quite sure.”\\n\\n“but why?”\\n\\n“simply this. if it had been inglethorp who was carrying on an intrigue\\nwith mrs. raikes, his silence was perfectly comprehensible. but, when i\\ndiscovered that it was known all over the village that it was john who\\nwas attracted by the farmer’s pretty wife, his silence bore quite a\\ndifferent interpretation. it was nonsense to pretend that he was afraid\\nof the scandal, as no possible scandal could attach to him. this\\nattitude of his gave me furiously to think, and i was slowly forced to\\nthe conclusion that alfred inglethorp wanted to be arrested. _eh bien!_\\nfrom that moment, i was equally determined that he should not be\\narrested.”\\n\\n“wait a minute. i don’t see why he wished to be arrested?”\\n\\n“because, _mon ami_, it is the law of your country that a man once\\nacquitted can never be tried again for the same offence. aha! but it\\nwas clever—his idea! assuredly, he is a man of method. see here, he\\nknew that in his position he was bound to be suspected, so he conceived\\nthe exceedingly clever idea of preparing a lot of manufactured evidence\\nagainst himself. he wished to be arrested. he would then produce his\\nirreproachable alibi—and, hey presto, he was safe for life!”\\n\\n“but i still don’t see how he managed to prove his alibi, and yet go to\\nthe chemist’s shop?”\\n\\npoirot stared at me in surprise.\\n\\n“is it possible? my poor friend! you have not yet realized that it was\\nmiss howard who went to the chemist’s shop?”\\n\\n“miss howard?”\\n\\n“but, certainly. who else? it was most easy for her. she is of a good\\nheight, her voice is deep and manly; moreover, remember, she and\\ninglethorp are cousins, and there is a distinct resemblance between\\nthem, especially in their gait and bearing. it was simplicity itself.\\nthey are a clever pair!”\\n\\n“i am still a little fogged as to how exactly the bromide business was\\ndone,” i remarked.\\n\\n“_bon!_ i will reconstruct for you as far as possible. i am inclined to\\nthink that miss howard was the master mind in that affair. you remember\\nher once mentioning that her father was a doctor? possibly she\\ndispensed his medicines for him, or she may have taken the idea from\\none of the many books lying about when mademoiselle cynthia was\\nstudying for her exam. anyway, she was familiar with the fact that the\\naddition of a bromide to a mixture containing strychnine would cause\\nthe precipitation of the latter. probably the idea came to her quite\\nsuddenly. mrs. inglethorp had a box of bromide powders, which she\\noccasionally took at night. what could be easier than quietly to\\ndissolve one or more of those powders in mrs. inglethorp’s large sized\\nbottle of medicine when it came from coot’s? the risk is practically\\nnil. the tragedy will not take place until nearly a fortnight later. if\\nanyone has seen either of them touching the medicine, they will have\\nforgotten it by that time. miss howard will have engineered her\\nquarrel, and departed from the house. the lapse of time, and her\\nabsence, will defeat all suspicion. yes, it was a clever idea! if they\\nhad left it alone, it is possible the crime might never have been\\nbrought home to them. but they were not satisfied. they tried to be too\\nclever—and that was their undoing.”\\n\\npoirot puffed at his tiny cigarette, his eyes fixed on the ceiling.\\n\\n“they arranged a plan to throw suspicion on john cavendish, by buying\\nstrychnine at the village chemist’s, and signing the register in his\\nhand-writing.\\n\\n“on monday mrs. inglethorp will take the last dose of her medicine. on\\nmonday, therefore, at six o’clock, alfred inglethorp arranges to be\\nseen by a number of people at a spot far removed from the village. miss\\nhoward has previously made up a cock and bull story about him and mrs.\\nraikes to account for his holding his tongue afterwards. at six\\no’clock, miss howard, disguised as alfred inglethorp, enters the\\nchemist’s shop, with her story about a dog, obtains the strychnine, and\\nwrites the name of alfred inglethorp in john’s handwriting, which she\\nhad previously studied carefully.\\n\\n“but, as it will never do if john, too, can prove an alibi, she writes\\nhim an anonymous note—still copying his hand-writing—which takes him to\\na remote spot where it is exceedingly unlikely that anyone will see\\nhim.\\n\\n“so far, all goes well. miss howard goes back to middlingham. alfred\\ninglethorp returns to styles. there is nothing that can compromise him\\nin any way, since it is miss howard who has the strychnine, which,\\nafter all, is only wanted as a blind to throw suspicion on john\\ncavendish.\\n\\n“but now a hitch occurs. mrs. inglethorp does not take her medicine\\nthat night. the broken bell, cynthia’s absence—arranged by inglethorp\\nthrough his wife—all these are wasted. and then—he makes his slip.\\n\\n“mrs. inglethorp is out, and he sits down to write to his accomplice,\\nwho, he fears, may be in a panic at the non-success of their plan. it\\nis probable that mrs. inglethorp returned earlier than he expected.\\ncaught in the act, and somewhat flurried he hastily shuts and locks his\\ndesk. he fears that if he remains in the room he may have to open it\\nagain, and that mrs. inglethorp might catch sight of the letter before\\nhe could snatch it up. so he goes out and walks in the woods, little\\ndreaming that mrs. inglethorp will open his desk, and discover the\\nincriminating document.\\n\\n“but this, as we know, is what happened. mrs. inglethorp reads it, and\\nbecomes aware of the perfidy of her husband and evelyn howard, though,\\nunfortunately, the sentence about the bromides conveys no warning to\\nher mind. she knows that she is in danger—but is ignorant of where the\\ndanger lies. she decides to say nothing to her husband, but sits down\\nand writes to her solicitor, asking him to come on the morrow, and she\\nalso determines to destroy immediately the will which she has just\\nmade. she keeps the fatal letter.”\\n\\n“it was to discover that letter, then, that her husband forced the lock\\nof the despatch-case?”\\n\\n“yes, and from the enormous risk he ran we can see how fully he\\nrealized its importance. that letter excepted, there was absolutely\\nnothing to connect him with the crime.”\\n\\n“there’s only one thing i can’t make out, why didn’t he destroy it at\\nonce when he got hold of it?”\\n\\n“because he did not dare take the biggest risk of all—that of keeping\\nit on his own person.”\\n\\n“i don’t understand.”\\n\\n“look at it from his point of view. i have discovered that there were\\nonly five short minutes in which he could have taken it—the five\\nminutes immediately before our own arrival on the scene, for before\\nthat time annie was brushing the stairs, and would have seen anyone who\\npassed going to the right wing. figure to yourself the scene! he enters\\nthe room, unlocking the door by means of one of the other doorkeys—they\\nwere all much alike. he hurries to the despatch-case—it is locked, and\\nthe keys are nowhere to be seen. that is a terrible blow to him, for it\\nmeans that his presence in the room cannot be concealed as he had\\nhoped. but he sees clearly that everything must be risked for the sake\\nof that damning piece of evidence. quickly, he forces the lock with a\\npenknife, and turns over the papers until he finds what he is looking\\nfor.\\n\\n“but now a fresh dilemma arises: he dare not keep that piece of paper\\non him. he may be seen leaving the room—he may be searched. if the\\npaper is found on him, it is certain doom. probably, at this minute,\\ntoo, he hears the sounds below of mr. wells and john leaving the\\nboudoir. he must act quickly. where can he hide this terrible slip of\\npaper? the contents of the waste-paper-basket are kept and in any case,\\nare sure to be examined. there are no means of destroying it; and he\\ndare not keep it. he looks round, and he sees—what do you think, _mon\\nami?_”\\n\\ni shook my head.\\n\\n“in a moment, he has torn the letter into long thin strips, and rolling\\nthem up into spills he thrusts them hurriedly in amongst the other\\nspills in the vase on the mantle-piece.”\\n\\ni uttered an exclamation.\\n\\n“no one would think of looking there,” poirot continued. “and he will\\nbe able, at his leisure, to come back and destroy this solitary piece\\nof evidence against him.”\\n\\n“then, all the time, it was in the spill vase in mrs. inglethorp’s\\nbedroom, under our very noses?” i cried.\\n\\npoirot nodded.\\n\\n“yes, my friend. that is where i discovered my ‘last link,’ and i owe\\nthat very fortunate discovery to you.”\\n\\n“to me?”\\n\\n“yes. do you remember telling me that my hand shook as i was\\nstraightening the ornaments on the mantelpiece?”\\n\\n“yes, but i don’t see——”\\n\\n“no, but i saw. do you know, my friend, i remembered that earlier in\\nthe morning, when we had been there together, i had straightened all\\nthe objects on the mantelpiece. and, if they were already straightened,\\nthere would be no need to straighten them again, unless, in the\\nmeantime, someone else had touched them.”\\n\\n“dear me,” i murmured, “so that is the explanation of your\\nextraordinary behaviour. you rushed down to styles, and found it still\\nthere?”\\n\\n“yes, and it was a race for time.”\\n\\n“but i still can’t understand why inglethorp was such a fool as to\\nleave it there when he had plenty of opportunity to destroy it.”\\n\\n“ah, but he had no opportunity. _i_ saw to that.”\\n\\n“you?”\\n\\n“yes. do you remember reproving me for taking the household into my\\nconfidence on the subject?”\\n\\n“yes.”\\n\\n“well, my friend, i saw there was just one chance. i was not sure then\\nif inglethorp was the criminal or not, but if he was i reasoned that he\\nwould not have the paper on him, but would have hidden it somewhere,\\nand by enlisting the sympathy of the household i could effectually\\nprevent his destroying it. he was already under suspicion, and by\\nmaking the matter public i secured the services of about ten amateur\\ndetectives, who would be watching him unceasingly, and being himself\\naware of their watchfulness he would not dare seek further to destroy\\nthe document. he was therefore forced to depart from the house, leaving\\nit in the spill vase.”\\n\\n“but surely miss howard had ample opportunities of aiding him.”\\n\\n“yes, but miss howard did not know of the paper’s existence. in\\naccordance with their prearranged plan, she never spoke to alfred\\ninglethorp. they were supposed to be deadly enemies, and until john\\ncavendish was safely convicted they neither of them dared risk a\\nmeeting. of course i had a watch kept on mr. inglethorp, hoping that\\nsooner or later he would lead me to the hiding-place. but he was too\\nclever to take any chances. the paper was safe where it was; since no\\none had thought of looking there in the first week, it was not likely\\nthey would do so afterwards. but for your lucky remark, we might never\\nhave been able to bring him to justice.”\\n\\n“i understand that now; but when did you first begin to suspect miss\\nhoward?”\\n\\n“when i discovered that she had told a lie at the inquest about the\\nletter she had received from mrs. inglethorp.”\\n\\n“why, what was there to lie about?”\\n\\n“you saw that letter? do you recall its general appearance?”\\n\\n“yes—more or less.”\\n\\n“you will recollect, then, that mrs. inglethorp wrote a very\\ndistinctive hand, and left large clear spaces between her words. but if\\nyou look at the date at the top of the letter you will notice that\\n‘july 17th’ is quite different in this respect. do you see what i\\nmean?”\\n\\n“no,” i confessed, “i don’t.”\\n\\n“you do not see that that letter was not written on the 17th, but on\\nthe 7th—the day after miss howard’s departure? the ‘1’ was written in\\nbefore the ‘7’ to turn it into the ‘17th’.”\\n\\n“but why?”\\n\\n“that is exactly what i asked myself. why does miss howard suppress the\\nletter written on the 17th, and produce this faked one instead? because\\nshe did not wish to show the letter of the 17th. why, again? and at\\nonce a suspicion dawned in my mind. you will remember my saying that it\\nwas wise to beware of people who were not telling you the truth.”\\n\\n“and yet,” i cried indignantly, “after that, you gave me two reasons\\nwhy miss howard could not have committed the crime!”\\n\\n“and very good reasons too,” replied poirot. “for a long time they were\\na stumbling-block to me until i remembered a very significant fact:\\nthat she and alfred inglethorp were cousins. she could not have\\ncommitted the crime single-handed, but the reasons against that did not\\ndebar her from being an accomplice. and, then, there was that rather\\nover-vehement hatred of hers! it concealed a very opposite emotion.\\nthere was, undoubtedly, a tie of passion between them long before he\\ncame to styles. they had already arranged their infamous plot—that he\\nshould marry this rich, but rather foolish old lady, induce her to make\\na will leaving her money to him, and then gain their ends by a very\\ncleverly conceived crime. if all had gone as they planned, they would\\nprobably have left england, and lived together on their poor victim’s\\nmoney.\\n\\n“they are a very astute and unscrupulous pair. while suspicion was to\\nbe directed against him, she would be making quiet preparations for a\\nvery different _dénouement_. she arrives from middlingham with all the\\ncompromising items in her possession. no suspicion attaches to her. no\\nnotice is paid to her coming and going in the house. she hides the\\nstrychnine and glasses in john’s room. she puts the beard in the attic.\\nshe will see to it that sooner or later they are duly discovered.”\\n\\n“i don’t quite see why they tried to fix the blame on john,” i\\nremarked. “it would have been much easier for them to bring the crime\\nhome to lawrence.”\\n\\n“yes, but that was mere chance. all the evidence against him arose out\\nof pure accident. it must, in fact, have been distinctly annoying to\\nthe pair of schemers.”\\n\\n“his manner was unfortunate,” i observed thoughtfully.\\n\\n“yes. you realize, of course, what was at the back of that?”\\n\\n“no.”\\n\\n“you did not understand that he believed mademoiselle cynthia guilty of\\nthe crime?”\\n\\n“no,” i exclaimed, astonished. “impossible!”\\n\\n“not at all. i myself nearly had the same idea. it was in my mind when\\ni asked mr. wells that first question about the will. then there were\\nthe bromide powders which she had made up, and her clever male\\nimpersonations, as dorcas recounted them to us. there was really more\\nevidence against her than anyone else.”\\n\\n“you are joking, poirot!”\\n\\n“no. shall i tell you what made monsieur lawrence turn so pale when he\\nfirst entered his mother’s room on the fatal night? it was because,\\nwhilst his mother lay there, obviously poisoned, he saw, over your\\nshoulder, that the door into mademoiselle cynthia’s room was unbolted.”\\n\\n“but he declared that he saw it bolted!” i cried.\\n\\n“exactly,” said poirot dryly. “and that was just what confirmed my\\nsuspicion that it was not. he was shielding mademoiselle cynthia.”\\n\\n“but why should he shield her?”\\n\\n“because he is in love with her.”\\n\\ni laughed.\\n\\n“there, poirot, you are quite wrong! i happen to know for a fact that,\\nfar from being in love with her, he positively dislikes her.”\\n\\n“who told you that, _mon ami?_”\\n\\n“cynthia herself.”\\n\\n“_la pauvre petite!_ and she was concerned?”\\n\\n“she said that she did not mind at all.”\\n\\n“then she certainly did mind very much,” remarked poirot. “they are\\nlike that—_les femmes!_”\\n\\n“what you say about lawrence is a great surprise to me,” i said.\\n\\n“but why? it was most obvious. did not monsieur lawrence make the sour\\nface every time mademoiselle cynthia spoke and laughed with his\\nbrother? he had taken it into his long head that mademoiselle cynthia\\nwas in love with monsieur john. when he entered his mother’s room, and\\nsaw her obviously poisoned, he jumped to the conclusion that\\nmademoiselle cynthia knew something about the matter. he was nearly\\ndriven desperate. first he crushed the coffee-cup to powder under his\\nfeet, remembering that _she_ had gone up with his mother the night\\nbefore, and he determined that there should be no chance of testing its\\ncontents. thenceforward, he strenuously, and quite uselessly, upheld\\nthe theory of ‘death from natural causes’.”\\n\\n“and what about the ‘extra coffee-cup’?”\\n\\n“i was fairly certain that it was mrs. cavendish who had hidden it, but\\ni had to make sure. monsieur lawrence did not know at all what i meant;\\nbut, on reflection, he came to the conclusion that if he could find an\\nextra coffee-cup anywhere his lady love would be cleared of suspicion.\\nand he was perfectly right.”\\n\\n“one thing more. what did mrs. inglethorp mean by her dying words?”\\n\\n“they were, of course, an accusation against her husband.”\\n\\n“dear me, poirot,” i said with a sigh, “i think you have explained\\neverything. i am glad it has all ended so happily. even john and his\\nwife are reconciled.”\\n\\n“thanks to me.”\\n\\n“how do you mean—thanks to you?”\\n\\n“my dear friend, do you not realize that it was simply and solely the\\ntrial which has brought them together again? that john cavendish still\\nloved his wife, i was convinced. also, that she was equally in love\\nwith him. but they had drifted very far apart. it all arose from a\\nmisunderstanding. she married him without love. he knew it. he is a\\nsensitive man in his way, he would not force himself upon her if she\\ndid not want him. and, as he withdrew, her love awoke. but they are\\nboth unusually proud, and their pride held them inexorably apart. he\\ndrifted into an entanglement with mrs. raikes, and she deliberately\\ncultivated the friendship of dr. bauerstein. do you remember the day of\\njohn cavendish’s arrest, when you found me deliberating over a big\\ndecision?”\\n\\n“yes, i quite understood your distress.”\\n\\n“pardon me, _mon ami_, but you did not understand it in the least. i\\nwas trying to decide whether or not i would clear john cavendish at\\nonce. i could have cleared him—though it might have meant a failure to\\nconvict the real criminals. they were entirely in the dark as to my\\nreal attitude up to the very last moment—which partly accounts for my\\nsuccess.”\\n\\n“do you mean that you could have saved john cavendish from being\\nbrought to trial?”\\n\\n“yes, my friend. but i eventually decided in favour of ‘a woman’s\\nhappiness’. nothing but the great danger through which they have passed\\ncould have brought these two proud souls together again.”\\n\\ni looked at poirot in silent amazement. the colossal cheek of the\\nlittle man! who on earth but poirot would have thought of a trial for\\nmurder as a restorer of conjugal happiness!\\n\\n“i perceive your thoughts, _mon ami_,” said poirot, smiling at me. “no\\none but hercule poirot would have attempted such a thing! and you are\\nwrong in condemning it. the happiness of one man and one woman is the\\ngreatest thing in all the world.”\\n\\nhis words took me back to earlier events. i remembered mary as she lay\\nwhite and exhausted on the sofa, listening, listening. there had come\\nthe sound of the bell below. she had started up. poirot had opened the\\ndoor, and meeting her agonized eyes had nodded gently. “yes, madame,”\\nhe said. “i have brought him back to you.” he had stood aside, and as i\\nwent out i had seen the look in mary’s eyes, as john cavendish had\\ncaught his wife in his arms.\\n\\n“perhaps you are right, poirot,” i said gently. “yes, it is the\\ngreatest thing in the world.”\\n\\nsuddenly, there was a tap at the door, and cynthia peeped in.\\n\\n“i—i only——”\\n\\n“come in,” i said, springing up.\\n\\nshe came in, but did not sit down.\\n\\n“i—only wanted to tell you something——”\\n\\n“yes?”\\n\\ncynthia fidgeted with a little tassel for some moments, then, suddenly\\nexclaiming: “you dears!” kissed first me and then poirot, and rushed\\nout of the room again.\\n\\n“what on earth does this mean?” i asked, surprised.\\n\\nit was very nice to be kissed by cynthia, but the publicity of the\\nsalute rather impaired the pleasure.\\n\\n“it means that she has discovered monsieur lawrence does not dislike\\nher as much as she thought,” replied poirot philosophically.\\n\\n“but——”\\n\\n“here he is.”\\n\\nlawrence at that moment passed the door.\\n\\n“eh! monsieur lawrence,” called poirot. “we must congratulate you, is\\nit not so?”\\n\\nlawrence blushed, and then smiled awkwardly. a man in love is a sorry\\nspectacle. now cynthia had looked charming.\\n\\ni sighed.\\n\\n“what is it, _mon ami?_”\\n\\n“nothing,” i said sadly. “they are two delightful women!”\\n\\n“and neither of them is for you?” finished poirot. “never mind. console\\nyourself, my friend. we may hunt together again, who knows? and then——”\\n\\n\\nthe end\\n\\n  poirot investigates\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  by the same author\\n\\n  the

i\\n\\n\\n  the adventure of “the western star”\\n\\ni was standing at the window of poirot’s rooms looking out idly on\\nthe street below.\\n\\n“that’s queer,” i ejaculated suddenly beneath my breath.\\n\\n“what is, _mon ami_?” asked poirot placidly, from the depths of\\nhis comfortable chair.\\n\\n“deduce, poirot, from the following facts! here is a young lady,\\nrichly dressed—fashionable hat, magnificent furs. she is coming\\nalong slowly, looking up at the houses as she goes. unknown to her,\\nshe is being shadowed by three men and a middle-aged woman. they\\nhave just been joined by an errand boy who points after the girl,\\ngesticulating as he does so. what drama is this being played? is\\nthe girl a crook, and are the shadowers detectives preparing to\\narrest her? or are _they_ the scoundrels, and are they plotting to\\nattack an innocent victim? what does the great detective say?”\\n\\n“the great detective, _mon ami_, chooses, as ever, the simplest\\ncourse. he rises to see for himself.” and my friend joined me at\\nthe window.\\n\\nin a minute he gave vent to an amused chuckle.\\n\\n“as usual, your facts are tinged with your incurable romanticism.\\nthat is miss mary marvell, the film star. she is being followed by\\na bevy of admirers who have recognized her. and, _en passant_, my\\ndear hastings, she is quite aware of the fact!”\\n\\ni laughed.\\n\\n“so all is explained! but you get no marks for that, poirot. it\\nwas a mere matter of recognition.”\\n\\n“_en vérité!_ and how many times have you seen mary marvell on the\\nscreen, _mon cher_?”\\n\\ni thought.\\n\\n“about a dozen times perhaps.”\\n\\n“and i—once! yet _i_ recognize her, and _you_ do not.”\\n\\n“she looks so different,” i replied rather feebly.\\n\\n“ah! _sacré_!” cried poirot. “is it that you expect her to promenade\\nherself in the streets of london in a cowboy hat, or with bare\\nfeet, and a bunch of curls, as an irish colleen? always with you\\nit is the non-essentials! remember the case of the dancer, valerie\\nsaintclair.”\\n\\ni shrugged my shoulders, slightly annoyed.\\n\\n“but console yourself, _mon ami_,” said poirot, calming down. “all\\ncannot be as hercule poirot! i know it well.”\\n\\n“you really have the best opinion of yourself of anyone i ever\\nknew!” i cried, divided between amusement and annoyance.\\n\\n“what will you? when one is unique, one knows it! and others share\\nthat opinion—even, if i mistake not, miss mary marvell.”\\n\\n“what?”\\n\\n“without doubt. she is coming here.”\\n\\n“how do you make that out?”\\n\\n“very simply. this street, it is not aristocratic, _mon ami_! in\\nit there is no fashionable doctor, no fashionable dentist—still\\nless is there a fashionable milliner! but there _is_ a fashionable\\ndetective. _oui_, my friend, it is true—i am become the mode, the\\n_dernier cri_! one says to another: ‘_comment?_ you have lost your\\ngold pencil-case? you must go to the little belgian. he is too\\nmarvellous! every one goes! _courez!’_ and they arrive! in flocks,\\n_mon ami_! with problems of the most foolish!” a bell rang below.\\n“what did i tell you? that is miss marvell.”\\n\\nas usual, poirot was right. after a short interval, the american\\nfilm star was ushered in, and we rose to our feet.\\n\\nmary marvell was undoubtedly one of the most popular actresses on\\nthe screen. she had only lately arrived in england in company with\\nher husband, gregory b. rolf, also a film actor. their marriage\\nhad taken place about a year ago in the states and this was their\\nfirst visit to england. they had been given a great reception.\\nevery one was prepared to go mad over mary marvell, her wonderful\\nclothes, her furs, her jewels, above all one jewel, the great\\ndiamond which had been nicknamed, to match its owner, “the western\\nstar.” much, true and untrue, had been written about this famous\\nstone which was reported to be insured for the enormous sum of\\nfifty thousand pounds.\\n\\nall these details passed rapidly through my mind as i joined with\\npoirot in greeting our fair client.\\n\\nmiss marvell was small and slender, very fair and girlish-looking,\\nwith the wide innocent blue eyes of a child.\\n\\npoirot drew forward a chair for her, and she commenced talking at\\nonce.\\n\\n“you will probably think me very foolish, monsieur poirot, but lord\\ncronshaw was telling me last night how wonderfully you cleared up\\nthe mystery of his nephew’s death, and i felt that i just must have\\nyour advice. i dare say it’s only a silly hoax—gregory says so—but\\nit’s just worrying me to death.”\\n\\nshe paused for breath. poirot beamed encouragement.\\n\\n“proceed, madame. you comprehend, i am still in the dark.”\\n\\n“it’s these letters.” miss marvell unclasped her handbag, and drew\\nout three envelopes which she handed to poirot.\\n\\nthe latter scrutinized them closely.\\n\\n“cheap paper—the name and address carefully printed. let us see\\nthe inside.” he drew out the enclosure.\\n\\ni had joined him, and was leaning over his shoulder. the writing\\nconsisted of a single sentence, carefully printed like the envelope.\\nit ran as follows:\\n\\n“the great diamond which is the left eye of the god must return\\nwhence it came.”\\n\\nthe second letter was couched in precisely the same terms, but the\\nthird was more explicit:\\n\\n“you have been warned. you have not obeyed. now the diamond will\\nbe taken from you. at the full of the moon, the two diamonds which\\nare the left and right eye of the god shall return. so it is\\nwritten.”\\n\\n“the first letter i treated as a joke,” explained miss marvell.\\n“when i got the second, i began to wonder. the third one came\\nyesterday, and it seemed to me that, after all, the matter might\\nbe more serious than i had imagined.”\\n\\n“i see they did not come by post, these letters.”\\n\\n“no; they were left by hand—by a _chinaman._ that is what frightens\\nme.”\\n\\n“why?”\\n\\n“because it was from a chink in san francisco that gregory bought\\nthe stone three years ago.”\\n\\n“i see, madame, that you believe the diamond referred to to be——”\\n\\n“‘the western star,’” finished miss marvell. “that’s so. at the\\ntime, gregory remembers that there was some story attached to the\\nstone, but the chink wasn’t handing out any information. gregory\\nsays he seemed just scared to death, and in a mortal hurry to get\\nrid of the thing. he only asked about a tenth of its value. it was\\ngreg’s wedding present to me.”\\n\\npoirot nodded thoughtfully.\\n\\n“the story seems of an almost unbelievable romanticism. and yet—who\\nknows? i pray of you, hastings, hand me my little almanac.”\\n\\ni complied.\\n\\n“_voyons!_” said poirot, turning the leaves.\\n\\n“when is the date of the full moon? ah, friday next. that is in\\nthree days’ time. _eh bien_, madame, you seek my advice—i give it\\nto you. this _belle histoire_ may be a hoax—but it may not!\\ntherefore i counsel you to place the diamond in my keeping until\\nafter friday next. then we can take what steps we please.”\\n\\na slight cloud passed over the actress’s face, and she replied\\nconstrainedly:\\n\\n“i’m afraid that’s impossible.”\\n\\n“you have it with you—_hein_?” poirot was watching her narrowly.\\n\\nthe girl hesitated a moment, then slipped her hand into the bosom\\nof her gown, drawing out a long thin chain. she leaned forward,\\nunclosing her hand. in the palm, a stone of white fire, exquisitely\\nset in platinum, lay and winked at us solemnly.\\n\\npoirot drew in his breath with a long hiss.\\n\\n“_épatant!_” he murmured. “you permit, madame?” he took the jewel\\nin his own hand and scrutinized it keenly, then restored it to her\\nwith a little bow. “a magnificent stone—without a flaw. ah, _cent\\ntonnerres!_ and you carry it about with you, _comme ça_!”\\n\\n“no, no, i’m very careful really, monsieur poirot. as a rule it’s\\nlocked up in my jewel-case, and left in the hotel safe deposit.\\nwe’re staying at the _magnificent_, you know. i just brought it\\nalong to-day for you to see.”\\n\\n“and you will leave it with me, _n’est-ce pas_? you will be advised\\nby papa poirot?”\\n\\n“well, you see, it’s this way, monsieur poirot. on friday we’re\\ngoing down to yardly chase to spend a few days with lord and lady\\nyardly.”\\n\\nher words awoke a vague echo of remembrance in my mind. some\\ngossip—what was it now? a few years ago lord and lady yardly had\\npaid a visit to the states, rumour had it that his lordship had\\nrather gone the pace out there with the assistance of some lady\\nfriends—but surely there was something more, some gossip which\\ncoupled lady yardly’s name with that of a “movie” star in\\ncalifornia—why! it came to me in a flash—of course it was none\\nother than gregory b. rolf.\\n\\n“i’ll let you into a little secret, monsieur poirot,” miss marvell\\nwas continuing. “we’ve got a deal on with lord yardly. there’s some\\nchance of our arranging to film a play down there in his ancestral\\npile.”\\n\\n“at yardly chase?” i cried, interested. “why, it’s one of the show\\nplaces of england.”\\n\\nmiss marvell nodded.\\n\\n“i guess it’s the real old feudal stuff all right. but he wants a\\npretty stiff price, and of course i don’t know yet whether the deal\\nwill go through, but greg and i always like to combine business\\nwith pleasure.”\\n\\n“but—i demand pardon if i am dense, madame—surely it is possible\\nto visit yardly chase without taking the diamond with you?”\\n\\na shrewd, hard look came into miss marvell’s eyes which belied\\ntheir childlike appearance. she looked suddenly a good deal older.\\n\\n“i want to wear it down there.”\\n\\n“surely” i said suddenly, “there are some very famous jewels in\\nthe yardly collection, a large diamond amongst them?”\\n\\n“that’s so,” said miss marvell briefly.\\n\\ni heard poirot murmur beneath his breath: “ah, _c’est comme ça_!”\\nthen he said aloud, with his usual uncanny luck in hitting the\\nbull’s-eye (he dignifies it by the name of psychology): “then you\\nare without doubt already acquainted with lady yardly, or perhaps\\nyour husband is?”\\n\\n“gregory knew her when she was out west three years ago,” said miss\\nmarvell. she hesitated a moment, and then added abruptly: “do\\neither of you ever see _society gossip_?”\\n\\nwe both pleaded guilty rather shamefacedly.\\n\\n“i ask because in this week’s number there is an article on famous\\njewels, and it’s really very curious——” she broke off.\\n\\ni rose, went to the table at the other side of the room and returned\\nwith the paper in question in my hand. she took it from me, found\\nthe article, and began to read aloud:\\n\\n“. . . amongst other famous stones may be included the star of the\\neast, a diamond in the possession of the yardly family. an ancestor\\nof the present lord yardly brought it back with him from china,\\nand a romantic story is said to attach to it. according to this,\\nthe stone was once the right eye of a temple god. another diamond,\\nexactly similar in form and size, formed the left eye, and the\\nstory goes that this jewel, too, would in course of time be stolen.\\n‘one eye shall go west, the other east, till they shall meet once\\nmore. then, in triumph shall they return to the god.’ it is a\\ncurious coincidence that there is at the present time a stone\\ncorresponding closely in description with this one, and known as\\n‘the star of the west,’ or ‘the western star.’ it is the property\\nof the celebrated film actress, miss mary marvell. a comparison of\\nthe two stones would be interesting.”\\n\\nshe stopped.\\n\\n“_épatant!_” murmured poirot. “without doubt a romance of the first\\nwater.” he turned to mary marvell. “and you are not afraid, madame?\\nyou have no superstitious terrors? you do not fear to introduce\\nthese two siamese twins to each other lest a chinaman should appear\\nand, hey presto! whisk them both back to china?”\\n\\nhis tone was mocking, but i fancied that an undercurrent of\\nseriousness lay beneath it.\\n\\n“i don’t believe that lady yardly’s diamond is anything like as\\ngood a stone as mine,” said miss marvell. “anyway, i’m going to\\nsee.”\\n\\nwhat more poirot would have said i do not know, for at that moment\\nthe door flew open, and a splendid-looking man strode into the\\nroom. from his crisply curling black head, to the tips of his\\npatent-leather boots, he was a hero fit for romance.\\n\\n“i said i’d call round for you, mary,” said gregory rolf, “and here\\ni am. well, what does monsieur poirot say to our little problem?\\njust one big hoax, same as i do?”\\n\\npoirot smiled up at the big actor. they made a ridiculous contrast.\\n\\n“hoax or no hoax, mr. rolf,” he said dryly, “i have advised madame\\nyour wife not to take the jewel with her to yardly chase on friday.”\\n\\n“i’m with you there, sir. i’ve already said so to mary. but there!\\nshe’s a woman through and through, and i guess she can’t bear to\\nthink of another woman outshining her in the jewel line.”\\n\\n“what nonsense, gregory!” said mary marvell sharply. but she\\nflushed angrily.\\n\\npoirot shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n“madame, i have advised. i can do no more. _c’est fini_.”\\n\\nhe bowed them both to the door.\\n\\n“ah! _la la_,” he observed, returning. “_histoire de femmes!_ the\\ngood husband, he hit the nail on the head—_tout de même_, he was\\nnot tactful! assuredly not.”\\n\\ni imparted to him my vague remembrances, and he nodded vigorously.\\n\\n“so i thought. all the same, there is something curious underneath\\nall this. with your permission, _mon ami_, i will take the air.\\nawait my return, i beg of you. i shall not be long.”\\n\\ni was half asleep in my chair when the landlady tapped on the door,\\nand put her head in.\\n\\n“it’s another lady to see mr. poirot, sir. i’ve told her he was\\nout, but she says as how she’ll wait, seeing as she’s come up from\\nthe country.”\\n\\n“oh, show her in here, mrs. murchison. perhaps i can do something\\nfor her.”\\n\\nin another moment the lady had been ushered in. my heart gave a\\nleap as i recognized her. lady yardly’s portrait had figured too\\noften in the society papers to allow her to remain unknown.\\n\\n“do sit down, lady yardly,” i said, drawing forward a chair. “my\\nfriend poirot is out, but i know for a fact that he’ll be back very\\nshortly.”\\n\\nshe thanked me and sat down. a very different type, this, from miss\\nmary marvell. tall, dark, with flashing eyes, and a pale proud\\nface—yet something wistful in the curves of the mouth.\\n\\ni felt a desire to rise to the occasion. why not? in poirot’s\\npresence i have frequently felt a difficulty—i do not appear at my\\nbest. and yet there is no doubt that i, too, possess the deductive\\nsense in a marked degree. i leant forward on a sudden impulse.\\n\\n“lady yardly,” i said, “i know why you have come here. you have\\nreceived blackmailing letters about the diamond.”\\n\\nthere was no doubt as to my bolt having shot home. she stared at\\nme open-mouthed, all colour banished from her cheeks.\\n\\n“you know?” she gasped. “how?”\\n\\ni smiled.\\n\\n“by a perfectly logical process. if miss marvell has had warning\\nletters——”\\n\\n“miss marvell? she has been here?”\\n\\n“she has just left. as i was saying, if she, as the holder of one\\nof the twin diamonds, has received a mysterious series of warnings,\\nyou, as the holder of the other stone, must necessarily have done\\nthe same. you see how simple it is? i am right, then, you have\\nreceived these strange communications also?”\\n\\nfor a moment she hesitated, as though in doubt whether to trust me\\nor not, then she bowed her head in assent with a little smile.\\n\\n“that is so,” she acknowledged.\\n\\n“were yours, too, left by hand—by a chinaman?”\\n\\n“no, they came by post; but, tell me, has miss marvell undergone\\nthe same experience, then?”\\n\\ni recounted to her the events of the morning. she listened\\nattentively.\\n\\n“it all fits in. my letters are the duplicates of hers. it is true\\nthat they came by post, but there is a curious perfume impregnating\\nthem—something in the nature of joss-stick—that at once suggested\\nthe east to me. what does it all mean?”\\n\\ni shook my head.\\n\\n“that is what we must find out. you have the letters with you? we\\nmight learn something from the postmarks.”\\n\\n“unfortunately i destroyed them. you understand, at the time i\\nregarded it as some foolish joke. can it be true that some chinese\\ngang are really trying to recover the diamonds? it seems too\\nincredible.”\\n\\nwe went over the facts again and again, but could get no further\\ntowards the elucidation of the mystery. at last lady yardly rose.\\n\\n“i really don’t think i need wait for monsieur poirot. you can tell\\nhim all this, can’t you? thank you so much, mr.——”\\n\\nshe hesitated, her hand outstretched.\\n\\n“captain hastings.”\\n\\n“of course! how stupid of me. you’re a friend of the cavendishes,\\naren’t you? it was mary cavendish who sent me to monsieur poirot.”\\n\\nwhen my friend returned, i enjoyed telling him the tale of what\\nhad occurred during his absence. he cross-questioned me rather\\nsharply over the details of our conversation and i could read\\nbetween the lines that he was not best pleased to have been absent.\\ni also fancied that the dear old fellow was just the least inclined\\nto be jealous. it had become rather a pose with him to consistently\\nbelittle my abilities, and i think he was chagrined at finding no\\nloophole for criticism. i was secretly rather pleased with myself,\\nthough i tried to conceal the fact for fear of irritating him. in\\nspite of his idiosyncrasies, i was deeply attached to my quaint\\nlittle friend.\\n\\n“_bien!_” he said at length, with a curious look on his face. “the\\nplot develops. pass me, i pray you, that ‘peerage’ on the top shelf\\nthere.” he turned the leaves. “ah, here we are! ‘yardly . . . 10th\\nviscount, served south african war’ . . . _tout ça n’a pas\\nd’importance_ . . . ‘mar. 1907 hon. maude stopperton, fourth\\ndaughter of 3rd baron cotteril’ . . . um, um, um, . . . ‘has iss.\\ntwo daughters, born 1908, 1910. . . . clubs . . . residences.’ . . .\\n_voilà_, that does not tell us much. but to-morrow morning we see\\nthis _milord_!”\\n\\n“what?”\\n\\n“yes. i telegraphed to him.”\\n\\n“i thought you had washed your hands of the case?”\\n\\n“i am not acting for miss marvell since she refuses to be guided\\nby my advice. what i do now is for my own satisfaction—the\\nsatisfaction of hercule poirot! decidedly, i must have a finger in\\nthis pie.”\\n\\n“and you calmly wire lord yardly to dash up to town just to suit\\nyour convenience. he won’t be pleased.”\\n\\n“_au contraire_, if i preserve for him his family diamond, he ought\\nto be very grateful.”\\n\\n“then you really think there is a chance of it being stolen?” i\\nasked eagerly.\\n\\n“almost a certainty,” replied poirot placidly. “everything points\\nthat way.”\\n\\n“but how——”\\n\\npoirot stopped my eager questions with an airy gesture of the hand.\\n\\n“not now, i pray you. let us not confuse the mind. and observe that\\n‘peerage’—how you have replaced him! see you not that the tallest\\nbooks go in the top shelf, the next tallest in the row beneath,\\nand so on. thus we have order, _method_, which, as i have often\\ntold you, hastings——”\\n\\n“exactly,” i said hastily, and put the offending volume in its\\nproper place.\\n\\n\\n  •   •   •   •   •   •   •\\n\\n\\nlord yardly turned out to be a cheery, loud-voiced sportsman with\\na rather red face, but with a good-humoured bonhomie about him that\\nwas distinctly attractive and made up for any lack of mentality.\\n\\n“extraordinary business this, monsieur poirot. can’t make head or\\ntail of it. seems my wife’s been getting odd kind of letters, and\\nthat this miss marvell’s had ’em too. what does it all mean?”\\n\\npoirot handed him the copy of _society gossip_.\\n\\n“first, _milord_, i would ask you if these facts are substantially\\ncorrect?”\\n\\nthe peer took it. his face darkened with anger as he read.\\n\\n“damned nonsense!” he spluttered. “there’s never been any romantic\\nstory attaching to the diamond. it came from india originally, i\\nbelieve. i never heard of all this chinese god stuff.”\\n\\n“still, the stone _is_ known as ‘the star of the east.’”\\n\\n“well, what if it is?” he demanded wrathfully.\\n\\npoirot smiled a little, but made no direct reply. “what i would\\nask you to do, _milord_, is to place yourself in my hands. if you\\ndo so unreservedly, i have great hopes of averting the catastrophe.”\\n\\n“then you think there’s actually something in these wild-cat\\ntales?”\\n\\n“will you do as i ask you?”\\n\\n“of course i will, but——”\\n\\n“_bien!_ then permit that i ask you a few questions. this affair\\nof yardly chase, is it, as you say, all fixed up between you and\\nmr. rolf?”\\n\\n“oh, he told you about it, did he? no, there’s nothing settled.”\\nhe hesitated, the brick-red colour of his face deepening. “might\\nas well get the thing straight. i’ve made rather an ass of myself\\nin many ways, monsieur poirot—and i’m head over ears in debt—but\\ni want to pull up. i’m fond of the kids, and i want to straighten\\nthings up, and be able to live on at the old place. gregory rolf\\nis offering me big money—enough to set me on my feet again. i don’t\\nwant to do it—i hate the thought of all that crowd play-acting\\nround the chase—but i may have to, unless——” he broke off.\\n\\npoirot eyed him keenly. “you have, then, another string to your\\nbow? permit that i make a guess? it is to sell the star of the\\neast?”\\n\\nlord yardly nodded. “that’s it. it’s been in the family for some\\ngenerations, but it’s not entailed. still, it’s not the easiest\\nthing in the world to find a purchaser. hoffberg, the hatton garden\\nman, is on the look-out for a likely customer, but he’ll have to\\nfind one soon, or it’s a washout.”\\n\\n“one more question, _permettez_—lady yardly, which plan does she\\napprove?”\\n\\n“oh, she’s bitterly opposed to my selling the jewel. you know what\\nwomen are. she’s all for this film stunt.”\\n\\n“i comprehend,” said poirot. he remained a moment or so in thought,\\nthen rose briskly to his feet. “you return to yardly chase at once?\\n_bien!_ say no word to anyone—to _anyone_ mind—but expect us there\\nthis evening. we will arrive shortly after five.”\\n\\n“all right, but i don’t see——”\\n\\n“_ça n’a pas d’importance_,” said poirot kindly. “you will that i\\npreserve for you your diamond, _n’est-ce pas_?”\\n\\n“yes, but——”\\n\\n“then do as i say.”\\n\\na sadly bewildered nobleman left the room.\\n\\n  •   •   •   •   •   •   •\\n\\nit was half-past five when we arrived at yardly chase, and followed\\nthe dignified butler to the old panelled hall with its fire of\\nblazing logs. a pretty picture met our eyes: lady yardly and her\\ntwo children, the mother’s proud dark head bent down over the two\\nfair ones. lord yardly stood near, smiling down on them.\\n\\n“monsieur poirot and captain hastings,” announced the butler.\\n\\nlady yardly looked up with a start, her husband came forward\\nuncertainly, his eyes seeking instruction from poirot. the little\\nman was equal to the occasion.\\n\\n“all my excuses! it is that i investigate still this affair of miss\\nmarvell’s. she comes to you on friday, does she not? i make a\\nlittle tour first to make sure that all is secure. also i wanted\\nto ask of lady yardly if she recollected at all the postmarks on\\nthe letters she received?”\\n\\nlady yardly shook her head regretfully. “i’m afraid i don’t. it is\\nstupid of me. but, you see, i never dreamt of taking them\\nseriously.”\\n\\n“you’ll stay the night?” said lord yardly.\\n\\n“oh, _milord_, i fear to incommode you. we have left our bags at\\nthe inn.”\\n\\n“that’s all right.” lord yardly had his cue. “we’ll send down for\\nthem. no, no—no trouble, i assure you.”\\n\\npoirot permitted himself to be persuaded, and sitting down by lady\\nyardly, began to make friends with the children. in a short time\\nthey were all romping together, and had dragged me into the game.\\n\\n“_vous êtes bonne mère_,” said poirot, with a gallant little bow,\\nas the children were removed reluctantly by a stern nurse.\\n\\nlady yardly smoothed her ruffled hair.\\n\\n“i adore them,” she said with a little catch in her voice.\\n\\n“and they you—with reason!” poirot bowed again.\\n\\na dressing-gong sounded, and we rose to go up to our rooms. at that\\nmoment the butler entered with a telegram on a salver which he\\nhanded to lord yardly. the latter tore it open with a brief word\\nof apology. as he read it he stiffened visibly.\\n\\nwith an ejaculation, he handed it to his wife. then he glanced at\\nmy friend.\\n\\n“just a minute, monsieur poirot. i feel you ought to know about\\nthis. it’s from hoffberg. he thinks he’s found a customer for the\\ndiamond—an american, sailing for the states to-morrow. they’re\\nsending down a chap to-night to vet the stone. by jove, though, if\\nthis goes through——” words failed him.\\n\\nlady yardly had turned away. she still held the telegram in her\\nhand.\\n\\n“i wish you wouldn’t sell it, george,” she said, in a low voice.\\n“it’s been in the family so long.” she waited, as though for a\\nreply, but when none came her face hardened. she shrugged her\\nshoulders. “i must go and dress. i suppose i had better display\\n‘the goods.’” she turned to poirot with a slight grimace. “it’s\\none of the most hideous necklaces that was ever designed! george\\nhas always promised to have the stones reset for me, but it’s never\\nbeen done.” she left the room.\\n\\nhalf an hour later, we three were assembled in the great drawing-room\\nawaiting the lady. it was already a few minutes past the dinner\\nhour.\\n\\nsuddenly there was a low rustle, and lady yardly appeared framed\\nin the doorway, a radiant figure in a long white shimmering dress.\\nround the column of her neck was a rivulet of fire. she stood there\\nwith one hand just touching the necklace.\\n\\n“behold the sacrifice,” she said gaily. her ill-humour seemed to\\nhave vanished. “wait while i turn the big light on and you shall\\nfeast your eyes on the ugliest necklace in england.”\\n\\nthe switches were just outside the door. as she stretched out her\\nhand to them, the incredible thing happened. suddenly without any\\nwarning, every light was extinguished, the door banged, and from\\nthe other side of it came a long-drawn piercing woman’s scream.\\n\\n“my god!” cried lord yardly. “that was maude’s voice! what has\\nhappened?”\\n\\nwe rushed blindly for the door, cannoning into each other in the\\ndarkness. it was some minutes before we could find it. what a sight\\nmet our eyes! lady yardly lay senseless on the marble floor, a\\ncrimson mark on her white throat where the necklace had been\\nwrenched from her neck.\\n\\nas we bent over her, uncertain for the moment whether she were dead\\nor alive, her eyelids opened.\\n\\n“the chinaman,” she whispered painfully. “the chinaman—the side\\ndoor.”\\n\\nlord yardly sprang up with an oath. i accompanied him, my heart\\nbeating wildly. the chinaman again! the side door in question was\\na small one in the angle of the wall, not more than a dozen yards\\nfrom the scene of the tragedy. as we reached it, i gave a cry.\\nthere, just short of the threshold, lay the glittering necklace,\\nevidently dropped by the thief in the panic of his flight. i\\nswooped joyously down on it. then i uttered another cry which lord\\nyardly echoed. for in the middle of the necklace was a great gap.\\nthe star of the east was missing!\\n\\n“that settles it,” i breathed. “these were no ordinary thieves.\\nthis one stone was all they wanted.”\\n\\n“but how did the fellow get in?”\\n\\n“through this door.”\\n\\n“but it’s always locked.”\\n\\ni shook my head. “it’s not locked now. see.” i pulled it open as\\ni spoke.\\n\\nas i did so something fluttered to the ground. i picked it up. it\\nwas a piece of silk, and the embroidery was unmistakable. it had\\nbeen torn from a chinaman’s robe.\\n\\n“in his haste it caught in the door,” i explained. “come, hurry.\\nhe cannot have gone far as yet.”\\n\\nbut in vain we hunted and searched. in the pitch darkness of the\\nnight, the thief had found it easy to make his getaway. we returned\\nreluctantly, and lord yardly sent off one of the footmen post-haste\\nto fetch the police.\\n\\nlady yardly, aptly ministered to by poirot, who is as good as a\\nwoman in these matters, was sufficiently recovered to be able to\\ntell her story.\\n\\n“i was just going to turn on the other light,” she said, “when a\\nman sprang on me from behind. he tore my necklace from my neck with\\nsuch force that i fell headlong to the floor. as i fell i saw him\\ndisappearing through the side door. then i realized by the pig-tail\\nand the embroidered robe that he was a chinaman.” she stopped with\\na shudder.\\n\\nthe butler reappeared. he spoke in a low voice to lord yardly.\\n\\n“a gentleman from mr. hoffberg’s, m’lord. he says you expect him.”\\n\\n“good heavens!” cried the distracted nobleman. “i must see him, i\\nsuppose. no, not here, mullings, in the library.”\\n\\ni drew poirot aside.\\n\\n“look here, my dear fellow, hadn’t we better get back to london?”\\n\\n“you think so, hastings? why?”\\n\\n“well”—i coughed delicately—“things haven’t gone very well, have\\nthey? i mean, you tell lord yardly to place himself in your hands\\nand all will be well—and then the diamond vanishes from under your\\nvery nose!”\\n\\n“true,” said poirot, rather crestfallen. “it was not one of my most\\nstriking triumphs.”\\n\\nthis way of describing events almost caused me to smile, but i\\nstuck to my guns.\\n\\n“so, having—pardon the expression—rather made a mess of things,\\ndon’t you think it would be more graceful to leave immediately?”\\n\\n“and the dinner, the without doubt excellent dinner, that the\\n_chef_ of lord yardly has prepared?”\\n\\n“oh, what’s dinner!” i said impatiently.\\n\\npoirot held up his hands in horror.\\n\\n“_mon dieu!_ it is that in this country you treat the affairs\\ngastronomic with a criminal indifference.”\\n\\n“there’s another reason why we should get back to london as soon\\nas possible,” i continued.\\n\\n“what is that, my friend?”\\n\\n“the other diamond,” i said, lowering my voice. “miss marvell’s.”\\n\\n“_eh bien_, what of it?”\\n\\n“don’t you see?” his unusual obtuseness annoyed me. what had\\nhappened to his usually keen wits? “they’ve got one, now they’ll\\ngo for the other.”\\n\\n“_tiens!_” cried poirot, stepping back a pace and regarding me with\\nadmiration. “but your brain marches to a marvel, my friend! figure\\nto yourself that for the moment i had not thought of that! but\\nthere is plenty of time. the full of the moon, it is not until\\nfriday.”\\n\\ni shook my head dubiously. the full of the moon theory left me\\nentirely cold. i had my way with poirot, however, and we departed\\nimmediately, leaving behind us a note of explanation and apology\\nfor lord yardly.\\n\\nmy idea was to go at once to the _magnificent_, and relate to miss\\nmarvell what had occurred, but poirot vetoed the plan, and insisted\\nthat the morning would be time enough. i gave in rather grudgingly.\\n\\nin the morning poirot seemed strangely disinclined to stir out. i\\nbegan to suspect that, having made a mistake to start with, he was\\nsingularly loath to proceed with the case. in answer to my\\npersuasions, he pointed out, with admirable common sense, that as\\nthe details of the affair at yardly chase were already in the\\nmorning papers the rolfs would know quite as much as we could tell\\nthem. i gave way unwillingly.\\n\\nevents proved my forebodings to be justified. about two o’clock,\\nthe telephone rang. poirot answered it. he listened for some\\nmoments, then with a brief “_bien, j’y serai_” he rang off, and\\nturned to me.\\n\\n“what do you think, _mon ami_?” he looked half ashamed, half\\nexcited. “the diamond of miss marvell, it has been stolen.”\\n\\n“what?” i cried, springing up. “and what about the ‘full of the\\nmoon’ now?” poirot hung his head. “when did this happen?”\\n\\n“this morning, i understand.”\\n\\ni shook my head sadly. “if only you had listened to me. you see i\\nwas right.”\\n\\n“it appears so, _mon ami_,” said poirot cautiously. “appearances\\nare deceptive, they say, but it certainly appears so.”\\n\\nas we hurried in a taxi to the _magnificent_, i puzzled out the\\ntrue inwardness of the scheme.\\n\\n“that ‘full of the moon’ idea was clever. the whole point of it\\nwas to get us to concentrate on the friday, and so be off our guard\\nbeforehand. it is a pity you did not realize that.”\\n\\n“_ma foi!_” said poirot airily, his nonchalance quite restored\\nafter its brief eclipse. “one cannot think of everything!”\\n\\ni felt sorry for him. he did so hate failure of any kind.\\n\\n“cheer up,” i said consolingly. “better luck next time.”\\n\\nat the _magnificent_, we were ushered at once into the manager’s\\noffice. gregory rolf was there with two men from scotland yard. a\\npale-faced clerk sat opposite them.\\n\\nrolf nodded to us as we entered.\\n\\n“we’re getting to the bottom of it,” he said. “but it’s almost\\nunbelievable. how the guy had the nerve i can’t think.”\\n\\na very few minutes sufficed to give us the facts. mr. rolf had gone\\nout of the hotel at 11.15. at 11.30, a gentleman, so like him in\\nappearance as to pass muster, entered the hotel and demanded the\\njewel-case from the safe deposit. he duly signed the receipt,\\nremarking carelessly as he did so: “looks a bit different from my\\nordinary one, but i hurt my hand getting out of the taxi.” the\\nclerk merely smiled and remarked that he saw very little difference.\\nrolf laughed and said: “well, don’t run me in as a crook this time,\\nanyway. i’ve been getting threatening letters from a chinaman, and\\nthe worst of it is i look rather like a chink myself—it’s something\\nabout the eyes.”\\n\\n“i looked at him,” said the clerk who was telling us this, “and i\\nsaw at once what he meant. the eyes slanted up at the corners like\\nan oriental’s. i’d never noticed it before.”\\n\\n“darn it all, man,” roared gregory rolf, leaning forward, “do you\\nnotice it now?”\\n\\nthe man looked up at him and started.\\n\\n“no, sir,” he said. “i can’t say i do.” and indeed there was\\nnothing even remotely oriental about the frank brown eyes that\\nlooked into ours.\\n\\nthe scotland yard man grunted. “bold customer. thought the eyes\\nmight be noticed, and took the bull by the horns to disarm\\nsuspicion. he must have watched you out of the hotel, sir, and\\nnipped in as soon as you were well away.”\\n\\n“what about the jewel-case?” i asked.\\n\\n“it was found in a corridor of the hotel. only one thing had been\\ntaken—‘the western star.’”\\n\\nwe stared at each other—the whole thing was so bizarre, so unreal.\\n\\npoirot hopped briskly to his feet. “i have not been of much use,\\ni fear,” he said regretfully. “is it permitted to see madame?”\\n\\n“i guess she’s prostrated with the shock,” explained rolf.\\n\\n“then perhaps i might have a few words alone with you, monsieur?”\\n\\n“certainly.”\\n\\nin about five minutes poirot reappeared.\\n\\n“now, my friend,” he said gaily. “to a post office. i have to send\\na telegram.”\\n\\n“who to?”\\n\\n“lord yardly.” he discounted further inquiries by slipping his arm\\nthrough mine. “come, come, _mon ami_. i know all that you feel\\nabout this miserable business. i have not distinguished myself!\\nyou, in my place, might have distinguished yourself! _bien!_ all\\nis admitted. let us forget it and have lunch.”\\n\\nit was about four o’clock when we entered poirot’s rooms. a figure\\nrose from a chair by the window. it was lord yardly. he looked\\nhaggard and distraught.\\n\\n“i got your wire and came up at once. look here, i’ve been round\\nto hoffberg, and they know nothing about that man of theirs last\\nnight, or the wire either. do you think that——”\\n\\npoirot held up his hand.\\n\\n“my excuses! i sent that wire, and hired the gentleman in question.”\\n\\n“_you_—but why? what?” the nobleman spluttered impotently.\\n\\n“my little idea was to bring things to a head,” explained poirot\\nplacidly.\\n\\n“bring things to a head! oh, my god!” cried lord yardly.\\n\\n“and the ruse succeeded,” said poirot cheerfully. “therefore,\\n_milord_, i have much pleasure in returning you—this!” with a\\ndramatic gesture he produced a glittering object. it was a great\\ndiamond.\\n\\n“the star of the east,” gasped lord yardly. “but i don’t\\nunderstand——”\\n\\n“no?” said poirot. “it makes no matter. believe me, it was necessary\\nfor the diamond to be stolen. i promised you that it should be\\npreserved to you, and i have kept my word. you must permit me to\\nkeep my little secret. convey, i beg of you, the assurances of my\\ndeepest respect to lady yardly, and tell her how pleased i am to\\nbe able to restore her jewel to her. what _beau temps_, is it not?\\ngood day, _milord_.”\\n\\nand smiling and talking, the amazing little man conducted the\\nbewildered nobleman to the door. he returned gently rubbing his\\nhands.\\n\\n“poirot,” i said. “am i quite demented?”\\n\\n“no, _mon ami_, but you are, as always, in a mental fog.”\\n\\n“how did you get the diamond.”\\n\\n“from mr. rolf.”\\n\\n“rolf?”\\n\\n“_mais oui!_ the warning letters, the chinaman, the article in\\n_society gossip_, all sprang from the ingenious brain of mr. rolf!\\nthe two diamonds, supposed to be so miraculously alike—bah! they\\ndid not exist. there was only _one_ diamond, my friend! originally\\nin the yardly collection, for three years it has been in the\\npossession of mr. rolf. he stole it this morning with the assistance\\nof a touch of grease paint at the corner of each eye! ah, i must\\nsee him on the film, he is indeed an artist, _celui-là_!\\n\\n“but why should he steal his own diamond?” i asked, puzzled.\\n\\n“for many reasons. to begin with, lady yardly was getting restive.”\\n\\n“lady yardly?”\\n\\n“you comprehend she was left much alone in california. her husband\\nwas amusing himself elsewhere. mr. rolf was handsome, he had an\\nair about him of romance. but _au fond_, he is very business-like,\\n_ce monsieur_! he made love to lady yardly, and then he blackmailed\\nher. i taxed the lady with the truth the other night, and she\\nadmitted it. she swore that she had only been indiscreet, and i\\nbelieve her. but, undoubtedly, rolf had letters of hers that could\\nbe twisted to bear a different interpretation. terrified by the\\nthreat of a divorce, and the prospect of being separated from her\\nchildren, she agreed to all he wished. she had no money of her own,\\nand she was forced to permit him to substitute a paste replica for\\nthe real stone. the coincidence of the date of the appearance of\\n‘the western star’ struck me at once. all goes well. lord yardly\\nprepares to range himself—to settle down. and then comes the menace\\nof the possible sale of the diamond. the substitution will be\\ndiscovered. without doubt she writes off frantically to gregory\\nrolf who has just arrived in england. he soothes her by promising\\nto arrange all—and prepares for a double robbery. in this way he\\nwill quiet the lady, who might conceivably tell all to her husband,\\nan affair which would not suit our blackmailer at all, he will have\\n£50,000 insurance money (aha, you had forgotten that!), and he will\\nstill have the diamond! at this point i put my finger in the pie.\\nthe arrival of a diamond expert is announced. lady yardly, as i\\nfelt sure she would, immediately arranges a robbery—and does it\\nvery well too! but hercule poirot, he sees nothing but facts. what\\nhappens in actuality? the lady switches off the light, bangs the\\ndoor, throws the necklace down the passage, and screams. she has\\nalready wrenched out the diamond with pliers upstairs——”\\n\\n“but we saw the necklace round her neck!” i objected.\\n\\n“i demand pardon, my friend. her hand concealed the part of it\\nwhere the gap would have shown. to place a piece of silk in the\\ndoor beforehand is child’s play! of course, as soon as rolf read\\nof the robbery, he arranged his own little comedy. and very well\\nhe played it!”\\n\\n“what did you say to him?” i asked with lively curiosity.\\n\\n“i said to him that lady yardly had told her husband all, that i\\nwas empowered to recover the jewel, and that if it were not\\nimmediately handed over proceedings would be taken. also a few more\\nlittle lies which occurred to me. he was as wax in my hands!”\\n\\ni pondered the matter.\\n\\n“it seems a little unfair on mary marvell. she has lost her diamond\\nthrough no fault of her own.”\\n\\n“bah!” said poirot brutally. “she has a magnificent advertisement.\\nthat is all she cares for, that one! now the other, she is\\ndifferent. _bonne mère, très femme!_”\\n\\n“yes,” i said doubtfully, hardly sharing poirot’s views on\\nfemininity. “i suppose it was rolf who sent her the duplicate\\nletters.”\\n\\n“_pas du tout_,” said poirot briskly. “she came by the advice of\\nmary cavendish to seek my aid in her dilemma. then she heard that\\nmary marvell, whom she knew to be her enemy, had been here, and\\nshe changed her mind, jumping at a pretext that _you_, my friend,\\noffered her. a very few questions sufficed to show me that _you_\\ntold her of the letters, not she you! she jumped at the chance your\\nwords offered.”\\n\\n“i don’t believe it,” i cried, stung.\\n\\n“_si, si, mon ami_, it is a pity that you study not the psychology.\\nshe told you that the letters were destroyed? oh, la la, _never_\\ndoes a woman destroy a letter if she can avoid it! not even if it\\nwould be more prudent to do so!”\\n\\n“it’s all very well,” i said, my anger rising, “but you’ve made a\\nperfect fool of me! from beginning to end! no, it’s all very well\\nto try and explain it away afterwards. there really is a limit!”\\n\\n“but you were so enjoying yourself, my friend. i had not the heart\\nto shatter your illusions.”\\n\\n“it’s no good. you’ve gone a bit too far this time.”\\n\\n“_mon dieu!_ but how you enrage yourself for nothing, _mon ami_!”\\n\\n“i’m fed up!” i went out, banging the door. poirot had made an\\nabsolute laughing-stock of me. i decided that he needed a sharp\\nlesson. i would let some time elapse before i forgave him. he had\\nencouraged me to make a perfect fool of myself!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  ii\\n\\n\\n  the tragedy at marsdon manor\\n\\n\\ni had been called away from town for a few days, and on my return\\nfound poirot in the act of strapping up his small valise.\\n\\n“_a la bonne heure_, hastings. i feared you would not have returned\\nin time to accompany me.”\\n\\n“you are called away on a case, then?”\\n\\n“yes, though i am bound to admit that, on the face of it, the\\naffair does not seem promising. the northern union insurance\\ncompany have asked me to investigate the death of a mr. maltravers\\nwho a few weeks ago insured his life with them for the large sum\\nof fifty thousand pounds.”\\n\\n“yes?” i said, much interested.\\n\\n“there was, of course, the usual suicide clause in the policy. in\\nthe event of his committing suicide within a year the premiums\\nwould be forfeited. mr. maltravers was duly examined by the\\ncompany’s own doctor, and although he was a man slightly past the\\nprime of life was passed as being in quite sound health. however,\\non wednesday last—the day before yesterday—the body of mr.\\nmaltravers was found in the grounds of his house in essex, marsdon\\nmanor, and the cause of his death is described as some kind of\\ninternal hæmorrhage. that in itself would be nothing remarkable,\\nbut sinister rumours as to mr. maltravers’ financial position have\\nbeen in the air of late, and the northern union have ascertained\\nbeyond any possible doubt that the deceased gentleman stood upon\\nthe verge of bankruptcy. now that alters matters considerably.\\nmaltravers had a beautiful young wife, and it is suggested that he\\ngot together all the ready money he could for the purpose of paying\\nthe premiums on a life insurance for his wife’s benefit, and then\\ncommitted suicide. such a thing is not uncommon. in any case, my\\nfriend alfred wright, who is a director of the northern union, has\\nasked me to investigate the facts of the case, but, as i told him,\\ni am not very hopeful of success. if the cause of the death had\\nbeen heart failure, i should have been more sanguine. heart failure\\nmay always be translated as the inability of the local g.p. to\\ndiscover what his patient really did die of, but a hæmorrhage seems\\nfairly definite. still, we can but make some necessary inquiries.\\nfive minutes to pack your bag, hastings, and we will take a taxi\\nto liverpool street.”\\n\\nabout an hour later, we alighted from a great eastern train at the\\nlittle station of marsdon leigh. inquiries at the station yielded\\nthe information that marsdon manor was about a mile distant. poirot\\ndecided to walk, and we betook ourselves along the main street.\\n\\n“what is our plan of campaign?” i asked.\\n\\n“first i will call upon the doctor. i have ascertained that there\\nis only one doctor in marsdon leigh, dr. ralph bernard. ah, here\\nwe are at his house.”\\n\\nthe house in question was a kind of superior cottage, standing back\\na little from the road. a brass plate on the gate bore the doctor’s\\nname. we passed up the path and rang the bell.\\n\\nwe proved to be fortunate in our call. it was the doctor’s\\nconsulting hour, and for the moment there were no patients waiting\\nfor him. dr. bernard was an elderly man, high-shouldered and\\nstooping, with a pleasant vagueness of manner.\\n\\npoirot introduced himself and explained the purpose of our visit,\\nadding that insurance companies were bound to investigate fully in\\na case of this kind.\\n\\n“of course, of course,” said dr. bernard vaguely. “i suppose, as\\nhe was such a rich man, his life was insured for a big sum?”\\n\\n“you consider him a rich man, doctor?”\\n\\nthe doctor looked rather surprised.\\n\\n“was he not? he kept two cars, you know, and marsdon manor is a\\npretty big place to keep up, although i believe he bought it very\\ncheap.”\\n\\n“i understand that he had had considerable losses of late,” said\\npoirot, watching the doctor narrowly.\\n\\nthe latter, however, merely shook his head sadly.\\n\\n“is that so? indeed. it is fortunate for his wife, then, that there\\nis this life insurance. a very beautiful and charming young\\ncreature, but terribly unstrung by this sad catastrophe. a mass of\\nnerves, poor thing. i have tried to spare her all i can, but of\\ncourse the shock was bound to be considerable.”\\n\\n“you had been attending mr. maltravers recently?”\\n\\n“my dear sir, i never attended him.”\\n\\n“what?”\\n\\n“i understand mr. maltravers was a christian scientist—or something\\nof that kind.”\\n\\n“but you examined the body?”\\n\\n“certainly. i was fetched by one of the under-gardeners.”\\n\\n“and the cause of death was clear?”\\n\\n“absolutely. there was blood on the lips, but most of the bleeding\\nmust have been internal.”\\n\\n“was he still lying where he had been found?”\\n\\n“yes, the body had not been touched. he was lying at the edge of\\na small plantation. he had evidently been out shooting rooks, a\\nsmall rook rifle lay beside him. the hæmorrhage must have occurred\\nquite suddenly. gastric ulcer, without a doubt.”\\n\\n“no question of his having been shot, eh?”\\n\\n“my dear sir!”\\n\\n“i demand pardon,” said poirot humbly. “but, if my memory is not\\nat fault, in the case of a recent murder, the doctor first gave a\\nverdict of heart failure—altering it when the local constable\\npointed out that there was a bullet wound through the head!”\\n\\n“you will not find any bullet wounds on the body of mr. maltravers,”\\nsaid dr. bernard dryly. “now, gentlemen, if there is nothing\\nfurther——”\\n\\nwe took the hint.\\n\\n“good morning, and many thanks to you, doctor, for so kindly\\nanswering our questions. by the way, you saw no need for an\\nautopsy?”\\n\\n“certainly not.” the doctor became quite apoplectic. “the cause of\\ndeath was clear, and in my profession we see no need to distress\\nunduly the relatives of a dead patient.”\\n\\nand, turning, the doctor slammed the door sharply in our faces.\\n\\n“and what do you think of dr. bernard, hastings?” inquired poirot,\\nas we proceeded on our way to the manor.\\n\\n“rather an old ass.”\\n\\n“exactly. your judgments of character are always profound, my\\nfriend.”\\n\\ni glanced at him uneasily, but he seemed perfectly serious. a\\ntwinkle, however, came into his eye, and he added slyly:\\n\\n“that is to say, when there is no question of a beautiful woman!”\\n\\ni looked at him coldly.\\n\\non our arrival at the manor-house, the door was opened to us by a\\nmiddle-aged parlourmaid. poirot handed her his card, and a letter\\nfrom the insurance company for mrs. maltravers. she showed us into\\na small morning-room, and retired to tell her mistress. about ten\\nminutes elapsed, and then the door opened, and a slender figure in\\nwidow’s weeds stood upon the threshold.\\n\\n“monsieur poirot?” she faltered.\\n\\n“madame!” poirot sprang gallantly to his feet and hastened towards\\nher. “i cannot tell you how i regret to derange you in this way.\\nbut what will you? _les affaires_—they know no mercy.”\\n\\nmrs. maltravers permitted him to lead her to a chair. her eyes were\\nred with weeping, but the temporary disfigurement could not conceal\\nher extraordinary beauty. she was about twenty-seven or eight, and\\nvery fair, with large blue eyes and a pretty pouting mouth.\\n\\n“it is something about my husband’s insurance, is it? but must i\\nbe bothered _now_—so soon?”\\n\\n“courage, my dear madame. courage! you see, your late husband\\ninsured his life for rather a large sum, and in such a case the\\ncompany always has to satisfy itself as to a few details. they have\\nempowered me to act for them. you can rest assured that i will do\\nall in my power to render the matter not too unpleasant for you.\\nwill you recount to me briefly the sad events of wednesday?”\\n\\n“i was changing for tea when my maid came up—one of the gardeners\\nhad just run to the house. he had found——”\\n\\nher voice trailed away. poirot pressed her hand sympathetically.\\n\\n“i comprehend. enough! you had seen your husband earlier in the\\nafternoon?”\\n\\n“not since lunch. i had walked down to the village for some stamps,\\nand i believe he was out pottering round the grounds.”\\n\\n“shooting rooks, eh?”\\n\\n“yes, he usually took his little rook rifle with him, and i heard\\none or two shots in the distance.”\\n\\n“where is this little rook rifle now?”\\n\\n“in the hall, i think.”\\n\\nshe led the way out of the room and found and handed the little\\nweapon to poirot, who examined it cursorily.\\n\\n“two shots fired, i see,” he observed, as he handed it back. “and\\nnow, madame, if i might see——”\\n\\nhe paused delicately.\\n\\n“the servant shall take you,” she murmured, averting her head.\\n\\nthe parlourmaid, summoned, led poirot upstairs. i remained with\\nthe lovely and unfortunate woman. it was hard to know whether to\\nspeak or remain silent. i essayed one or two general reflections\\nto which she responded absently, and in a very few minutes poirot\\nrejoined us.\\n\\n“i thank you for all your courtesy, madame. i do not think you need\\nbe troubled any further with this matter. by the way, do you know\\nanything of your husband’s financial position?”\\n\\nshe shook her head.\\n\\n“nothing whatever. i am very stupid over business things.”\\n\\n“i see. then you can give us no clue as to why he suddenly decided\\nto insure his life? he had not done so previously, i understand.”\\n\\n“well, we had only been married a little over a year. but, as to\\nwhy he insured his life, it was because he had absolutely made up\\nhis mind that he would not live long. he had a strong premonition\\nof his own death. i gather that he had had one hæmorrhage already,\\nand that he knew that another one would prove fatal. i tried to\\ndispel these gloomy fears of his, but without avail. alas, he was\\nonly too right!”\\n\\ntears in her eyes, she bade us a dignified farewell. poirot made\\na characteristic gesture as we walked down the drive together.\\n\\n“_eh bien_, that is that! back to london, my friend, there appears\\nto be no mouse in this mouse-hole. and yet——”\\n\\n“yet what?”\\n\\n“a slight discrepancy, that is all! you noticed it? you did not?\\nstill, life is full of discrepancies, and assuredly the man cannot\\nhave taken his own life—there is no poison that would fill his\\nmouth with blood. no, no, i must resign myself to the fact that\\nall here is clear and above-board—but who is this?”\\n\\na tall young man was striding up the drive towards us. he passed\\nus without making any sign, but i noted that he was not ill-looking,\\nwith a lean, deeply bronzed face that spoke of life in a tropic\\nclime. a gardener who was sweeping up leaves had paused for a\\nminute in his task, and poirot ran quickly up to him.\\n\\n“tell me, i pray you, who is that gentleman? do you know him?”\\n\\n“i don’t remember his name, sir, though i did hear it. he was\\nstaying down here last week for a night. tuesday, it was.”\\n\\n“quick, _mon ami_, let us follow him.”\\n\\nwe hastened up the drive after the retreating figure. a glimpse of\\na black-robed figure on the terrace at the side of the house, and\\nour quarry swerved and we after him, so that we were witnesses of\\nthe meeting.\\n\\nmrs. maltravers almost staggered where she stood, and her face\\nblanched noticeably.\\n\\n“you,” she gasped. “i thought you were on the sea—on your way to\\neast africa?”\\n\\n“i got some news from my lawyers that detained me,” explained the\\nyoung man. “my old uncle in scotland died unexpectedly and left me\\nsome money. under the circumstances i thought it better to cancel\\nmy passage. then i saw this bad news in the paper and i came down\\nto see if there was anything i could do. you’ll want some one to\\nlook after things for you a bit perhaps.”\\n\\nat that moment they became aware of our presence. poirot stepped\\nforward, and with many apologies explained that he had left his\\nstick in the hall. rather reluctantly, it seemed to me, mrs.\\nmaltravers made the necessary introduction.\\n\\n“monsieur poirot, captain black.”\\n\\na few minutes’ chat ensued, in the course of which poirot elicited\\nthe fact that captain black was putting up at the anchor inn. the\\nmissing stick not having been discovered (which was not surprising),\\npoirot uttered more apologies and we withdrew.\\n\\nwe returned to the village at a great pace, and poirot made a bee\\nline for the anchor inn.\\n\\n“here we establish ourselves until our friend the captain returns,”\\nhe explained. “you notice that i emphasized the point that we were\\nreturning to london by the first train? possibly you thought i\\nmeant it. but no—you observed mrs. maltravers’ face when she caught\\nsight of this young black? she was clearly taken aback, and he—_eh\\nbien_, he was very devoted, did you not think so? and he was here\\non tuesday night—the day before mr. maltravers died. we must\\ninvestigate the doings of captain black, hastings.”\\n\\nin about half an hour we espied our quarry approaching the inn.\\npoirot went out and accosted him and presently brought him up to\\nthe room we had engaged.\\n\\n“i have been telling captain black of the mission which brings us\\nhere,” he explained. “you can understand, _monsieur le capitaine_,\\nthat i am anxious to arrive at mr. maltravers’ state of mind\\nimmediately before his death, and that at the same time i do not\\nwish to distress mrs. maltravers unduly by asking her painful\\nquestions. now, you were here just before the occurrence, and can\\ngive us equally valuable information.”\\n\\n“i’ll do anything i can to help you, i’m sure,” replied the young\\nsoldier; “but i’m afraid i didn’t notice anything out of the\\nordinary. you see, although maltravers was an old friend of my\\npeople’s, i didn’t know him very well myself.”\\n\\n“you came down—when?”\\n\\n“tuesday afternoon. i went up to town early wednesday morning, as\\nmy boat sailed from tilbury about twelve o’clock. but some news i\\ngot made me alter my plans, as i dare say you heard me explain to\\nmrs. maltravers.”\\n\\n“you were returning to east africa, i understand?”\\n\\n“yes. i’ve been out there ever since the war—a great country.”\\n\\n“exactly. now what was the talk about at dinner on tuesday night?”\\n\\n“oh, i don’t know. the usual odd topics. maltravers asked after my\\npeople, and then we discussed the question of german reparations,\\nand then mrs. maltravers asked a lot of questions about east\\nafrica, and i told them one or two yarns, that’s about all, i\\nthink.”\\n\\n“thank you.”\\n\\npoirot was silent for a moment, then he said gently: “with your\\npermission, i should like to try a little experiment. you have told\\nus all that your conscious self knows, i want now to question your\\nsubconscious self.”\\n\\n“psychoanalysis, what?” said black, with visible alarm.\\n\\n“oh, no,” said poirot reassuringly. “you see, it is like this, i\\ngive you a word, you answer with another, and so on. any word, the\\nfirst one you think of. shall we begin?”\\n\\n“all right,” said black slowly, but he looked uneasy.\\n\\n“note down the words, please, hastings,” said poirot. then he took\\nfrom his pocket his big turnip-faced watch and laid it on the table\\nbeside him. “we will commence. day.”\\n\\nthere was a moment’s pause, and then black replied:\\n\\n“_night_.”\\n\\nas poirot proceeded, his answers came quicker.\\n\\n“name,” said poirot.\\n\\n“_place_.”\\n\\n“bernard.”\\n\\n“_shaw_.”\\n\\n“tuesday.”\\n\\n“_dinner_.”\\n\\n“journey.”\\n\\n“_ship_.”\\n\\n“country.”\\n\\n“_uganda_.”\\n\\n“story.”\\n\\n“_lions_.”\\n\\n“rook rifle.”\\n\\n“_farm_.”\\n\\n“shot.”\\n\\n“_suicide_.”\\n\\n“elephant.”\\n\\n“_tusks_.”\\n\\n“money.”\\n\\n“_lawyers_.”\\n\\n“thank you, captain black. perhaps you could spare me a few minutes\\nin about half an hour’s time?”\\n\\n“certainly.” the young soldier looked at him curiously and wiped\\nhis brow as he got up.\\n\\n“and now, hastings,” said poirot, smiling at me as the door closed\\nbehind him. “you see it all, do you not?”\\n\\n“i don’t know what you mean.”\\n\\n“does that list of words tell you nothing?”\\n\\ni scrutinized it, but was forced to shake my head.\\n\\n“i will assist you. to begin with, black answered well within the\\nnormal time limit, with no pauses, so we can take it that he\\nhimself has no guilty knowledge to conceal. ‘day’ to ‘night’ and\\n‘place’ to ‘name’ are normal associations. i began work with\\n‘bernard’ which might have suggested the local doctor had he come\\nacross him at all. evidently he had not. after our recent\\nconversation, he gave ‘dinner’ to my ‘tuesday,’ but ‘journey’ and\\n‘country’ were answered by ‘ship’ and ‘uganda,’ showing clearly\\nthat it was his journey abroad that was important to him and not\\nthe one which brought him down here. ‘story’ recalls to him one of\\nthe ‘lion’ stories he told at dinner. i proceed to ‘rook rifle’\\nand he answered with the totally unexpected word ‘farm.’ when i\\nsay ‘shot,’ he answers at once ‘suicide.’ the association seems\\nclear. a man he knows committed suicide with a rook rifle on a farm\\nsomewhere. remember, too, that his mind is still on the stories he\\ntold at dinner, and i think you will agree that i shall not be far\\nfrom the truth if i recall captain black and ask him to repeat the\\nparticular suicide story which he told at the dinner-table on\\ntuesday evening.”\\n\\nblack was straightforward enough over the matter.\\n\\n“yes, i did tell them that story now that i come to think of it.\\nchap shot himself on a farm out there. did it with a rook rifle\\nthrough the roof of the mouth, bullet lodged in the brain. doctors\\nwere no end puzzled over it—there was nothing to show except a\\nlittle blood on the lips. but what——”\\n\\n“what has it got to do with mr. maltravers? you did not know, i\\nsee, that he was found with a rook rifle by his side.”\\n\\n“you mean my story suggested to him—oh, but that is awful!”\\n\\n“do not distress yourself—it would have been one way or another.\\nwell, i must get on the telephone to london.”\\n\\npoirot had a lengthy conversation over the wire, and came back\\nthoughtful. he went off by himself in the afternoon, and it was\\nnot till seven o’clock that he announced that he could put it off\\nno longer, but must break the news to the young widow. my sympathy\\nhad already gone out to her unreservedly. to be left penniless,\\nand with the knowledge that her husband had killed himself to\\nassure her future was a hard burden for any woman to bear. i\\ncherished a secret hope, however, that young black might prove\\ncapable of consoling her after her first grief had passed. he\\nevidently admired her enormously.\\n\\nour interview with the lady was painful. she refused vehemently to\\nbelieve the facts that poirot advanced, and when she was at last\\nconvinced broke down into bitter weeping. an examination of the\\nbody turned our suspicions into certainty. poirot was very sorry\\nfor the poor lady, but, after all, he was employed by the insurance\\ncompany, and what could he do? as he was preparing to leave he said\\ngently to mrs. maltravers:\\n\\n“madame, you of all people should know that there are no dead!”\\n\\n“what do you mean?” she faltered, her eyes growing wide.\\n\\n“have you never taken part in any spiritualistic séances? you are\\nmediumistic, you know.”\\n\\n“i have been told so. but you do not believe in spiritualism,\\nsurely?”\\n\\n“madame, i have seen some strange things. you know that they say\\nin the village that this house is haunted?”\\n\\nshe nodded, and at that moment the parlourmaid announced that\\ndinner was ready.\\n\\n“won’t you just stay and have something to eat?”\\n\\nwe accepted gratefully, and i felt that our presence could not but\\nhelp distract her a little from her own griefs.\\n\\nwe had just finished our soup, when there was a scream outside the\\ndoor, and the sound of breaking crockery. we jumped up. the\\nparlourmaid appeared, her hand to her heart.\\n\\n“it was a man—standing in the passage.”\\n\\npoirot rushed out, returning quickly.\\n\\n“there is no one there.”\\n\\n“isn’t there, sir?” said the parlourmaid weakly. “oh, it did give\\nme a start!”\\n\\n“but why?”\\n\\nshe dropped her voice to a whisper.\\n\\n“i thought—i thought it was the master—it looked like ’im.”\\n\\ni saw mrs. maltravers give a terrified start, and my mind flew to\\nthe old superstition that a suicide cannot rest. she thought of it\\ntoo, i am sure, for a minute later, she caught poirot’s arm with\\na scream.\\n\\n“didn’t you hear that? those three taps on the window? that’s how\\n_he_ always used to tap when he passed round the house.”\\n\\n“the ivy,” i cried. “it was the ivy against the pane.”\\n\\nbut a sort of terror was gaining on us all. the parlourmaid was\\nobviously unstrung, and when the meal was over mrs. maltravers\\nbesought poirot not to go at once. she was clearly terrified to be\\nleft alone. we sat in the little morning-room. the wind was getting\\nup, and moaning round the house in an eerie fashion. twice the door\\nof the room came unlatched and the door slowly opened, and each\\ntime she clung to me with a terrified gasp.\\n\\n“ah, but this door, it is bewitched!” cried\\n\\npoirot angrily at last. he got up and shut it once more, then\\nturned the key in the lock. “i shall lock it, so!”\\n\\n“don’t do that,” she gasped, “if it should come open now——”\\n\\nand even as she spoke the impossible happened. the locked door\\nslowly swung open. i could not see into the passage from where i\\nsat, but she and poirot were facing it. she gave one long shriek\\nas she turned to him.\\n\\n“you saw him—there in the passage?” she cried.\\n\\nhe was staring down at her with a puzzled face, then shook his\\nhead.\\n\\n“i saw him—my husband—you must have seen him too?”\\n\\n“madame, i saw nothing. you are not well—unstrung——”\\n\\n“i am perfectly well, i——oh, god!”\\n\\nsuddenly, without any warning, the lights quivered and went out.\\nout of the darkness came three loud raps. i could hear mrs.\\nmaltravers moaning.\\n\\nand then—i saw!\\n\\nthe man i had seen on the bed upstairs stood there facing us,\\ngleaming with a faint ghostly light. there was blood on his lips,\\nand he held his right hand out, pointing. suddenly a brilliant\\nlight seemed to proceed from it. it passed over poirot and me, and\\nfell on mrs. maltravers. i saw her white terrified face, and\\nsomething else!\\n\\n“my god, poirot!” i cried. “look at her hand, her right hand. it’s\\nall red!”\\n\\nher own eyes fell on it, and she collapsed in a heap on the floor.\\n\\n“blood,” she cried hysterically. “yes, it’s blood. i killed him.\\ni did it. he was showing me, and then i put my hand on the trigger\\nand pressed. save me from him—save me! he’s come back!”\\n\\nher voice died away in a gurgle.\\n\\n“lights,” said poirot briskly.\\n\\nthe lights went on as if by magic.\\n\\n“that’s it,” he continued. “you heard, hastings? and you, everett?\\noh, by the way, this is mr. everett, rather a fine member of the\\ntheatrical profession. i ’phoned to him this afternoon. his make-up\\nis good, isn’t it? quite like the dead man, and with a pocket torch\\nand the necessary phosphorescence he made the proper impression.\\ni shouldn’t touch her right hand if i were you, hastings. red paint\\nmarks so. when the lights went out i clasped her hand, you see. by\\nthe way, we mustn’t miss our train. inspector japp is outside the\\nwindow. a bad night—but he has been able to while away the time by\\ntapping on the window every now and then.”\\n\\n“you see,” continued poirot, as we walked briskly through the wind\\nand rain, “there was a little discrepancy. the doctor seemed to\\nthink the deceased was a christian scientist, and who could have\\ngiven him that impression but mrs. maltravers? but to us she\\nrepresented him as being in a grave state of apprehension about\\nhis own health. again, why was she so taken aback by the reappearance\\nof young black? and lastly, although i know that convention decrees\\nthat a woman must make a decent pretence of mourning for her\\nhusband, i do not care for such heavily-rouged eyelids! you did\\nnot observe them, hastings? no? as i always tell you, you see\\nnothing!”\\n\\n“well, there it was. there were the two possibilities. did black’s\\nstory suggest an ingenious method of committing suicide to mr.\\nmaltravers, or did his other listener, the wife, see an equally\\ningenious method of committing murder? i inclined to the latter\\nview. to shoot himself in the way indicated, he would probably have\\nhad to pull the trigger with his toe—or at least so i imagine.\\nnow if maltravers had been found with one boot off, we should\\nalmost certainly have heard of it from some one. an odd detail like\\nthat would have been remembered.\\n\\n“no, as i say, i inclined to the view that it was a case of murder,\\nnot suicide, but i realized that i had not a shadow of proof in\\nsupport of my theory. hence the elaborate little comedy you saw\\nplayed to-night.”\\n\\n“even now i don’t quite see all the details of the crime?” i said.\\n\\n“let us start from the beginning. here is a shrewd and scheming\\nwoman who, knowing of her husband’s financial _débâcle_ and tired\\nof the elderly mate she has only married for his money, induces\\nhim to insure his life for a large sum, and then seeks for the\\nmeans to accomplish her purpose. an accident gives her that—the\\nyoung soldier’s strange story. the next afternoon when _monsieur\\nle capitaine_, as she thinks, is on the high seas, she and her\\nhusband are strolling round the grounds. ‘what a curious story that\\nwas last night!’ she observes. ‘could a man shoot himself in such\\na way? do show me if it is possible!’ the poor fool—he shows her.\\nhe places the end of the rifle in his mouth. she stoops down, and\\nputs her finger on the trigger, laughing up at him. ‘and now, sir,’\\nshe says saucily, ‘supposing i pull the trigger?’\\n\\n“and then—and then, hastings—she pulls it!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  iii\\n\\n\\n  the adventure of the cheap flat\\n\\n\\nso far, in the cases which i have recorded, poirot’s investigations\\nhave started from the central fact, whether murder or robbery, and\\nhave proceeded from thence by a process of logical deduction to\\nthe final triumphant unravelling. in the events i am now about to\\nchronicle, a remarkable chain of circumstances led from the\\napparently trivial incidents which first attracted poirot’s\\nattention to the sinister happenings which completed a most unusual\\ncase.\\n\\ni had been spending the evening with an old friend of mine, gerald\\nparker. there had been, perhaps, about half a dozen people there\\nbesides my host and myself, and the talk fell, as it was bound to\\ndo sooner or later wherever parker found himself, on the subject\\nof house-hunting in london. houses and flats were parker’s special\\nhobby. since the end of the war, he had occupied at least half a\\ndozen different flats and maisonnettes. no sooner was he settled\\nanywhere than he would light unexpectedly upon a new find, and\\nwould forthwith depart bag and baggage. his moves were nearly\\nalways accomplished at a slight pecuniary gain, for he had a shrewd\\nbusiness head, but it was sheer love of the sport that actuated\\nhim, and not a desire to make money at it. we listened to parker\\nfor some time with the respect of the novice for the expert. then\\nit was our turn, and a perfect babel of tongues was let loose.\\nfinally the floor was left to mrs. robinson, a charming little\\nbride who was there with her husband. i had never met them before,\\nas robinson was only a recent acquaintance of parker’s.\\n\\n“talking of flats,” she said, “have you heard of our piece of luck,\\nmr. parker? we’ve got a flat—at last! in montagu mansions.”\\n\\n“well,” said parker, “i’ve always said there are plenty of flats—at\\na price!”\\n\\n“yes, but this isn’t at a price. it’s dirt cheap. eighty pounds a\\nyear!”\\n\\n“but—but montagu mansions is just off knightsbridge, isn’t it? big\\nhandsome building. or are you talking of a poor relation of the\\nsame name stuck in the slums somewhere?”\\n\\n“no, it’s the knightsbridge one. that’s what makes it so wonderful.”\\n\\n“wonderful is the word! it’s a blinking miracle. but there must be\\na catch somewhere. big premium, i suppose?”\\n\\n“no premium!”\\n\\n“no prem—oh, hold my head, somebody!” groaned parker.\\n\\n“but we’ve got to buy the furniture,” continued mrs. robinson.\\n\\n“ah!” parker brisked up. “i knew there was a catch!”\\n\\n“for fifty pounds. and it’s beautifully furnished!”\\n\\n“i give it up,” said parker. “the present occupants must be lunatics\\nwith a taste for philanthropy.”\\n\\nmrs. robinson was looking a little troubled. a little pucker\\nappeared between her dainty brows.\\n\\n“it _is_ queer, isn’t it? you don’t think that—that—the place is\\n_haunted_?”\\n\\n“never heard of a haunted flat,” declared parker decisively.\\n\\n“n-o.” mrs. robinson appeared far from convinced. “but there were\\nseveral things about it all that struck me as—well, queer.”\\n\\n“for instance——” i suggested.\\n\\n“ah,” said parker, “our criminal expert’s attention is aroused!\\nunburden yourself to him, mrs. robinson. hastings is a great\\nunraveller of mysteries.”\\n\\ni laughed, embarrassed but not wholly displeased with the rôle\\nthrust upon me.\\n\\n“oh, not really queer, captain hastings, but when we went to the\\nagents, stosser and paul—we hadn’t tried them before because they\\nonly have the expensive mayfair flats, but we thought at any rate\\nit would do no harm—everything they offered us was four and five\\nhundred a year, or else huge premiums, and then, just as we were\\ngoing, they mentioned that they had a flat at eighty, but that they\\ndoubted if it would be any good our going there, because it had\\nbeen on their books some time and they had sent so many people to\\nsee it that it was almost sure to be taken—‘snapped up’ as the\\nclerk put it—only people were so tiresome in not letting them know,\\nand then they went on sending, and people get annoyed at being sent\\nto a place that had, perhaps, been let some time.”\\n\\nmrs. robinson paused for some much needed breath, and then\\ncontinued: “we thanked him, and said that we quite\\nunderstood it would probably be no good, but that we should\\nlike an order all the same—just in case. and we went there\\nstraight away in a taxi, for, after all, you never know. no.\\n4 was on the second floor, and just as we were waiting for\\nthe lift, elsie ferguson—she’s a friend of mine, captain\\nhastings, and they are looking for a flat too—came hurrying\\ndown the stairs. ‘ahead of you for once, my dear,’ she said.\\n‘but it’s no good. it’s already let.’ that seemed to finish\\nit, but—well, as john said, the place was very cheap, we\\ncould afford to give more, and perhaps if we offered a\\npremium.——a horrid thing to do, of course, and i feel quite\\nashamed of telling you, but you know what flat-hunting is.”\\n\\ni assured her that i was well aware that in the struggle for\\nhouse-room the baser side of human nature frequently triumphed over\\nthe higher, and that the well-known rule of dog eat dog always\\napplied.\\n\\n“so we went up and, would you believe it, the flat wasn’t let at\\nall. we were shown over it by the maid, and then we saw the\\nmistress, and the thing was settled then and there. immediate\\npossession and fifty pounds for the furniture. we signed the\\nagreement next day, and we are to move in to-morrow!” mrs. robinson\\npaused triumphantly.\\n\\n“and what about mrs. ferguson?” asked parker. “let’s have your\\ndeductions, hastings.”\\n\\n“‘obvious, my dear watson,’” i quoted lightly. “she went to the\\nwrong flat.”\\n\\n“oh, captain hastings, how clever of you!” cried mrs. robinson\\nadmiringly.\\n\\ni rather wished poirot had been there. sometimes i have the feeling\\nthat he rather underestimates my capabilities.\\n\\n\\n  •   •   •   •   •   •   •\\n\\n\\nthe whole thing was rather amusing, and i propounded the thing as\\na mock problem to poirot on the following morning. he seemed\\ninterested, and questioned me rather narrowly as to the rents of\\nflats in various localities.\\n\\n“a curious story,” he said thoughtfully. “excuse me, hastings, i\\nmust take a short stroll.”\\n\\nwhen he returned, about an hour later, his eyes were gleaming with\\na peculiar excitement. he laid his stick on the table, and brushed\\nthe nap of his hat with his usual tender care before he spoke.\\n\\n“it is as well, _mon ami_, that we have no affairs of moment on\\nhand. we can devote ourselves wholly to the present investigation.”\\n\\n“what investigation are you talking about?”\\n\\n“the remarkable cheapness of your friend’s, mrs. robinson’s, new\\nflat.”\\n\\n“poirot, you are not serious!”\\n\\n“i am most serious. figure to yourself, my friend, that the real\\nrent of those flats is £350. i have just ascertained that from the\\nlandlord’s agents. and yet this particular flat is being sublet at\\neighty pounds! why?”\\n\\n“there must be something wrong with it. perhaps it is haunted, as\\nmrs. robinson suggested.”\\n\\npoirot shook his head in a dissatisfied manner.\\n\\n“then again how curious it is that her friend tells her the flat\\nis let, and, when she goes up, behold, it is not so at all!”\\n\\n“but surely you agree with me that the other woman must have gone\\nto the wrong flat. that is the only possible solution.”\\n\\n“you may or may not be right on that point, hastings. the fact\\nstill remains that numerous other applicants were sent to see it,\\nand yet, in spite of its remarkable cheapness, it was still in the\\nmarket when mrs. robinson arrived.”\\n\\n“that shows that there must be something wrong about it.”\\n\\n“mrs. robinson did not seem to notice anything amiss. very curious,\\nis it not? did she impress you as being a truthful woman, hastings?”\\n\\n“she was a delightful creature!”\\n\\n“_évidemment!_ since she renders you incapable of replying to my\\nquestion. describe her to me, then.”\\n\\n“well, she’s tall and fair; her hair’s really a beautiful shade of\\nauburn——”\\n\\n“always you have had a penchant for auburn hair!” murmured poirot.\\n“but continue.”\\n\\n“blue eyes and a very nice complexion and—well, that’s all, i\\nthink,” i concluded lamely.\\n\\n“and her husband?”\\n\\n“oh, he’s quite a nice fellow—nothing startling.”\\n\\n“dark or fair?”\\n\\n“i don’t know—betwixt and between, and just an ordinary sort of\\nface.”\\n\\npoirot nodded.\\n\\n“yes, there are hundreds of these average men—and, anyway, you\\nbring more sympathy and appreciation to your description of women.\\ndo you know anything about these people? does parker know them\\nwell.”\\n\\n“they are just recent acquaintances, i believe. but surely, poirot,\\nyou don’t think for an instant——”\\n\\npoirot raised his hand.\\n\\n“_tout doucement, mon ami_. have i said that i think anything? all\\ni say is—it is a curious story. and there is nothing to throw light\\nupon it; except perhaps the lady’s name, eh, hastings?”\\n\\n“her name is stella,” i said stiffly, “but i don’t see——”\\n\\npoirot interrupted me with a tremendous chuckle. something seemed\\nto be amusing him vastly.\\n\\n“and stella means a star, does it not? famous!”\\n\\n“what on earth——”\\n\\n“and stars give light! _voilà!_ calm yourself, hastings. do not\\nput on that air of injured dignity. come, we will go to montagu\\nmansions and make a few inquiries.”\\n\\ni accompanied him, nothing loath. the mansions were a handsome\\nblock of buildings in excellent repair. a uniformed porter was\\nsunning himself on the threshold, and it was to him that poirot\\naddressed himself:\\n\\n“pardon, but could you tell me if a mr. and mrs. robinson reside\\nhere?”\\n\\nthe porter was a man of few words and apparently of a sour or\\nsuspicious disposition. he hardly looked at us and grunted out:\\n\\n“no. 4. second floor.”\\n\\n“i thank you. can you tell me how long they have been here?”\\n\\n“six months.”\\n\\ni started forward in amazement, conscious as i did so of poirot’s\\nmalicious grin.\\n\\n“impossible,” i cried. “you must be making a mistake.”\\n\\n“six months.”\\n\\n“are you sure? the lady i mean is tall and fair with reddish gold\\nhair and——”\\n\\n“that’s ’er,” said the porter. “come in the michaelmas quarter,\\nthey did. just six months ago.”\\n\\nhe appeared to lose interest in us and retreated slowly up the\\nhall. i followed poirot outside.\\n\\n“_eh bien_, hastings?” my friend demanded slyly. “are you so sure\\nnow that delightful women always speak the truth?”\\n\\ni did not reply.\\n\\npoirot had steered his way into brompton road before i asked him\\nwhat he was going to do and where we were going.\\n\\n“to the house agents, hastings. i have a great desire to have a\\nflat in montagu mansions. if i am not mistaken, several interesting\\nthings will take place there before long.”\\n\\nwe were fortunate in our quest. no. 8, on the fourth floor, was to\\nbe let furnished at ten guineas a week. poirot promptly took it\\nfor a month. outside in the street again, he silenced my protests:\\n\\n“but i make money nowadays! why should i not indulge a whim? by\\nthe way, hastings, have you a revolver?”\\n\\n“yes—somewhere,” i answered, slightly thrilled. “do you think——”\\n\\n“that you will need it? it is quite possible. the idea pleases you,\\ni see. always the spectacular and romantic appeals to you.”\\n\\nthe following day saw us installed in our temporary home. the flat\\nwas pleasantly furnished. it occupied the same position in the\\nbuilding as that of the robinsons, but was two floors higher.\\n\\nthe day after our installation was a sunday. in the afternoon,\\npoirot left the front door ajar, and summoned me hastily as a bang\\nreverberated from somewhere below.\\n\\n“look over the banisters. are those your friends. do not let them\\nsee you.”\\n\\ni craned my neck over the staircase.\\n\\n“that’s them,” i declared in an ungrammatical whisper.\\n\\n“good. wait awhile.”\\n\\nabout half an hour later, a young woman emerged in brilliant and\\nvaried clothing. with a sigh of satisfaction, poirot tiptoed back\\ninto the flat.\\n\\n“_c’est ça_. after the master and mistress, the maid. the flat\\nshould now be empty.”\\n\\n“what are we going to do?” i asked uneasily.\\n\\npoirot had trotted briskly into the scullery and was hauling at\\nthe rope of the coal-lift.\\n\\n“we are about to descend after the method of the dustbins,” he\\nexplained cheerfully. “no one will observe us. the sunday concert,\\nthe sunday ‘afternoon out,’ and finally the sunday nap after the\\nsunday dinner of england—_le rosbif_—all these will distract\\nattention from the doings of hercule poirot. come, my friend.”\\n\\nhe stepped into the rough wooden contrivance and i followed him\\ngingerly.\\n\\n“are we going to break into the flat?” i asked dubiously.\\n\\npoirot’s answer was not too reassuring:\\n\\n“not precisely to-day,” he replied.\\n\\npulling on the rope, we descended slowly till we reached the second\\nfloor. poirot uttered an exclamation of satisfaction as he perceived\\nthat the wooden door into the scullery was open.\\n\\n“you observe? never do they bolt these doors in the daytime. and\\nyet anyone could mount or descend as we have done. at night\\nyes—though not always then—and it is against that that we are going\\nto make provision.”\\n\\nhe had drawn some tools from his pocket as he spoke, and at once\\nset deftly to work, his object being to arrange the bolt so that\\nit could be pulled back from the lift. the operation only occupied\\nabout three minutes. then poirot returned the tools to his pocket,\\nand we reascended once more to our own domain.\\n\\n\\n  •   •   •   •   •   •   •\\n\\n\\non monday poirot was out all day, but when he returned in the\\nevening he flung himself into his chair with a sigh of satisfaction.\\n\\n“hastings, shall i recount to you a little history? a story after\\nyour own heart and which will remind you of your favourite cinema?”\\n\\n“go ahead,” i laughed. “i presume that it is a true story, not one\\nof your efforts of fancy.”\\n\\n“it is true enough. inspector japp of scotland yard will vouch for\\nits accuracy, since it was through his kind offices that it came\\nto my ears. listen, hastings. a little over six months ago some\\nimportant naval plans were stolen from an american government\\ndepartment. they showed the position of some of the most important\\nharbour defences, and would be worth a considerable sum to any\\nforeign government—that of japan, for example. suspicion fell upon\\na young man named luigi valdarno, an italian by birth, who was\\nemployed in a minor capacity in the department and who was missing\\nat the same time as the papers. whether luigi valdarno was the\\nthief or not, he was found two days later on the east side in new\\nyork, shot dead. the papers were not on him. now for some time past\\nluigi valdarno had been going about with a miss elsa hardt, a young\\nconcert singer who had recently appeared and who lived with a\\nbrother in an apartment in washington. nothing was known of the\\nantecedents of miss elsa hardt, and she disappeared suddenly about\\nthe time of valdarno’s death. there are reasons for believing that\\nshe was in reality an accomplished international spy who has done\\nmuch nefarious work under various _aliases_. the american secret\\nservice, whilst doing their best to trace her, also kept an eye\\nupon certain insignificant japanese gentlemen living in washington.\\nthey felt pretty certain that, when elsa hardt had covered her\\ntracks sufficiently, she would approach the gentlemen in question.\\none of them left suddenly for england a fortnight ago. on the face\\nof it, therefore, it would seem that elsa hardt is in england.”\\npoirot paused, and then added softly: “the official description of\\nelsa hardt is: height 5 ft. 7, eyes blue, hair auburn, fair\\ncomplexion, nose straight, no special distinguishing marks.”\\n\\n“mrs. robinson!” i gasped.\\n\\n“well, there is a chance of it, anyhow,” amended poirot. “also, i\\nlearn that a swarthy man, a foreigner of some kind, was inquiring\\nabout the occupants of no. 4 only this morning. therefore, _mon\\nami_, i fear that you must forswear your beauty sleep to-night,\\nand join me in my all-night vigil in the flat below—armed with that\\nexcellent revolver of yours, _bien entendu_!”\\n\\n“rather,” i cried with enthusiasm. “when shall we start?”\\n\\n“the hour of midnight is both solemn and suitable, i fancy. nothing\\nis likely to occur before then.”\\n\\nat twelve o’clock precisely, we crept cautiously into the coal-lift\\nand lowered ourselves to the second floor. under poirot’s\\nmanipulation, the wooden door quickly swung inwards, and we climbed\\ninto the flat. from the scullery we passed into the kitchen where\\nwe established ourselves comfortably in two chairs with the door\\ninto the hall ajar.\\n\\n“now we have but to wait,” said poirot contentedly, closing his\\neyes.\\n\\nto me, the waiting appeared endless. i was terrified of going to\\nsleep. just when it seemed to me that i had been there about eight\\nhours—and had, as i found out afterwards, in reality been exactly\\none hour and twenty minutes—a faint scratching sound came to my\\nears. poirot’s hand touched mine. i rose, and together we moved\\ncarefully in the direction of the hall. the noise came from there.\\npoirot placed his lips to my ear.\\n\\n“outside the front door. they are cutting out the lock. when i give\\nthe word, not before, fall upon him from behind and hold him fast.\\nbe careful, he will have a knife.”\\n\\npresently there was a rending sound, and a little circle of light\\nappeared through the door. it was extinguished immediately and then\\nthe door was slowly opened. poirot and i flattened ourselves\\nagainst the wall. i heard a man’s breathing as he passed us. then\\nhe flashed on his torch, and as he did so, poirot hissed in my ear:\\n\\n“_allez_.”\\n\\nwe sprang together, poirot with a quick movement enveloped the\\nintruder’s head with a light woollen scarf whilst i pinioned his\\narms. the whole affair was quick and noiseless. i twisted a dagger\\nfrom his hand, and as poirot brought down the scarf from his eyes,\\nwhilst keeping it wound tightly round his mouth, i jerked up my\\nrevolver where he could see it and understand that resistance was\\nuseless. as he ceased to struggle poirot put his mouth close to\\nhis ear and began to whisper rapidly. after a minute the man\\nnodded. then enjoining silence with a movement of the hand, poirot\\nled the way out of the flat and down the stairs. our captive\\nfollowed, and i brought up the rear with the revolver. when we were\\nout in the street, poirot turned to me.\\n\\n“there is a taxi waiting just round the corner. give me the\\nrevolver. we shall not need it now.”\\n\\n“but if this fellow tries to escape?”\\n\\npoirot smiled.\\n\\n“he will not.”\\n\\ni returned in a minute with the waiting taxi. the scarf had been\\nunwound from the stranger’s face, and i gave a start of surprise.\\n\\n“he’s not a jap,” i ejaculated in a whisper to poirot.\\n\\n“observation was always your strong point, hastings! nothing\\nescapes you. no, the man is not a jap. he is an italian.”\\n\\nwe got into the taxi, and poirot gave the driver an address in st.\\njohn’s wood. i was by now completely fogged. i did not like to ask\\npoirot where we were going in front of our captive, and strove in\\nvain to obtain some light upon the proceedings.\\n\\nwe alighted at the door of a small house standing back from the\\nroad. a returning wayfarer, slightly drunk, was lurching along the\\npavement and almost collided with poirot, who said something\\nsharply to him which i did not catch. all three of us went up the\\nsteps of the house. poirot rang the bell and motioned us to stand\\na little aside. there was no answer and he rang again and then\\nseized the knocker which he plied for some minutes vigorously.\\n\\na light appeared suddenly above the fanlight, and the door was\\nopened cautiously a little way.\\n\\n“what the devil do you want?” a man’s voice demanded harshly.\\n\\n“i want the doctor. my wife is taken ill.”\\n\\n“there’s no doctor here.”\\n\\nthe man prepared to shut the door, but poirot thrust his foot in\\nadroitly. he became suddenly a perfect caricature of an infuriated\\nfrenchman.\\n\\n“what you say, there is no doctor? i will have the law of you. you\\nmust come! i will stay here and ring and knock all night.”\\n\\n“my dear sir——” the door was opened again, the man, clad in a\\ndressing-gown and slippers, stepped forward to pacify poirot with\\nan uneasy glance round.\\n\\n“i will call the police.”\\n\\npoirot prepared to descend the steps.\\n\\n“no, don’t do that for heaven’s sake!” the man dashed after him.\\n\\nwith a neat push poirot sent him staggering down the steps. in\\nanother minute all three of us were inside the door and it was\\npushed to and bolted.\\n\\n“quick—in here.” poirot led the way into the nearest room switching\\non the light as he did so. “and you—behind the curtain.”\\n\\n“si, signor,” said the italian and slid rapidly behind the full\\nfolds of rose-coloured velvet which draped the embrasure of the\\nwindow.\\n\\nnot a minute too soon. just as he disappeared from view a woman\\nrushed into the room. she was tall with reddish hair and held a\\nscarlet kimono round her slender form.\\n\\n“where is my husband?” she cried, with a quick frightened glance.\\n“who are you?”\\n\\npoirot stepped forward with a bow.\\n\\n“it is to be hoped your husband will not suffer from a chill. i\\nobserved that he had slippers on his feet, and that his dressing-gown\\nwas a warm one.”\\n\\n“who are you? what are you doing in my house?”\\n\\n“it is true that none of us have the pleasure of your acquaintance,\\nmadame. it is especially to be regretted as one of our number has\\ncome specially from new york in order to meet you.”\\n\\nthe curtains parted and the italian stepped out. to my horror i\\nobserved that he was brandishing my revolver, which poirot must\\ndoubtless have put down through inadvertence in the cab.\\n\\nthe woman gave a piercing scream and turned to fly, but poirot was\\nstanding in front of the closed door.\\n\\n“let me by,” she shrieked. “he will murder me.”\\n\\n“who was it dat croaked luigi valdarno?” asked the italian hoarsely,\\nbrandishing the weapon, and sweeping each one of us with it. we\\ndared not move.\\n\\n“my god, poirot, this is awful. what shall we do?” i cried.\\n\\n“you will oblige me by refraining from talking so much, hastings.\\ni can assure you that our friend will not shoot until i give the\\nword.”\\n\\n“youse sure o’ dat, eh?” said the italian, leering unpleasantly.\\n\\nit was more than i was, but the woman turned to poirot like a\\nflash.\\n\\n“what is it you want?”\\n\\npoirot bowed.\\n\\n“i do not think it is necessary to insult miss elsa hardt’s\\nintelligence by telling her.”\\n\\nwith a swift movement, the woman snatched up a big black velvet\\ncat which served as a cover for the telephone.\\n\\n“they are stitched in the lining of that.”\\n\\n“clever,” murmured poirot appreciatively. he stood aside from the\\ndoor. “good evening, madame. i will detain your friend from new\\nyork whilst you make your getaway.”\\n\\n“whatta fool!” roared the big italian, and raising the revolver he\\nfired point-blank at the woman’s retreating figure just as i flung\\nmyself upon him.\\n\\nbut the weapon merely clicked harmlessly and poirot’s voice rose\\nin mild reproof.\\n\\n“never will you trust your old friend, hastings. i do not care for\\nmy friends to carry loaded pistols about with them and never would\\ni permit a mere acquaintance to do so. no, no, _mon ami_.” this to\\nthe italian who swearing hoarsely. poirot continued to address him\\nin a tone of mild reproof: “see now, what i have done for you. i\\nhave saved you from being hanged. and do not think that our\\nbeautiful lady will escape. no, no, the house is watched, back and\\nfront. straight into the arms of the police they will go. is not\\nthat a beautiful and consoling thought? yes, you may leave the room\\nnow. but be careful—be very careful. i——ah, he is gone! and my\\nfriend hastings looks at me with eyes of reproach. but it was all\\nso simple! it was clear, from the first, that out of several\\nhundred, probably, applicants for no. 4, montagu mansions only the\\nrobinsons were considered suitable. why? what was there that\\nsingled them out from the rest—at practically a glance. their\\nappearance? possibly, but it was not so unusual. their name, then!”\\n\\n“but there’s nothing unusual about the name of robinson,” i cried.\\n“it’s quite a common name.”\\n\\n“ah! _sapristi_, but exactly! that was the point. elsa hardt and\\nher husband, or brother or whatever he really is, come from new\\nyork, and take a flat in the name of mr. and mrs. robinson. suddenly\\nthey learn that one of these secret societies, the mafia, or the\\ncamorra, to which doubtless luigi valdarno belonged, is on their\\ntrack. what do they do? they hit on a scheme of transparent\\nsimplicity. evidently they knew that their pursuers were not\\npersonally acquainted with either of them. what then can be simpler?\\nthey offer the flat at an absurdly low rental. of the thousands of\\nyoung couples in london looking for flats, there cannot fail to be\\nseveral robinsons. it is only a matter of waiting. if you will look\\nat the name of robinson in the telephone directory, you will\\nrealize that a fair-haired mrs. robinson was pretty sure to come\\nalong sooner or later. then what will happen? the avenger arrives.\\nhe knows the name, he knows the address. he strikes! all is over,\\nvengeance is satisfied, and miss elsa hardt has escaped by the skin\\nof her teeth once more. by the way, hastings, you must present me\\nto the real mrs. robinson—that delightful and truthful creature!\\nwhat will they think when they find their flat has been broken\\ninto! we must hurry back. ah, that sounds like japp and his friends\\narriving.”\\n\\na mighty tattoo sounded on the knocker.\\n\\n“how did you know this address?” i asked as i followed poirot out\\ninto the hall. “oh, of course, you had the first mrs. robinson\\nfollowed when she left the other flat.”\\n\\n“_a la bonne heure_, hastings. you use your grey cells at last.\\nnow for a little surprise for japp.”\\n\\nsoftly unbolting the door, he stuck the cat’s head round the edge\\nand ejaculated a piercing “miaow.”\\n\\nthe scotland yard inspector, who was standing outside with another\\nman, jumped in spite of himself.\\n\\n“oh, it’s only monsieur poirot at one of his little jokes!” he\\nexclaimed, as poirot’s head followed that of the cat. “let us in,\\nmoosior.”\\n\\n“you have our friends safe and sound?”\\n\\n“yes, we’ve got the birds all right. but they hadn’t got the goods\\nwith them.”\\n\\n“i see. so you come to search. well, i am about to depart with\\nhastings, but i should like to give you a little lecture upon the\\nhistory and habits of the domestic cat.”\\n\\n“for the lord’s sake, have you gone completely balmy?”\\n\\n“the cat,” declaimed poirot, “was worshipped by the ancient\\negyptians. it is still regarded as a symbol of good luck if a black\\ncat crosses your path. this cat crossed your path to-night, japp.\\nto speak of the interior of any animal or any person is not, i\\nknow, considered polite in england. but the interior of this cat\\nis perfectly delicate. i refer to the lining.”\\n\\nwith a sudden grunt, the second man seized the cat from poirot’s\\nhand.\\n\\n“oh, i forgot to introduce you,” said japp. “mr. poirot, this is\\nmr. burt of the united states secret service.”\\n\\nthe american’s trained fingers had felt what he was looking for.\\nhe held out his hand, and for a moment speech failed him. then he\\nrose to the occasion.\\n\\n“pleased to meet you,” said mr. burt.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  iv\\n\\n\\n  the mystery of hunter’s lodge\\n\\n\\n“after all,” murmured poirot, “it is possible that i shall not die\\nthis time.”\\n\\ncoming from a convalescent influenza patient, i hailed the remark\\nas showing a beneficial optimism. i myself had been the first\\nsufferer from the disease. poirot in his turn had gone down. he\\nwas now sitting up in bed, propped up with pillows, his head\\nmuffled in a woollen shawl, and was slowly sipping a particularly\\nnoxious tisane which i had prepared according to his directions.\\nhis eye rested with pleasure upon a neatly graduated row of medicine\\nbottles which adorned the mantelpiece.\\n\\n“yes, yes,” my little friend continued. “once more shall i be\\nmyself again, the great hercule poirot, the terror of evil-doers!\\nfigure to yourself, _mon ami_, that i have a little paragraph to\\nmyself in _society gossip_. but yes! here it is! ‘go it—criminals—all\\nout! hercule poirot—and believe me, girls, he’s some hercules!—our\\nown pet society detective can’t get a grip on you. ’cause why?\\n’cause he’s got _la grippe_ himself’!”\\n\\ni laughed.\\n\\n“good for you, poirot. you are becoming quite a public character.\\nand fortunately you haven’t missed anything of particular interest\\nduring this time.”\\n\\n“that is true. the few cases i have had to decline did not fill me\\nwith any regret.”\\n\\nour landlady stuck her head in at the door.\\n\\n“there’s a gentleman downstairs. says he must see monsieur poirot\\nor you, captain. seeing as he was in a great to-do—and with all\\nthat quite the gentleman—i brought up ’is card.”\\n\\nshe handed me the bit of pasteboard. “mr. roger havering,” i read.\\n\\npoirot motioned with his head towards the bookcase, and i obediently\\npulled forth “who’s who.” poirot took it from me and scanned the\\npages rapidly.\\n\\n“second son of fifth baron windsor. married 1913 zoe, fourth\\ndaughter of william crabb.”\\n\\n“h’m!” i said. “i rather fancy that’s the girl who used to act at\\nthe frivolity—only she called herself zoe carrisbrook. i remember\\nshe married some young man about town just before the war.”\\n\\n“would it interest you, hastings, to go down and hear what our\\nvisitor’s particular little trouble is? make him all my excuses.”\\n\\nroger havering was a man of about forty, well set up and of smart\\nappearance. his face, however, was haggard, and he was evidently\\nlabouring under great agitation.\\n\\n“captain hastings? you are monsieur poirot’s partner, i understand.\\nit is imperative that he should come with me to derbyshire to-day.”\\n\\n“i’m afraid that’s impossible,” i replied. “poirot is ill in\\nbed—influenza.”\\n\\nhis face fell.\\n\\n“dear me, that is a great blow to me.”\\n\\n“the matter on which you want to consult him is serious?”\\n\\n“my god, yes! my uncle, the best friend i have in the world, was\\nfoully murdered last night.”\\n\\n“here in london?”\\n\\n“no, in derbyshire. i was in town and received a telegram from my\\nwife this morning. immediately upon its receipt i determined to\\ncome round and beg monsieur poirot to undertake the case.”\\n\\n“if you will excuse me a minute,” i said, struck by a sudden idea.\\n\\ni rushed upstairs, and in a few brief words acquainted poirot with\\nthe situation. he took any further words out of my mouth.\\n\\n“i see. i see. you want to go yourself, is it not so? well, why\\nnot? you should know my methods by now. all i ask is that you\\nshould report to me fully every day, and follow implicitly any\\ninstructions i may wire you.”\\n\\nto this i willingly agreed.\\n\\n\\n  •   •   •   •   •   •   •\\n\\n\\nan hour later i was sitting opposite mr. havering in a first-class\\ncarriage on the midland railway, speeding rapidly away from london.\\n\\n“to begin with, captain hastings, you must understand that hunter’s\\nlodge, where we are going, and where the tragedy took place, is\\nonly a small shooting-box in the heart of the derbyshire moors.\\nour real home is near newmarket, and we usually rent a flat in town\\nfor the season. hunter’s lodge is looked after by a housekeeper\\nwho is quite capable of doing all we need when we run down for an\\noccasional week-end. of course, during the shooting season, we take\\ndown some of our own servants from newmarket. my uncle, mr.\\nharrington pace (as you may know, my mother was a miss pace of new\\nyork), has, for the last three years, made his home with us. he\\nnever got on well with my father, or my elder brother, and i\\nsuspect that my being somewhat of a prodigal son myself rather\\nincreased than diminished his affection towards me. of course i am\\na poor man, and my uncle was a rich one—in other words, he paid\\nthe piper! but, though exacting in many ways, he was not really\\nhard to get on with, and we all three lived very harmoniously\\ntogether. two days ago my uncle, rather wearied with some recent\\ngaieties of ours in town, suggested that we should run down to\\nderbyshire for a day or two. my wife telegraphed to mrs. middleton,\\nthe housekeeper, and we went down that same afternoon. yesterday\\nevening i was forced to return to town, but my wife and my uncle\\nremained on. this morning i received this telegram.” he handed it\\nover to me:\\n\\n“come at once uncle harrington murdered last night bring good\\ndetective if you can but do come—zoe.”\\n\\n“then, as yet you know no details?”\\n\\n“no, i suppose it will be in the evening papers. without doubt the\\npolice are in charge.”\\n\\nit was about three o’clock when we arrived at the little station\\nof elmer’s dale. from there a five-mile drive brought us to a small\\ngrey stone building in the midst of the rugged moors.\\n\\n“a lonely place,” i observed with a shiver.\\n\\nhavering nodded.\\n\\n“i shall try and get rid of it. i could never live here again.”\\n\\nwe unlatched the gate and were walking up the narrow path to the\\noak door when a familiar figure emerged and came to meet us.\\n\\n“japp!” i ejaculated.\\n\\nthe scotland yard inspector grinned at me in a friendly fashion\\nbefore addressing my companion.\\n\\n“mr. havering, i think? i’ve been sent down from london to take\\ncharge of this case, and i’d like a word with you, if i may, sir.”\\n\\n“my wife——”\\n\\n“i’ve seen your good lady, sir—and the housekeeper. i won’t keep\\nyou a moment, but i’m anxious to get back to the village now that\\ni’ve seen all there is to see here.”\\n\\n“i know nothing as yet as to what——”\\n\\n“ex-actly,” said japp soothingly. “but there are just one or two\\nlittle points i’d like your opinion about all the same. captain\\nhastings here, he knows me, and he’ll go on up to the house and\\ntell them you’re coming. what have you done with the little man,\\nby the way, captain hastings?”\\n\\n“he’s ill in bed with influenza.”\\n\\n“is he now? i’m sorry to hear that. rather the case of the cart\\nwithout the horse, your being here without him, isn’t it?”\\n\\nand on his rather ill-timed jest i went on to the house. i rang\\nthe bell, as japp had closed the door behind him. after some\\nmoments it was opened to me by a middle-aged woman in black.\\n\\n“mr. havering will be here in a moment,” i explained. “he has been\\ndetained by the inspector. i have come down with him from london\\nto look into the case. perhaps you can tell me briefly what occurred\\nlast night.”\\n\\n“come inside, sir.” she closed the door behind me, and we stood in\\nthe dimly-lighted hall. “it was after dinner last night, sir, that\\nthe man came. he asked to see mr. pace, sir, and, seeing that he\\nspoke the same way, i thought it was an american gentleman friend\\nof mr. pace’s and i showed him into the gun-room, and then went to\\ntell mr. pace. he wouldn’t give any name, which, of course, was a\\nbit odd, now i come to think of it. i told mr. pace, and he seemed\\npuzzled like, but he said to the mistress: ‘excuse me, zoe, while\\ni just see what this fellow wants.’ he went off to the gun-room,\\nand i went back to the kitchen, but after a while i heard loud\\nvoices, as if they were quarrelling, and i came out into the hall.\\nat the same time, the mistress she comes out too, and just then\\nthere was a shot and then a dreadful silence. we both ran to the\\ngun-room door, but it was locked and we had to go round to the\\nwindow. it was open, and there inside was mr. pace, all shot and\\nbleeding.”\\n\\n“what became of the man?”\\n\\n“he must have got away through the window, sir, before we got to\\nit.”\\n\\n“and then?”\\n\\n“mrs. havering sent me to fetch the police. five miles to walk it\\nwas. they came back with me, and the constable he stayed all night,\\nand this morning the police gentleman from london arrived.”\\n\\n“what was this man like who called to see mr. pace?”\\n\\nthe housekeeper reflected.\\n\\n“he had a black beard, sir, and was about middle-aged, and had on\\na light overcoat. beyond the fact that he spoke like an american\\ni didn’t notice much about him.”\\n\\n“i see. now i wonder if i can see mrs. havering?”\\n\\n“she’s upstairs, sir. shall i tell her?”\\n\\n“if you please. tell her that mr. havering is outside with inspector\\njapp, and that the gentleman he has brought back with him from\\nlondon is anxious to speak to her as soon as possible.”\\n\\n“very good, sir.”\\n\\ni was in a fever of impatience to get at all the facts. japp had\\ntwo or three hours’ start of me, and his anxiety to be gone made\\nme keen to be close at his heels.\\n\\nmrs. havering did not keep me waiting long. in a few minutes i\\nheard a light step descending the stairs, and looked up to see a\\nvery handsome young woman coming towards me. she wore a\\nflame-coloured jumper, that set off the slender boyishness of her\\nfigure. on her dark head was a little hat of flame-coloured leather.\\neven the present tragedy could not dim the vitality of her\\npersonality.\\n\\ni introduced myself, and she nodded in quick comprehension.\\n\\n“of course i have often heard of you and your colleague, monsieur\\npoirot. you have done some wonderful things together, haven’t you?\\nit was very clever of my husband to get you so promptly. now will\\nyou ask me questions? that is the easiest way, isn’t it, of getting\\nto know all you want to about this dreadful affair?”\\n\\n“thank you, mrs. havering. now what time was it that this man\\narrived?”\\n\\n“it must have been just before nine o’clock. we had finished\\ndinner, and were sitting over our coffee and cigarettes.”\\n\\n“your husband had already left for london?”\\n\\n“yes, he went up by the 6.15.”\\n\\n“did he go by car to the station, or did he walk?”\\n\\n“our own car isn’t down here. one came out from the garage in\\nelmer’s dale to fetch him in time for the train.”\\n\\n“was mr. pace quite his usual self?”\\n\\n“absolutely. most normal in every way.”\\n\\n“now, can you describe this visitor at all?”\\n\\n“i’m afraid not. i didn’t see him. mrs. middleton showed him\\nstraight into the gun-room and then came to tell my uncle.”\\n\\n“what did your uncle say?”\\n\\n“he seemed rather annoyed, but went off at once. it was about five\\nminutes later that i heard the sound of raised voices. i ran out\\ninto the hall and almost collided with mrs. middleton. then we\\nheard the shot. the gun-room door was locked on the inside, and we\\nhad to go right round the house to the window. of course that took\\nsome time, and the murderer had been able to get well away. my poor\\nuncle”—her voice faltered—“had been shot through the head. i saw\\nat once that he was dead. i sent mrs. middleton for the police. i\\nwas careful to touch nothing in the room but to leave it exactly\\nas i found it.”\\n\\ni nodded approval.\\n\\n“now, as to the weapon?”\\n\\n“well, i can make a guess at it, captain hastings. a pair of\\nrevolvers of my husband’s were mounted upon the wall. one of them\\nis missing. i pointed this out to the police, and they took the\\nother one away with them. when they have extracted the bullet, i\\nsuppose they will know for certain.”\\n\\n“may i go to the gun-room?”\\n\\n“certainly. the police have finished with it. but the body has been\\nremoved.”\\n\\nshe accompanied me to the scene of the crime. at that moment havering\\nentered the hall, and with a quick apology his wife ran to him. i\\nwas left to undertake my investigations alone.\\n\\ni may as well confess at once that they were rather disappointing.\\nin detective novels clues abound, but here i could find nothing\\nthat struck me as out of the ordinary except a large bloodstain on\\nthe carpet where i judged the dead man had fallen. i examined\\neverything with painstaking care and took a couple of pictures of\\nthe room with my little camera which i had brought with me. i also\\nexamined the ground outside the window, but it appeared to have\\nbeen so heavily trampled underfoot that i judged it was useless to\\nwaste time over it. no, i had seen all that hunter’s lodge had to\\nshow me. i must go back to elmer’s dale and get into touch with\\njapp. accordingly i took leave of the haverings, and was driven\\noff in the car that had brought us up from the station.\\n\\ni found japp at the matlock arms and he took me forthwith to see\\nthe body. harrington pace was a small, spare clean-shaven man,\\ntypically american in appearance. he had been shot through the back\\nof the head, and the revolver had been discharged at close quarters.\\n\\n“turned away for a moment,” remarked japp, “and the other fellow\\nsnatched up a revolver and shot him. the one mrs. havering handed\\nover to us was fully loaded and i suppose the other one was also.\\ncurious what darn fool things people do. fancy keeping two loaded\\nrevolvers hanging up on your wall.”\\n\\n“what do you think of the case?” i asked, as we left the gruesome\\nchamber behind us.\\n\\n“well, i’d got my eye on havering to begin with. oh, yes!” noting\\nmy exclamation of astonishment. “havering has one or two shady\\nincidents in his past. when he was a boy at oxford there was some\\nfunny business about the signature on one of his father’s cheques.\\nall hushed up of course. then, he’s pretty heavily in debt now,\\nand they’re the kind of debts he wouldn’t like to go to his uncle\\nabout, whereas you may be sure the uncle’s will would be in his\\nfavour. yes, i’d got my eye on him, and that’s why i wanted to\\nspeak to him before he saw his wife, but their statements dovetail\\nall right, and i’ve been to the station and there’s no doubt\\nwhatever that he left by the 6.15. that gets up to london about\\n10.30. he went straight to his club, he says, and if that’s\\nconfirmed all right—why, he couldn’t have been shooting his uncle\\nhere at nine o’clock in a black beard!”\\n\\n“ah, yes, i was going to ask you what you thought about that\\nbeard?”\\n\\njapp winked.\\n\\n“i think it grew pretty fast—grew in the five miles from elmer’s\\ndale to hunter’s lodge. americans that i’ve met are mostly\\nclean-shaven. yes, it’s amongst mr. pace’s american associates that\\nwe’ll have to look for the murderer. i questioned the housekeeper\\nfirst, and then her mistress, and their stories agree all right,\\nbut i’m sorry mrs. havering didn’t get a look at the fellow. she’s\\na smart woman, and she might have noticed something that would set\\nus on the track.”\\n\\ni sat down and wrote a minute and lengthy account to poirot. i was\\nable to add various further items of information before i posted\\nthe letter.\\n\\nthe bullet had been extracted and was proved to have been fired\\nfrom a revolver identical with the one held by the police.\\nfurthermore, mr. havering’s movements on the night in question had\\nbeen checked and verified, and it was proved beyond doubt that he\\nhad actually arrived in london by the train in question. and,\\nthirdly, a sensational development had occurred. a city gentleman,\\nliving at ealing, on crossing haven green to get to the district\\nrailway station that morning, had observed a brown-paper parcel\\nstuck between the railings. opening it, he found that it contained\\na revolver. he handed the parcel over to the local police station,\\nand before night it was proved to be the one we were in search of,\\nthe fellow to that given us by mrs. havering. one bullet had been\\nfired from it.\\n\\nall this i added to my report. a wire from poirot arrived whilst\\ni was at breakfast the following morning:\\n\\n“of course black bearded man was not havering only you or japp\\nwould have such an idea wire me description of housekeeper and what\\nclothes she wore this morning same of mrs. havering do not waste\\ntime taking photographs of interiors they are underexposed and not\\nin the least artistic.”\\n\\nit seemed to me that poirot’s style was unnecessarily facetious.\\ni also fancied he was a shade jealous of my position on the spot\\nwith full facilities for handling the case. his request for a\\ndescription of the clothes worn by the two women appeared to me to\\nbe simply ridiculous, but i complied as well as i, a mere man, was\\nable to.\\n\\nat eleven a reply wire came from poirot:\\n\\n“advise japp arrest housekeeper before it is too late.”\\n\\ndumbfounded, i took the wire to japp. he swore softly under his\\nbreath.\\n\\n“he’s the goods, monsieur poirot! if he says so, there’s something\\nin it. and i hardly noticed the woman. i don’t know that i can go\\nso far as arresting her, but i’ll have her watched. we’ll go up\\nright away, and take another look at her.”\\n\\nbut it was too late. mrs. middleton, that quiet middle-aged woman,\\nwho had appeared so normal and respectable, had vanished into thin\\nair. her box had been left behind. it contained only ordinary\\nwearing apparel. there was no clue in it to her identity, or as to\\nher whereabouts.\\n\\nfrom mrs. havering we elicited all the facts we could:\\n\\n“i engaged her about three weeks ago when mrs. emery, our former\\nhousekeeper, left. she came to me from mrs. selbourne’s agency in\\nmount street—a very well-known place. i get all my servants from\\nthere. they sent several women to see me, but this mrs. middleton\\nseemed much the nicest, and had splendid references. i engaged her\\non the spot, and notified the agency of the fact. i can’t believe\\nthat there was anything wrong with her. she was such a nice quiet\\nwoman.”\\n\\nthe thing was certainly a mystery. whilst it was clear that the\\nwoman herself could not have committed the crime, since at the\\nmoment the shot was fired mrs. havering was with her in the hall,\\nnevertheless she must have some connection with the murder, or why\\nshould she suddenly take to her heels and bolt?\\n\\ni wired the latest development to poirot and suggested returning\\nto london and making inquiries at selbourne’s agency.\\n\\npoirot’s reply was prompt:\\n\\n“useless to inquire at agency they will never have heard of her\\nfind out what vehicle took her up to hunters lodge when she first\\narrived there.”\\n\\nthough mystified, i was obedient. the means of transport in elmer’s\\ndale were limited. the local garage had two battered ford cars,\\nand there were two station flies. none of these had been\\nrequisitioned on the date in question. questioned, mrs. havering\\nexplained that she had given the woman the money for her fare down\\nto derbyshire and sufficient to hire a car or fly to take her up\\nto hunter’s lodge. there was usually one of the fords at the\\nstation on the chance of its being required. taking into\\nconsideration the further fact that nobody at the station had\\nnoticed the arrival of a stranger, black-bearded or otherwise, on\\nthe fatal evening, everything seemed to point to the conclusion\\nthat the murderer had come to the spot in a car, which had been\\nwaiting near at hand to aid his escape, and that the same car had\\nbrought the mysterious housekeeper to her new post. i may mention\\nthat inquiries at the agency in london bore out poirot’s\\nprognostication. no such woman as “mrs. middleton” had ever been\\non their books. they had received the hon. mrs. havering’s\\napplication for a housekeeper, and had sent her various applicants\\nfor the post. when she sent them the engagement fee, she omitted\\nto mention which woman she had selected.\\n\\nsomewhat crestfallen, i returned to london. i found poirot\\nestablished in an arm-chair by the fire in a garish, silk\\ndressing-gown. he greeted me with much affection.\\n\\n“_mon ami_ hastings! but how glad i am to see you. veritably i have\\nfor you a great affection. and you have enjoyed yourself? you have\\nrun to and fro with the good japp? you have interrogated and\\ninvestigated to your heart’s content?”\\n\\n“poirot,” i cried, “the thing’s a dark mystery! it will never be\\nsolved.”\\n\\n“it is true that we are not likely to cover ourselves with glory\\nover it.”\\n\\n“no, indeed. it’s a hard nut to crack.”\\n\\n“oh, as far as that goes, i am very good at cracking the nuts! a\\nveritable squirrel! it is not that which embarrasses me. i know\\nwell enough who killed mr. harrington pace.”\\n\\n“you know? how did you find out?”\\n\\n“your illuminating answers to my wires supplied me with the truth.\\nsee here, hastings, let us examine the facts methodically and in\\norder. mr. harrington pace is a man with a considerable fortune\\nwhich at his death will doubtless pass to his nephew. point no. 1.\\nhis nephew is known to be desperately hard up. point no. 2. his\\nnephew is also known to be—shall we say a man of rather loose\\nmoral fibre? point no. 3.”\\n\\n“but roger havering is proved to have journeyed straight up to\\nlondon.”\\n\\n“_précisément_—and therefore, as mr. havering left elmer’s dale at\\n6.15, and since mr. pace cannot have been killed before he left,\\nor the doctor would have spotted the time of the crime as being\\ngiven wrongly when he examined the body, we conclude quite rightly,\\nthat mr. havering did not shoot his uncle. but there is a mrs.\\nhavering, hastings.”\\n\\n“impossible! the housekeeper was with her when the shot was fired.”\\n\\n“ah, yes, the housekeeper. but she has disappeared.”\\n\\n“she will be found.”\\n\\n“i think not. there is something peculiarly elusive about that\\nhousekeeper, don’t you think so, hastings? it struck me at once.”\\n\\n“she played her part, i suppose, and then got out in the nick of\\ntime.”\\n\\n“and what was her part?”\\n\\n“well, presumably to admit her confederate, the black-bearded man.”\\n\\n“oh, no, that was not her part! her part was what you have just\\nmentioned, to provide an alibi for mrs. havering at the moment the\\nshot was fired. and no one will ever find her, _mon ami_, because\\nshe does not exist! ‘there’s no sech person,’ as your so great\\nshakespeare says.”\\n\\n“it was dickens,” i murmured, unable to suppress a smile. “but what\\ndo you mean, poirot?”\\n\\n“i mean that zoe havering was an actress before her marriage, that\\nyou and japp only saw the housekeeper in a dark hall, a dim\\nmiddle-aged figure in black with a faint subdued voice, and finally\\nthat neither you nor japp, nor the local police whom the housekeeper\\nfetched, ever saw mrs. middleton and her mistress at one and the\\nsame time. it was child’s play for that clever and daring woman.\\non the pretext of summoning her mistress, she runs upstairs, slips\\non a bright jumper and a hat with black curls attached which she\\njams down over the grey transformation. a few deft touches, and\\nthe make-up is removed, a slight dusting of rouge, and the brilliant\\nzoe havering comes down with her clear ringing voice. nobody looks\\nparticularly at the housekeeper. why should they? there is nothing\\nto connect her with the crime. she, too, has an alibi.”\\n\\n“but the revolver that was found at ealing? mrs. havering could\\nnot have placed it there?”\\n\\n“no, that was roger havering’s job—but it was a mistake on their\\npart. it put me on the right track. a man who has committed a\\nmurder with a revolver which he found on the spot would fling it\\naway at once, he would not carry it up to london with him. no, the\\nmotive was clear, the criminals wished to focus the interest of\\nthe police on a spot far removed from derbyshire they were anxious\\nto get the police away as soon as possible from the vicinity of\\nhunter’s lodge. of course the revolver found at ealing was not the\\none with which mr. pace was shot. roger havering discharged one\\nshot from it, brought it up to london, went straight to his club\\nto establish his alibi, then went quickly out to ealing by the\\ndistrict, a matter of about twenty minutes only, placed the parcel\\nwhere it was found and so back to town. that charming creature,\\nhis wife, quietly shoots mr. pace after dinner—you remember he was\\nshot from behind? another significant point, that!—reloads the\\nrevolver and puts it back in its place, and then starts off with\\nher desperate little comedy.”\\n\\n“it’s incredible,” i murmured, fascinated, “and yet——”\\n\\n“and yet it is true. _bien sur_, my friend, it is true. but to\\nbring that precious pair to justice, that is another matter. well,\\njapp must do what he can—i have written him fully—but i very much\\nfear, hastings, that we shall be obliged to leave them to fate, or\\n_le bon dieu_, whichever you prefer.”\\n\\n“the wicked flourish like a green bay tree,” i reminded him.\\n\\n“but at a price, hastings, always at a price, _croyez-moi!_”\\n\\npoirot’s forebodings were confirmed. japp, though convinced of the\\ntruth of his theory, was unable to get together the necessary\\nevidence to ensure a conviction.\\n\\nmr. pace’s huge fortune passed into the hands of his murderers.\\nnevertheless, nemesis did overtake them, and when i read in the\\npaper that the hon. roger and mrs. havering were amongst those\\nkilled in the crashing of the air mail to paris i knew that justice\\nwas satisfied.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  v\\n\\n  the million dollar bond robbery\\n\\n“what a number of bond robberies there have been lately!” i observed\\none morning, laying aside the newspaper. “poirot, let us forsake\\nthe science of detection, and take to crime instead!”\\n\\n“you are on the—how do you say it?—get-rich-quick tack, eh, _mon\\nami_?”\\n\\n“well, look at this last _coup_, the million dollars’ worth of\\nliberty bonds which the london and scottish bank were sending to\\nnew york, and which disappeared in such a remarkable manner on\\nboard the _olympia_.”\\n\\n“if it were not for the _mal de mer_, and the difficulty of\\npractising the so excellent method of laverguier for a longer time\\nthan the few hours of crossing the channel, i should delight to\\nvoyage myself on one of these big liners,” murmured poirot dreamily.\\n\\n“yes, indeed,” i said enthusiastically. “some of them must be\\nperfect palaces; the swimming-baths, the lounges, the restaurant,\\nthe palm courts—really, it must be hard to believe that one is on\\nthe sea.”\\n\\n“me, i always know when i am on the sea,” said poirot sadly. “and\\nall those bagatelles that you enumerate, they say nothing to me;\\nbut, my friend, consider for a moment the geniuses that travel as\\nit were incognito! on board these floating palaces, as you so\\njustly call them, one would meet the élite, the _haute noblesse_\\nof the criminal world!”\\n\\ni laughed.\\n\\n“so that’s the way your enthusiasm runs! you would have liked to\\ncross swords with the man who sneaked the liberty bonds?”\\n\\nthe landlady interrupted us.\\n\\n“a young lady as wants to see you, mr. poirot. here’s her card.”\\n\\nthe card bore the inscription: miss esmée farquhar, and poirot,\\nafter diving under the table to retrieve a stray crumb, and putting\\nit carefully in the waste-paper-basket, nodded to the landlady to\\nadmit her.\\n\\nin another minute one of the most charming girls i have ever seen\\nwas ushered into the room. she was perhaps about five-and-twenty,\\nwith big brown eyes and a perfect figure. she was well-dressed and\\nperfectly composed in manner.\\n\\n“sit down, i beg of you, mademoiselle. this is my friend, captain\\nhastings, who aids me in my little problems.”\\n\\n“i am afraid it is a big problem i have brought you to-day, monsieur\\npoirot,” said the girl, giving me a pleasant bow as she seated\\nherself. “i dare say you have read about it in the papers. i am\\nreferring to the theft of liberty bonds on the _olympia_.” some\\nastonishment must have shown itself in poirot’s face, for she\\ncontinued quickly: “you are doubtless asking yourself what i have\\nto do with a grave institution like the london and scottish bank.\\nin one sense nothing, in another sense everything. you see, monsieur\\npoirot, i am engaged to mr. philip ridgeway.”\\n\\n“aha! and mr. philip ridgeway——”\\n\\n“was in charge of the bonds when they were stolen. of course no\\nactual blame can attach to him, it was not his fault in any way.\\nnevertheless, he is half distraught over the matter, and his uncle,\\ni know, insists that he must carelessly have mentioned having them\\nin his possession. it is a terrible set-back in his career.”\\n\\n“who is his uncle?”\\n\\n“mr. vavasour, joint general manager of the london and scottish\\nbank.”\\n\\n“suppose, miss farquhar, that you recount to me the whole story?”\\n\\n“very well. as you know, the bank wished to extend their credits\\nin america, and for this purpose decided to send over a million\\ndollars in liberty bonds. mr. vavasour selected his nephew, who\\nhad occupied a position of trust in the bank for many years and\\nwho was conversant with all the details of the bank’s dealings in\\nnew york, to make the trip. the olympia sailed from liverpool on\\nthe 23rd, and the bonds were handed over to philip on the morning\\nof that day by mr. vavasour and mr. shaw, the two joint general\\nmanagers of the london and scottish bank. they were counted,\\nenclosed in a package, and sealed in his presence, and he then\\nlocked the package at once in his portmanteau.”\\n\\n“a portmanteau with an ordinary lock?”\\n\\n“no, mr. shaw insisted on a special lock being fitted to it by\\nhubbs’s. philip, as i say, placed the package at the bottom of the\\ntrunk. it was stolen just a few hours before reaching new york. a\\nrigorous search of the whole ship was made, but without result.\\nthe bonds seemed literally to have vanished into thin air.”\\n\\npoirot made a grimace.\\n\\n“but they did not vanish absolutely, since i gather that they were\\nsold in small parcels within half an hour of the docking of the\\n_olympia_! well, undoubtedly the next thing is for me to see mr.\\nridgeway.”\\n\\n“i was about to suggest that you should lunch with me at the\\n‘cheshire cheese.’ philip will be there. he is meeting me, but does\\nnot yet know that i have been consulting you on his behalf.”\\n\\nwe agreed to this suggestion readily enough, and drove there in a\\ntaxi.\\n\\nmr. philip ridgeway was there before us, and looked somewhat\\nsurprised to see his fiancée arriving with two complete strangers.\\nhe was a nice-looking young fellow, tall and spruce, with a touch\\nof greying hair at the temples, though he could not have been much\\nover thirty.\\n\\nmiss farquhar went up to him and laid her hand on his arm.\\n\\n“you must forgive my acting without consulting you, philip,” she\\nsaid. “let me introduce you to monsieur hercule poirot, of whom\\nyou must often have heard, and his friend, captain hastings.”\\n\\nridgeway looked very astonished.\\n\\n“of course i have heard of you, monsieur poirot,” he said, as he\\nshook hands. “but i had no idea that esmée was thinking of\\nconsulting you about my—our trouble.”\\n\\n“i was afraid you would not let me do it, philip,” said miss\\nfarquhar meekly.\\n\\n“so you took care to be on the safe side,” he observed, with a\\nsmile. “i hope monsieur poirot will be able to throw some light on\\nthis extraordinary puzzle, for i confess frankly that i am nearly\\nout of my mind with worry and anxiety about it.”\\n\\nindeed, his face looked drawn and haggard and showed only too\\nclearly the strain under which he was labouring.\\n\\n“well, well,” said poirot. “let us lunch, and over lunch we will\\nput our heads together and see what can be done. i want to hear\\nmr. ridgeway’s story from his own lips.”\\n\\nwhilst we discussed the excellent steak and kidney pudding of the\\nestablishment, philip ridgeway narrated the circumstances leading\\nto the disappearance of the bonds. his story agreed with that of\\nmiss farquhar in every particular. when he had finished, poirot\\ntook up the thread with a question.\\n\\n“what exactly led you to discover that the bonds had been stolen,\\nmr. ridgeway?”\\n\\nhe laughed rather bitterly.\\n\\n“the thing stared me in the face, monsieur poirot. i couldn’t have\\nmissed it. my cabin trunk was half out from under the bunk and all\\nscratched and cut about where they’d tried to force the lock.”\\n\\n“but i understood that it had been opened with a key?”\\n\\n“that’s so. they tried to force it, but couldn’t. and, in the end,\\nthey must have got it unlocked somehow or other.”\\n\\n“curious,” said poirot, his eyes beginning to flicker with the\\ngreen light i knew so well. “very curious! they waste much, much\\ntime trying to prise it open, and then—_sapristi!_ they find that\\nthey have the key all the time—for each of hubbs’s locks are\\nunique.”\\n\\n“that’s just why they couldn’t have had the key. it never left me\\nday or night.”\\n\\n“you are sure of that?”\\n\\n“i can swear to it, and besides, if they had had the key or a\\nduplicate, why should they waste time trying to force an obviously\\nunforceable lock?”\\n\\n“ah! there is exactly the question we are asking ourselves! i\\nventure to prophesy that the solution, if we ever find it, will\\nhinge on that curious fact. i beg of you not to assault me if i\\nask you one more question: _are you perfectly certain you did not\\nleave the trunk unlocked?_”\\n\\nphilip ridgeway merely looked at him, and poirot gesticulated\\napologetically.\\n\\n“ah, but these things can happen, i assure you! very well, the\\nbonds were stolen from the trunk. what did the thief do with them?\\nhow did he manage to get ashore with them?”\\n\\n“ah!” cried ridgeway. “that’s just it. how? word was passed to the\\ncustoms authorities, and every soul that left the ship was gone\\nover with a toothcomb!”\\n\\n“and the bonds, i gather, made a bulky package?”\\n\\n“certainly they did. they could hardly have been hidden on board—and\\nanyway we know they weren’t because they were offered for sale\\nwithin half an hour of the _olympia’s_ arrival, long before i got\\nthe cables going and the numbers sent out. one broker swears he\\nbought some of them even before the _olympia_ got in. but you can’t\\nsend bonds by wireless.”\\n\\n“not by wireless, but did any tug come alongside?”\\n\\n“only the official ones, and that was after the alarm was given\\nwhen every one was on the look-out. i was watching out myself for\\ntheir being passed over to some one that way. my god, monsieur\\npoirot, this thing will drive me mad! people are beginning to say\\ni stole them myself.”\\n\\n“but you also were searched on landing, weren’t you?” asked poirot\\ngently.\\n\\n“yes.”\\n\\nthe young man stared at him in a puzzled manner.\\n\\n“you do not catch my meaning, i see,” said poirot, smiling\\nenigmatically. “now i should like to make a few inquiries at the\\nbank.”\\n\\nridgeway produced a card and scribbled a few words on it.\\n\\n“send this in and my uncle will see you at once.”\\n\\npoirot thanked him, bade farewell to miss farquhar, and together\\nwe started out for threadneedle street and the head office of the\\nlondon and scottish bank. on production of ridgeway’s card, we were\\nled through the labyrinth of counters and desks, skirting paying-in\\nclerks and paying-out clerks and up to a small office on the first\\nfloor where the joint general managers received us. they were two\\ngrave gentlemen, who had grown grey in the service of the bank.\\nmr. vavasour had a short white beard, mr. shaw was clean shaven.\\n\\n“i understand you are strictly a private inquiry agent?” said mr.\\nvavasour. “quite so, quite so. we have, of course, placed ourselves\\nin the hands of scotland yard. inspector mcneil has charge of the\\ncase. a very able officer, i believe.”\\n\\n“i am sure of it,” said poirot politely. “you will permit a few\\nquestions, on your nephew’s behalf? about this lock, who ordered\\nit from hubbs’s?”\\n\\n“i ordered it myself,” said mr. shaw. “i would not trust to any\\nclerk in the matter. as to the keys, mr. ridgeway had one, and the\\nother two are held by my colleague and myself.”\\n\\n“and no clerk has had access to them?”\\n\\nmr. shaw turned inquiringly to mr. vavasour. “i think i am correct\\nin saying that they have remained in the safe where we placed them\\non the 23rd,” said mr. vavasour. “my colleague was unfortunately\\ntaken ill a fortnight ago—in fact on the very day that philip left\\nus. he has only just recovered.”\\n\\n“severe bronchitis is no joke to a man of my age,” said mr. shaw\\nruefully. “but i am afraid mr. vavasour has suffered from the hard\\nwork entailed by my absence, especially with this unexpected worry\\ncoming on top of everything.”\\n\\npoirot asked a few more questions. i judged that he was endeavouring\\nto gauge the exact amount of intimacy between uncle and nephew.\\nmr. vavasour’s answers were brief and punctilious. his nephew was\\na trusted official of the bank, and had no debts or money\\ndifficulties that he knew of. he had been entrusted with similar\\nmissions in the past. finally we were politely bowed out.\\n\\n“i am disappointed,” said poirot, as we emerged into the street.\\n\\n“you hoped to discover more? they are such stodgy old men.”\\n\\n“it is not their stodginess which disappoints me, _mon ami_. i do\\nnot expect to find in a bank manager a ‘keen financier with an\\neagle glance’ as your favourite works of fiction put it. no, i am\\ndisappointed in the case—it is too easy!”\\n\\n“easy?”\\n\\n“yes, do you not find it almost childishly simple?”\\n\\n“you know who stole the bonds?”\\n\\n“i do.”\\n\\n“but then—we must—why——”\\n\\n“do not confuse and fluster yourself, hastings. we are not going\\nto do anything at present.”\\n\\n“but why? what are you waiting for?”\\n\\n“for the _olympia_. she is due on her return trip from new york on\\ntuesday.”\\n\\n“but if you know who stole the bonds, why wait? he may escape.”\\n\\n“to a south sea island where there is no extradition? no, _mon\\nami_, he would find life very uncongenial there. as to why i\\nwait—_eh bien_ to the intelligence of hercule poirot the case is\\nperfectly clear, but for the benefit of others, not so greatly\\ngifted by the good god—the inspector mcneil, for instance—it would\\nbe as well to make a few inquiries to establish the facts. one must\\nhave consideration for those less gifted than oneself.”\\n\\n“good lord, poirot! do you know, i’d give a considerable sum of\\nmoney to see you make a thorough ass of yourself—just for once.\\nyou’re so confoundedly conceited!”\\n\\n“do not enrage yourself, hastings. in verity, i observe that there\\nare times when you almost detest me! alas, i suffer the penalties\\nof greatness!”\\n\\nthe little man puffed out his chest, and sighed so comically that\\ni was forced to laugh.\\n\\ntuesday saw us speeding to liverpool in a first-class carriage of\\nthe l. & n.w.r. poirot had obstinately refused to enlighten me as\\nto his suspicions—or certainties. he contented himself with\\nexpressing surprise that i, too, was not equally _au fait_ with\\nthe situation. i disdained to argue, and entrenched my curiosity\\nbehind a rampart of pretended indifference.\\n\\nonce arrived at the quay alongside which lay the big transatlantic\\nliner, poirot became brisk and alert. our proceedings consisted in\\ninterviewing four successive stewards and inquiring after a friend\\nof poirot’s who had crossed to new york on the 23rd.\\n\\n“an elderly gentleman, wearing glasses. a great invalid, hardly\\nmoved out of his cabin.”\\n\\nthe description appeared to tally with one mr. ventnor who had\\noccupied the cabin c 24 which was next to that of philip ridgeway.\\nalthough unable to see how poirot had deduced mr. ventnor’s\\nexistence and personal appearance, i was keenly excited.\\n\\n“tell me,” i cried, “was this gentleman one of the first to land\\nwhen you got to new york?” the steward shook his head.\\n\\n“no, indeed, sir, he was one of the last off the boat.”\\n\\ni retired crestfallen, and observed poirot grinning at me. he\\nthanked the steward, a note changed hands, and we took our\\ndeparture.\\n\\n“it’s all very well,” i remarked heatedly, “but that last answer\\nmust have damped your precious theory, grin as you please!”\\n\\n“as usual, you see nothing, hastings. that last answer is, on the\\ncontrary, the coping-stone of my theory.”\\n\\ni flung up my hands in despair.\\n\\n“i give it up.”\\n\\n\\n  •   •   •   •   •   •   •\\n\\n\\nwhen we were in the train, speeding towards london, poirot wrote\\nbusily for a few minutes, sealing up the result in an envelope.\\n\\n“this is for the good inspector mcneil. we will leave it at scotland\\nyard in passing, and then to the rendezvous restaurant, where i\\nhave asked miss esmée farquhar to do us the honour of dining with\\nus.”\\n\\n“what about ridgeway?”\\n\\n“what about him?” asked poirot with a twinkle.\\n\\n“why, you surely don’t think—you can’t——”\\n\\n“the habit of incoherence is growing upon you, hastings. as a\\nmatter of fact i _did_ think. if ridgeway had been the thief—which\\nwas perfectly possible—the case would have been charming; a piece\\nof neat methodical work.”\\n\\n“but not so charming for miss farquhar.”\\n\\n“possibly you are right. therefore all is for the best. now,\\nhastings, let us review the case. i can see that you are dying to\\ndo so. the sealed package is removed from the trunk and vanishes,\\nas miss farquhar puts it, into thin air. we will dismiss the thin\\nair theory, which is not practicable at the present stage of\\nscience, and consider what is likely to have become of it. every\\none asserts the incredibility of its being smuggled ashore——”\\n\\n“yes, but we know——”\\n\\n“_you_ may know, hastings. i do not. i take the view that, since\\nit seemed incredible, it _was_ incredible. two possibilities\\nremain: it was hidden on board—also rather difficult—or it was\\nthrown overboard.”\\n\\n“with a cork on it, do you mean?”\\n\\n“without a cork.”\\n\\ni stared.\\n\\n“but if the bonds were thrown overboard, they couldn’t have been\\nsold in new york.”\\n\\n“i admire your logical mind, hastings. the bonds were sold in new\\nyork, therefore they were not thrown overboard. you see where that\\nleads us?”\\n\\n“where we were when we started.”\\n\\n“_jamais de la vie!_ if the package was thrown overboard, and the\\nbonds were sold in new york, the package could not have contained\\nthe bonds. is there any evidence that the package _did_ contain\\nthe bonds? remember, mr. ridgeway never opened it from the time it\\nwas placed in his hands in london.”\\n\\n“yes, but then——”\\n\\npoirot waved an impatient hand.\\n\\n“permit me to continue. the last moment that the bonds are seen as\\nbonds is in the office of the london and scottish bank on the\\nmorning of the 23rd. they reappear in new york half an hour after\\nthe _olympia_ gets in, and according to one man, whom nobody\\nlistens to, actually _before_ she gets in. supposing then, that\\nthey have never been on the _olympia_ at all? is there any other\\nway they could get to new york? yes. the _gigantic_ leaves\\nsouthampton on the same day as the _olympia_, and she holds the\\nrecord for the atlantic. mailed by the _gigantic_, the bonds would\\nbe in new york the day before the _olympia_ arrived. all is clear,\\nthe case begins to explain itself. the sealed packet is only a\\ndummy, and the moment of its substitution must be in the office in\\nthe bank. it would be an easy matter for any of the three men\\npresent to have prepared a duplicate package which could be\\nsubstituted for the genuine one. _très bien_, the bonds are mailed\\nto a confederate in new york, with instructions to sell as soon as\\nthe _olympia_ is in, but some one must travel on the _olympia_ to\\nengineer the supposed moment of the robbery.”\\n\\n“but why?”\\n\\n“because if ridgeway merely opens the packet and finds it a dummy,\\nsuspicion flies at once to london. no, the man on board in the\\ncabin next door does his work, pretends to force the lock in an\\nobvious manner so as to draw immediate attention to the theft,\\nreally unlocks the trunk with a duplicate key, throws the package\\noverboard and waits until the last to leave the boat. naturally he\\nwears glasses to conceal his eyes, and is an invalid since he does\\nnot want to run the risk of meeting ridgeway. he steps ashore in\\nnew york and returns by the first boat available.”\\n\\n“but who—which was he?”\\n\\n“the man who had a duplicate key, the man who ordered the lock,\\nthe man who has _not_ been severely ill with bronchitis at his home\\nin the country—_enfin_, that ‘stodgy’ old man, mr. shaw! there are\\ncriminals in high places sometimes, my friend. ah, here we are.\\nmademoiselle, i have succeeded! you permit?”\\n\\nand, beaming, poirot kissed the astonished girl lightly on either\\ncheek!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  vi\\n\\n\\n  the adventure of the egyptian tomb\\n\\n\\ni have always considered that one of the most thrilling and dramatic\\nof the many adventures i have shared with poirot was that of our\\ninvestigation into the strange series of deaths which followed upon\\nthe discovery and opening of the tomb of king men-her-ra.\\n\\nhard upon the discovery of the tomb of tut-ankh-amen by lord\\ncarnarvon, sir john willard and mr. bleibner of new york, pursuing\\ntheir excavations not far from cairo, in the vicinity of the\\npyramids of gizeh, came unexpectedly on a series of funeral\\nchambers. the greatest interest was aroused by their discovery.\\nthe tomb appeared to be that of king men-her-ra, one of those\\nshadowy kings of the eighth dynasty, when the old kingdom was\\nfalling to decay. little was known about this period, and the\\ndiscoveries were fully reported in the newspapers.\\n\\nan event soon occurred which took a profound hold on the public\\nmind. sir john willard died quite suddenly of heart failure.\\n\\nthe more sensational newspapers immediately took the opportunity\\nof reviving all the old superstitious stories connected with the\\nill luck of certain egyptian treasures. the unlucky mummy at the\\nbritish museum, that hoary old chestnut, was dragged out with fresh\\nzest, was quietly denied by the museum, but nevertheless enjoyed\\nall its usual vogue.\\n\\na fortnight later mr. bleibner died of acute blood poisoning, and\\na few days afterwards a nephew of his shot himself in new york.\\nthe “curse of men-her-ra” was the talk of the day, and the magic\\npower of dead and gone egypt was exalted to a fetish point.\\n\\nit was then that poirot received a brief note from lady willard,\\nwidow of the dead archaeologist, asking him to go and see her at\\nher house in kensington square. i accompanied him.\\n\\nlady willard was a tall, thin woman, dressed in deep mourning. her\\nhaggard face bore eloquent testimony to her recent grief.\\n\\n“it is kind of you to have come so promptly, monsieur poirot.”\\n\\n“i am at your service, lady willard. you wished to consult me?”\\n\\n“you are, i am aware, a detective, but it is not only as a detective\\nthat i wish to consult you. you are a man of original views, i\\nknow, you have imagination, experience of the world, tell me,\\nmonsieur poirot, what are your views on the supernatural?”\\n\\npoirot hesitated for a moment before he replied. he seemed to be\\nconsidering. finally he said:\\n\\n“let us not misunderstand each other, lady willard. it is not a\\ngeneral question that you are asking me there. it has a personal\\napplication, has it not? you are referring obliquely to the death\\nof your late husband?”\\n\\n“that is so,” she admitted.\\n\\n“you want me to investigate the circumstances of his death?”\\n\\n“i want you to ascertain for me exactly how much is newspaper\\nchatter, and how much may be said to be founded on fact? three\\ndeaths, monsieur poirot—each one explicable taken by itself, but\\ntaken together surely an almost unbelievable coincidence, and all\\nwithin a month of the opening of the tomb! it may be mere\\nsuperstition, it may be some potent curse from the past that\\noperates in ways undreamed of by modern science. the fact\\nremains—three deaths! and i am afraid, monsieur poirot, horribly\\nafraid. it may not yet be the end.”\\n\\n“for whom do you fear?”\\n\\n“for my son. when the news of my husband’s death came i was ill.\\nmy son, who has just come down from oxford, went out there. he\\nbrought the—the body home, but now he has gone out again, in spite\\nof my prayers and entreaties. he is so fascinated by the work that\\nhe intends to take his father’s place and carry on the system of\\nexcavations. you may think me a foolish, credulous woman, but,\\nmonsieur poirot, i am afraid. supposing that the spirit of the dead\\nking is not yet appeased? perhaps to you i seem to be talking\\nnonsense——”\\n\\n“no, indeed, lady willard,” said poirot quickly. “i, too, believe\\nin the force of superstition, one of the greatest forces the world\\nhas ever known.”\\n\\ni looked at him in surprise. i should never have credited poirot\\nwith being superstitious. but the little man was obviously in\\nearnest.\\n\\n“what you really demand is that i shall protect your son? i will\\ndo my utmost to keep him from harm.”\\n\\n“yes, in the ordinary way, but against an occult influence?”\\n\\n“in volumes of the middle ages, lady willard, you will find many\\nways of counteracting black magic. perhaps they knew more than we\\nmoderns with all our boasted science. now let us come to facts,\\nthat i may have guidance. your husband had always been a devoted\\negyptologist, hadn’t he?”\\n\\n“yes, from his youth upwards. he was one of the greatest living\\nauthorities upon the subject.”\\n\\n“but mr. bleibner, i understand, was more or less of an amateur?”\\n\\n“oh, quite. he was a very wealthy man who dabbled freely in any\\nsubject that happened to take his fancy. my husband managed to\\ninterest him in egyptology, and it was his money that was so useful\\nin financing the expedition.”\\n\\n“and the nephew? what do you know of his tastes? was he with the\\nparty at all?”\\n\\n“i do not think so. in fact i never knew of his existence till i\\nread of his death in the paper, i do not think he and mr. bleibner\\ncan have been at all intimate. he never spoke of having any\\nrelations.”\\n\\n“who are the other members of the party?”\\n\\n“well, there is dr. tosswill, a minor official connected with the\\nbritish museum; mr. schneider of the metropolitan museum in new\\nyork; a young american secretary; dr. ames, who accompanies the\\nexpedition in his professional capacity; and hassan, my husband’s\\ndevoted native servant.”\\n\\n“do you remember the name of the american secretary?”\\n\\n“harper, i think, but i cannot be sure. he had not been with mr.\\nbleibner very long, i know. he was a very pleasant young fellow.”\\n\\n“thank you, lady willard.”\\n\\n“if there is anything else——?”\\n\\n“for the moment, nothing. leave it now in my hands, and be assured\\nthat i will do all that is humanly possible to protect your son.”\\n\\nthey were not exactly reassuring words, and i observed lady willard\\nwince as he uttered them. yet, at the same time, the fact that he\\nhad not pooh-poohed her fears seemed in itself to be a relief to\\nher.\\n\\nfor my part i had never before suspected that poirot had so deep\\na vein of superstition in his nature. i tackled him on the subject\\nas we went homewards. his manner was grave and earnest.\\n\\n“but yes, hastings. i believe in these things. you must not\\nunderrate the force of superstition.”\\n\\n“what are we going to do about it?”\\n\\n“_toujours pratique_, the good hastings! _eh bien_, to begin with\\nwe are going to cable to new york for fuller details of young mr.\\nbleibner’s death.”\\n\\nhe duly sent off his cable. the reply was full and precise. young\\nrupert bleibner had been in low water for several years. he had\\nbeen a beach-comber and a remittance man in several south sea\\nislands, but had returned to new york two years ago, where he had\\nrapidly sunk lower and lower. the most significant thing, to my\\nmind, was that he had recently managed to borrow enough money to\\ntake him to egypt. “i’ve a good friend there i can borrow from,”\\nhe had declared. here, however, his plans had gone awry. he had\\nreturned to new york cursing his skinflint of an uncle who cared\\nmore for the bones of dead and gone kings than his own flesh and\\nblood. it was during his sojourn in egypt that the death of sir\\njohn willard occurred. rupert had plunged once more into his life\\nof dissipation in new york, and then, without warning, he had\\ncommitted suicide, leaving behind him a letter which contained some\\ncurious phrases. it seemed written in a sudden fit of remorse. he\\nreferred to himself as a leper and an outcast, and the letter ended\\nby declaring that such as he were better dead.\\n\\na shadowy theory leapt into my brain. i had never really believed\\nin the vengeance of a long dead egyptian king. i saw here a more\\nmodern crime. supposing this young man had decided to do away with\\nhis uncle—preferably by poison. by mistake, sir john willard\\nreceives the fatal dose. the young man returns to new york, haunted\\nby his crime. the news of his uncle’s death reaches him. he realizes\\nhow unnecessary his crime has been, and stricken with remorse takes\\nhis own life.\\n\\ni outlined my solution to poirot. he was interested.\\n\\n“it is ingenious what you have thought of there—decidedly it is\\ningenious. it may even be true. but you leave out of count the\\nfatal influence of the tomb.”\\n\\ni shrugged my shoulders.\\n\\n“you still think that has something to do with it?”\\n\\n“so much so, _mon ami_, that we start for egypt to-morrow.”\\n\\n“what?” i cried, astonished.\\n\\n“i have said it.” an expression of conscious heroism spread over\\npoirot’s face. then he groaned. “but, oh,” he lamented, “the sea!\\nthe hateful sea!”\\n\\n\\n  •   •   •   •   •   •   •\\n\\n\\nit was a week later. beneath our feet was the golden sand of the\\ndesert. the hot sun poured down overhead. poirot, the picture of\\nmisery, wilted by my side. the little man was not a good traveller.\\nour four days’ voyage from marseilles had been one long agony to\\nhim. he had landed at alexandria the wraith of his former self,\\neven his usual neatness had deserted him. we had arrived in cairo\\nand had driven out at once to the mena house hotel, right in the\\nshadow of the pyramids.\\n\\nthe charm of egypt had laid hold of me. not so poirot. dressed\\nprecisely the same as in london, he carried a small clothes-brush\\nin his pocket and waged an unceasing war on the dust which\\naccumulated on his dark apparel.\\n\\n“and my boots,” he wailed. “regard them, hastings. my boots, of\\nthe neat patent leather, usually so smart and shining. see, the\\nsand is inside them, which is painful, and outside them, which\\noutrages the eyesight. also the heat, it causes my moustaches to\\nbecome limp—but limp!”\\n\\n“look at the sphinx,” i urged. “even i can feel the mystery and\\nthe charm it exhales.”\\n\\npoirot looked at it discontentedly.\\n\\n“it has not the air happy,” he declared. “how could it, half-buried\\nin sand in that untidy fashion. ah, this cursed sand!”\\n\\n“come, now, there’s a lot of sand in belgium,” i reminded him,\\nmindful of a holiday spent at knocke-sur-mer in the midst of “_les\\ndunes impeccables_” as the guide-book had phrased it.\\n\\n“not in brussels,” declared poirot. he gazed at the pyramids\\nthoughtfully. “it is true that they, at least, are of a shape solid\\nand geometrical, but their surface is of an unevenness most\\nunpleasing. and the palm-trees i like them not. not even do they\\nplant them in rows!”\\n\\ni cut short his lamentations, by suggesting that we should start\\nfor the camp. we were to ride there on camels, and the beasts were\\npatiently kneeling, waiting for us to mount, in charge of several\\npicturesque boys headed by a voluble dragoman.\\n\\ni pass over the spectacle of poirot on a camel. he started by\\ngroans and lamentations and ended by shrieks, gesticulations and\\ninvocations to the virgin mary and every saint in the calendar. in\\nthe end, he descended ignominiously and finished the journey on a\\ndiminutive donkey. i must admit that a trotting camel is no joke\\nfor the amateur. i was stiff for several days.\\n\\nat last we neared the scene of the excavations. a sunburnt man with\\na grey beard, in white clothes and wearing a helmet, came to meet\\nus.\\n\\n“monsieur poirot and captain hastings? we received your cable. i’m\\nsorry that there was no one to meet you in cairo. an unforeseen\\nevent occurred which completely disorganized our plans.”\\n\\npoirot paled. his hand, which had stolen to his clothes-brush,\\nstayed its course.\\n\\n“not another death?” he breathed.\\n\\n“yes.”\\n\\n“sir guy willard?” i cried.\\n\\n“no, captain hastings. my american colleague, mr. schneider.”\\n\\n“and the cause?” demanded poirot.\\n\\n“tetanus.”\\n\\ni blanched. all around me i seemed to feel an atmosphere of evil,\\nsubtle and menacing. a horrible thought flashed across me. supposing\\ni were the next?\\n\\n“_mon dieu_,” said poirot, in a very low voice, “i do not understand\\nthis. it is horrible. tell me, monsieur, there is no doubt that it\\nwas tetanus?”\\n\\n“i believe not. but dr. ames will tell you more than i can do.”\\n\\n“ah, of course, you are not the doctor.”\\n\\n“my name is tosswill.”\\n\\nthis, then, was the british expert described by lady willard as\\nbeing a minor official at the british museum. there was something\\nat once grave and steadfast about him that took my fancy.\\n\\n“if you will come with me,” continued dr. tosswill, “i will take\\nyou to sir guy willard. he was most anxious to be informed as soon\\nas you should arrive.”\\n\\nwe were taken across the camp to a large tent. dr. tosswill lifted\\nup the flap and we entered. three men were sitting inside.\\n\\n“monsieur poirot and captain hastings have arrived, sir guy,” said\\ntosswill.\\n\\nthe youngest of the three men jumped up and came forward to greet\\nus. there was a certain impulsiveness in his manner which reminded\\nme of his mother. he was not nearly so sunburnt as the others, and\\nthat fact, coupled with a certain haggardness round the eyes, made\\nhim look older than his twenty-two years. he was clearly endeavouring\\nto bear up under a severe mental strain.\\n\\nhe introduced his two companions, dr. ames, a capable looking man\\nof thirty odd, with a touch of greying hair at the temples, and\\nmr. harper, the secretary, a pleasant lean young man wearing the\\nnational insignia of horn-rimmed spectacles.\\n\\nafter a few minutes’ desultory conversation the latter went out,\\nand dr. tosswill followed him. we were left alone with sir guy and\\ndr. ames.\\n\\n“please ask any questions you want to ask, monsieur poirot,” said\\nwillard. “we are utterly dumbfounded at this strange series of\\ndisasters, but it isn’t—it can’t be, anything but coincidence.”\\n\\nthere was a nervousness about his manner which rather belied the\\nwords. i saw that poirot was studying him keenly.\\n\\n“your heart is really in this work, sir guy?”\\n\\n“rather. no matter what happens, or what comes of it, the work is\\ngoing on. make up your mind to that.”\\n\\npoirot wheeled round on the other.\\n\\n“what have you to say to that, _monsieur le docteur_?”\\n\\n“well,” drawled the doctor, “i’m not for quitting myself.”\\n\\npoirot made one of those expressive grimaces of his.\\n\\n“then, _évidemment_, we must find out just how we stand. when did\\nmr. schneider’s death take place?”\\n\\n“three days ago.”\\n\\n“you are sure it was tetanus?”\\n\\n“dead sure.”\\n\\n“it couldn’t have been a case of strychnine poisoning, for\\ninstance?”\\n\\n“no, monsieur poirot. i see what you’re getting at. but it was a\\nclear case of tetanus.”\\n\\n“did you not inject anti-serum?”\\n\\n“certainly we did,” said the doctor dryly. “every conceivable thing\\nthat could be done was tried.”\\n\\n“had you the anti-serum with you?”\\n\\n“no. we procured it from cairo.”\\n\\n“have there been any other cases of tetanus in the camp?”\\n\\n“no, not one.”\\n\\n“are you certain that the death of mr. bleibner was not due to\\ntetanus?”\\n\\n“absolutely plumb certain. he had a scratch upon his thumb which\\nbecame poisoned, and septicæmia set in. it sounds pretty much the\\nsame to a layman, i dare say, but the two things are entirely\\ndifferent.”\\n\\n“then we have four deaths—all totally dissimilar, one heart failure,\\none blood poisoning, one suicide and one tetanus.”\\n\\n“exactly, monsieur poirot.”\\n\\n“are you certain that there is nothing which might link the four\\ntogether?”\\n\\n“i don’t quite understand you?”\\n\\n“i will put it plainly. was any act committed by those four men\\nwhich might seem to denote disrespect to the spirit of men-her-ra?”\\n\\nthe doctor gazed at poirot in astonishment.\\n\\n“you’re talking through your hat, monsieur poirot. surely you’ve\\nnot been guyed into believing all that fool talk?”\\n\\n“absolute nonsense,” muttered willard angrily.\\n\\npoirot remained placidly immovable, blinking a little out of his\\ngreen cat’s eyes.\\n\\n“so you do not believe it, _monsieur le docteur_?”\\n\\n“no, sir, i do not,” declared the doctor emphatically. “i am a\\nscientific man, and i believe only what science teaches.”\\n\\n“was there no science then in ancient egypt?” asked poirot softly.\\nhe did not wait for a reply, and indeed dr. ames seemed rather at\\na loss for the moment. “no, no, do not answer me, but tell me this.\\nwhat do the native workmen think?”\\n\\n“i guess,” said dr. ames, “that, where white folk lose their heads,\\nnatives aren’t going to be far behind. i’ll admit that they’re\\ngetting what you might call scared—but they’ve no cause to be.”\\n\\n“i wonder,” said poirot non-committally.\\n\\nsir guy leant forward.\\n\\n“surely,” he cried incredulously, “you cannot believe in—oh, but\\nthe thing’s absurd! you can know nothing of ancient egypt if you\\nthink that.”\\n\\nfor answer poirot produced a little book from his pocket—an ancient\\ntattered volume. as he held it out i saw its title, _the magic of\\nthe egyptians and chaldeans_. then, wheeling round, he strode out\\nof the tent. the doctor stared at me.\\n\\n“what is his little idea?”\\n\\nthe phrase, so familiar on poirot’s lips, made me smile as it came\\nfrom another.\\n\\n“i don’t know exactly,” i confessed. “he’s got some plan of\\nexorcizing the evil spirits, i believe.”\\n\\ni went in search of poirot, and found him talking to the lean-faced\\nyoung man who had been the late mr. bleibner’s secretary.\\n\\n“no,” mr. harper was saying, “i’ve only been six months with the\\nexpedition. yes, i knew mr. bleibner’s affairs pretty well.”\\n\\n“can you recount to me anything concerning his nephew?”\\n\\n“he turned up here one day, not a bad-looking fellow. i’d never\\nmet him before, but some of the others had—ames, i think, and\\nschneider. the old man wasn’t at all pleased to see him. they were\\nat it in no time, hammer and tongs. ‘not a cent,’ the old man\\nshouted. ‘not one cent now or when i’m dead. i intend to leave my\\nmoney to the furtherance of my life’s work. i’ve been talking it\\nover with mr. schneider to-day.’ and a bit more of the same. young\\nbleibner lit out for cairo right away.”\\n\\n“was he in perfectly good health at the time?”\\n\\n“the old man?”\\n\\n“no, the young one.”\\n\\n“i believe he did mention there was something wrong with him. but\\nit couldn’t have been anything serious, or i should have remembered.”\\n\\n“one thing more, has mr. bleibner left a will?”\\n\\n“so far as we know, he has not.”\\n\\n“are you remaining with the expedition, mr. harper?”\\n\\n“no, sir, i am not. i’m for new york as soon as i can square up\\nthings here. you may laugh if you like, but i’m not going to be\\nthis blasted old men-her-ra’s next victim. he’ll get me if i stop\\nhere.”\\n\\nthe young man wiped the perspiration from his brow.\\n\\npoirot turned away. over his shoulder he said with a peculiar\\nsmile:\\n\\n“remember, he got one of his victims in new york.”\\n\\n“oh, hell!” said mr. harper forcibly.\\n\\n“that young man is nervous,” said poirot thoughtfully. “he is on\\nthe edge, but absolutely on the edge.”\\n\\ni glanced at poirot curiously, but his enigmatical smile told me\\nnothing. in company with sir guy willard and dr. tosswill we were\\ntaken round the excavations. the principal finds had been removed\\nto cairo, but some of the tomb furniture was extremely interesting.\\nthe enthusiasm of the young baronet was obvious, but i fancied that\\ni detected a shade of nervousness in his manner as though he could\\nnot quite escape from the feeling of menace in the air. as we\\nentered the tent which had been assigned to us, for a wash before\\njoining the evening meal, a tall dark figure in white robes stood\\naside to let us pass with a graceful gesture and a murmured greeting\\nin arabic. poirot stopped.\\n\\n“you are hassan, the late sir john willard’s servant?”\\n\\n“i served my lord sir john, now i serve his son.” he took a step\\nnearer to us and lowered his voice. “you are a wise one, they say,\\nlearned in dealing with evil spirits. let the young master depart\\nfrom here. there is evil in the air around us.”\\n\\nand with an abrupt gesture, not waiting for a reply, he strode\\naway.\\n\\n“evil in the air,” muttered poirot. “yes, i feel it.”\\n\\nour meal was hardly a cheerful one. the floor was left to dr.\\ntosswill, who discoursed at length upon egyptian antiquities. just\\nas we were preparing to retire to rest, sir guy caught poirot by\\nthe arm and pointed. a shadowy figure was moving amidst the tents.\\nit was no human one: i recognized distinctly the dog-headed figure\\ni had seen carved on the walls of the tomb.\\n\\nmy blood literally froze at the sight.\\n\\n“_mon dieu!_” murmured poirot, crossing himself vigorously. “anubis,\\nthe jackal-headed, the god of departing souls.”\\n\\n“some one is hoaxing us,” cried dr. tosswill, rising indignantly\\nto his feet.\\n\\n“it went into your tent, harper,” muttered sir guy, his face\\ndreadfully pale.\\n\\n“no,” said poirot, shaking his head, “into that of the dr. ames.”\\n\\nthe doctor stared at him incredulously; then, repeating dr.\\ntosswill’s words, he cried:\\n\\n“some one is hoaxing us. come, we’ll soon catch the fellow.”\\n\\nhe dashed energetically in pursuit of the shadowy apparition. i\\nfollowed him, but, search as we would, we could find no trace of\\nany living soul having passed that way. we returned, somewhat\\ndisturbed in mind, to find poirot taking energetic measures, in\\nhis own way, to ensure his personal safety. he was busily\\nsurrounding our tent with various diagrams and inscriptions which\\nhe was drawing in the sand. i recognized the five-pointed star or\\npentagon many times repeated. as was his wont, poirot was at the\\nsame time delivering an impromptu lecture on witchcraft and magic\\nin general, white magic as opposed to black, with various references\\nto the ka and the book of the dead thrown in.\\n\\nit appeared to excite the liveliest contempt in dr. tosswill, who\\ndrew me aside, literally snorting with rage.\\n\\n“balderdash, sir,” he exclaimed angrily. “pure balderdash. the\\nman’s an impostor. he doesn’t know the difference between the\\nsuperstitions of the middle ages and the beliefs of ancient egypt.\\nnever have i heard such a hotch-potch of ignorance and credulity.”\\n\\ni calmed the excited expert, and joined poirot in the tent. my\\nlittle friend was beaming cheerfully.\\n\\n“we can now sleep in peace,” he declared happily. “and i can do\\nwith some sleep. my head, it aches abominably. ah, for a good\\n_tisane_!”\\n\\nas though in answer to prayer, the flap of the tent was lifted and\\nhassan appeared, bearing a steaming cup which he offered to poirot.\\nit proved to be camomile tea, a beverage of which he is inordinately\\nfond. having thanked hassan and refused his offer of another cup\\nfor myself, we were left alone once more. i stood at the door of\\nthe tent some time after undressing, looking out over the desert.\\n\\n“a wonderful place,” i said aloud, “and a wonderful work. i can\\nfeel the fascination. this desert life, this probing into the heart\\nof a vanished civilization. surely, poirot, you, too, must feel\\nthe charm?”\\n\\ni got no answer, and i turned, a little annoyed. my annoyance was\\nquickly changed to concern. poirot was lying back across the rude\\ncouch, his face horribly convulsed. beside him was the empty cup.\\ni rushed to his side, then dashed out and across the camp to dr.\\names’s tent.\\n\\n“dr. ames!” i cried. “come at once.”\\n\\n“what’s the matter?” said the doctor, appearing in pyjamas.\\n\\n“my friend. he’s ill. dying. the camomile tea. don’t let hassan\\nleave the camp.”\\n\\nlike a flash the doctor ran to our tent. poirot was lying as i left\\nhim.\\n\\n“extraordinary,” cried ames. “looks like a seizure—or—what did you\\nsay about something he drank?” he picked up the empty cup.\\n\\n“only i did not drink it!” said a placid voice.\\n\\nwe turned in amazement. poirot was sitting up on the bed. he was\\nsmiling.\\n\\n“no,” he said gently. “i did not drink it. while my good friend\\nhastings was apostrophizing the night, i took the opportunity of\\npouring it, not down my throat, but into a little bottle. that\\nlittle bottle will go to the analytical chemist. no”—as the doctor\\nmade a sudden movement—“as a sensible man, you will understand that\\nviolence will be of no avail. during hastings’ brief absence to\\nfetch you, i have had time to put the bottle in safe keeping. ah,\\nquick, hastings, hold him!”\\n\\ni misunderstood poirot’s anxiety. eager to save my friend, i flung\\nmyself in front of him. but the doctor’s swift movement had another\\nmeaning. his hand went to his mouth, a smell of bitter almonds\\nfilled the air, and he swayed forward and fell.\\n\\n“another victim,” said poirot gravely, “but the last. perhaps it\\nis the best way. he has three deaths on his head.”\\n\\n“dr. ames?” i cried, stupefied. “but i thought you believed in some\\noccult influence?”\\n\\n“you misunderstood me, hastings. what i meant was that i believe\\nin the terrific force of superstition. once get it firmly\\nestablished that a series of deaths are supernatural, and you might\\nalmost stab a man in broad daylight, and it would still be put down\\nto the curse, so strongly is the instinct of the supernatural\\nimplanted in the human race. i suspected from the first that a man\\nwas taking advantage of that instinct. the idea came to him, i\\nimagine, with the death of sir john willard. a fury of superstition\\narose at once. as far as i could see, nobody could derive any\\nparticular profit from sir john’s death. mr. bleibner was a\\ndifferent case. he was a man of great wealth. the information i\\nreceived from new york contained several suggestive points. to\\nbegin with, young bleibner was reported to have said he had a good\\nfriend in egypt from whom he could borrow. it was tacitly understood\\nthat he meant his uncle, but it seemed to me that in that case he\\nwould have said so outright. the words suggest some boon companion\\nof his own. another thing, he scraped up enough money to take him\\nto egypt, his uncle refused outright to advance him a penny, yet\\nhe was able to pay the return passage to new york. some one must\\nhave lent him the money.”\\n\\n“all that was very thin,” i objected.\\n\\n“but there was more. hastings, there occur often enough words\\nspoken metaphorically which are taken literally. the opposite can\\nhappen too. in this case, words which were meant literally were\\ntaken metaphorically. young bleibner wrote plainly enough: ‘i am\\na leper,’ but nobody realized that he shot himself because he\\nbelieved that he had contracted the dread disease of leprosy.”\\n\\n“what?” i ejaculated.\\n\\n“it was the clever invention of a diabolical mind. young bleibner\\nwas suffering from some minor skin trouble, he had lived in the\\nsouth sea islands, where the disease is common enough. ames was a\\nformer friend of his, and a well-known medical man, he would never\\ndream of doubting his word. when i arrived here, my suspicions were\\ndivided between harper and dr. ames, but i soon realized that only\\nthe doctor could have perpetrated and concealed the crimes, and i\\nlearnt from harper that he was previously acquainted with young\\nbleibner. doubtless the latter at some time or another had made a\\nwill or had insured his life in favour of the doctor. the latter\\nsaw his chance of acquiring wealth. it was easy for him to inoculate\\nmr. bleibner with the deadly germs. then the nephew, overcome with\\ndespair at the dread news his friend had conveyed to him, shot\\nhimself. mr. bleibner, whatever his intentions, had made no will.\\nhis fortune would pass to his nephew and from him to the doctor.”\\n\\n“and mr. schneider?”\\n\\n“we cannot be sure. he knew young bleibner too, remember, and may\\nhave suspected something, or, again, the doctor may have thought\\nthat a further death motiveless and purposeless would strengthen\\nthe coils of superstition. furthermore, i will tell you an\\ninteresting psychological fact, hastings. a murderer has always a\\nstrong desire to repeat his successful crime, the performance of\\nit grows upon him. hence my fears for young willard. the figure of\\nanubis you saw to-night was hassan, dressed up by my orders. i\\nwanted to see if i could frighten the doctor. but it would take\\nmore than the supernatural to frighten him. i could see that he\\nwas not entirely taken in by my pretences of belief in the occult.\\nthe little comedy i played for him did not deceive him. i suspected\\nthat he would endeavour to make me the next victim. ah, but in\\nspite of _la mer maudite_, the heat abominable, and the annoyances\\nof the sand, the little grey cells still functioned!”\\n\\npoirot proved to be perfectly right in his premises. young bleibner,\\nsome years ago, in a fit of drunken merriment, had made a jocular\\nwill, leaving “my cigarette case you admire so much and everything\\nelse of which i die possessed which will be principally debts to\\nmy good friend robert ames who once saved my life from drowning.”\\n\\nthe case was hushed up as far as possible, and, to this day, people\\ntalk of the remarkable series of deaths in connection with the tomb\\nof men-her-ra as a triumphal proof of the vengeance of a bygone\\nking upon the desecrators of his tomb—a belief which, as poirot\\npointed out to me, is contrary to all egyptian belief and thought.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  vii\\n\\n  the jewel robbery at the _grand metropolitan_\\n\\n“poirot,” i said, “a change of air would do you good.”\\n\\n“you think so, _mon ami_?”\\n\\n“i am sure of it.”\\n\\n“eh—eh?” said my friend, smiling. “it is all arranged, then?”\\n\\n“you will come?”\\n\\n“where do you propose to take me?”\\n\\n“brighton. as a matter of fact, a friend of mine in the city put\\nme on to a very good thing, and—well, i have money to burn, as the\\nsaying goes. i think a week-end at the _grand metropolitan_ would\\ndo us all the good in the world.”\\n\\n“thank you, i accept most gratefully. you have the good heart to\\nthink of an old man. and the good heart, it is in the end worth\\nall the little grey cells. yes, yes, i who speak to you am in\\ndanger of forgetting that sometimes.”\\n\\ni did not quite relish the implication. i fancy that poirot is\\nsometimes a little inclined to underestimate my mental capacities.\\nbut his pleasure was so evident that i put my slight annoyance\\naside.\\n\\n“then, that’s all right,” i said hastily.\\n\\nsaturday evening saw us dining at the _grand metropolitan_ in the\\nmidst of a gay throng. all the world and his wife seemed to be at\\nbrighton. the dresses were marvellous, and the jewels—worn sometimes\\nwith more love of display than good taste—were something magnificent.\\n\\n“_hein_, it is a sight this!” murmured poirot. “this is the home\\nof the profiteer, is it not so, hastings?”\\n\\n“supposed to be,” i replied. “but we’ll hope they aren’t all tarred\\nwith the profiteering brush.”\\n\\npoirot gazed round him placidly.\\n\\n“the sight of so many jewels makes me wish i had turned my brains\\nto crime, instead of to its detection. what a magnificent\\nopportunity for some thief of distinction! regard, hastings, that\\nstout woman by the pillar. she is, as you would say, plastered with\\ngems.”\\n\\ni followed his eyes.\\n\\n“why,” i exclaimed, “it’s mrs. opalsen.”\\n\\n“you know her?”\\n\\n“slightly. her husband is a rich stockbroker who made a fortune in\\nthe recent oil boom.”\\n\\nafter dinner we ran across the opalsens in the lounge, and i\\nintroduced poirot to them. we chatted for a few minutes, and ended\\nby having our coffee together.\\n\\npoirot said a few words in praise of some of the costlier gems\\ndisplayed on the lady’s ample bosom, and she brightened up at once.\\n\\n“it’s a perfect hobby of mine, mr. poirot. i just _love_ jewellery.\\ned knows my weakness, and every time things go well he brings me\\nsomething new. you are interested in precious stones?”\\n\\n“i have had a good deal to do with them one time and another,\\nmadame. my profession has brought me into contact with some of the\\nmost famous jewels in the world.”\\n\\nhe went on to narrate, with discreet pseudonyms, the story of the\\nhistoric jewels of a reigning house, and mrs. opalsen listened with\\nbated breath.\\n\\n“there now!” she exclaimed, as he ended. “if it isn’t just like a\\nplay! you know, i’ve got some pearls of my own that have a history\\nattached to them. i believe it’s supposed to be one of the finest\\nnecklaces in the world—the pearls are so beautifully matched and\\nso perfect in colour. i declare i really must run up and get it!”\\n\\n“oh, madame,” protested poirot, “you are too amiable. pray do not\\nderange yourself!”\\n\\n“oh, but i’d like to show it to you.”\\n\\nthe buxom dame waddled across to the lift briskly enough. her\\nhusband, who had been talking to me, looked at poirot inquiringly.\\n\\n“madame your wife is so amiable as to insist on showing me her\\npearl necklace,” explained the latter.\\n\\n“oh, the pearls!” opalsen smiled in a satisfied fashion. “well,\\nthey _are_ worth seeing. cost a pretty penny too! still, the\\nmoney’s there all right; i could get what i paid for them any\\nday—perhaps more. may have to, too, if things go on as they are\\nnow. money’s confoundedly tight in the city. all this infernal\\ne.p.d.” he rambled on, launching into technicalities where i could\\nnot follow him.\\n\\nhe was interrupted by a small page-boy who approached and murmured\\nsomething in his ear.\\n\\n“eh—what? i’ll come at once. not taken ill, is she? excuse me,\\ngentlemen.”\\n\\nhe left us abruptly. poirot leaned back and lit one of his tiny\\nrussian cigarettes. then, carefully and meticulously, he arranged\\nthe empty coffee-cups in a neat row, and beamed happily on the\\nresult.\\n\\nthe minutes passed. the opalsens did not return.\\n\\n“curious,” i remarked, at length. “i wonder when they will come\\nback.”\\n\\npoirot watched the ascending spirals of smoke, and then said\\nthoughtfully:\\n\\n“they will not come back.”\\n\\n“why?”\\n\\n“because, my friend, something has happened.”\\n\\n“what sort of thing? how do you know?” i asked curiously.\\n\\npoirot smiled.\\n\\n“a few moments ago the manager came hurriedly out of his office\\nand ran upstairs. he was much agitated. the lift-boy is deep in\\ntalk with one of the pages. the lift-bell has rung three times,\\nbut he heeds it not. thirdly, even the waiters are _distrait_; and\\nto make a waiter _distrait_——” poirot shook his head with an air\\nof finality. “the affair must indeed be of the first magnitude.\\nah, it is as i thought! here come the police.”\\n\\ntwo men had just entered the hotel—one in uniform, the other in\\nplain clothes. they spoke to a page, and were immediately ushered\\nupstairs. a few minutes later, the same boy descended and came up\\nto where we were sitting.\\n\\n“mr. opalsen’s compliments, and would you step upstairs.”\\n\\npoirot sprang nimbly to his feet. one would have said that he\\nawaited the summons. i followed with no less alacrity.\\n\\nthe opalsens’ apartments were situated on the first floor. after\\nknocking on the door, the page-boy retired, and we answered the\\nsummons, “come in!” a strange scene met our eyes. the room was mrs.\\nopalsen’s bedroom, and in the centre of it, lying back in an\\narm-chair, was the lady herself, weeping violently. she presented\\nan extraordinary spectacle, with the tears making great furrows in\\nthe powder with which her complexion was liberally coated. mr.\\nopalsen was striding up and down angrily. the two police officials\\nstood in the middle of the room, one with a notebook in hand. an\\nhotel chambermaid, looking frightened to death, stood by the\\nfire-place; and on the other side of the room a frenchwoman,\\nobviously mrs. opalsen’s maid, was weeping and wringing her hands,\\nwith an intensity of grief that rivalled that of her mistress.\\n\\ninto this pandemonium stepped poirot, neat and smiling. immediately,\\nwith an energy surprising in one of her bulk, mrs. opalsen sprang\\nfrom her chair towards him.\\n\\n“there now; ed may say what he likes, but i believe in luck, i do.\\nit was fated i should meet you the way i did this evening, and i’ve\\na feeling that if you can’t get my pearls back for me nobody can.”\\n\\n“calm yourself, i pray of you, madame.” poirot patted her hand\\nsoothingly. “reassure yourself. all will be well. hercule poirot\\nwill aid you!”\\n\\nmr. opalsen turned to the police inspector.\\n\\n“there will be no objection to my—er—calling in this gentleman, i\\nsuppose?”\\n\\n“none at all, sir,” replied the man civilly, but with complete\\nindifference. “perhaps now your lady’s feeling better she’ll just\\nlet us have the facts?”\\n\\nmrs. opalsen looked helplessly at poirot. he led her back to her\\nchair.\\n\\n“seat yourself, madame, and recount to us the whole history without\\nagitating yourself.”\\n\\nthus abjured, mrs. opalsen dried her eyes gingerly, and began.\\n\\n“i came upstairs after dinner to fetch my pearls for mr. poirot\\nhere to see. the chambermaid and célestine were both in the room\\nas usual——”\\n\\n“excuse me, madame, but what do you mean by ‘as usual’?”\\n\\nmr. opalsen explained.\\n\\n“i make it a rule that no one is to come into this room unless\\ncélestine, the maid, is there also. the chambermaid does the room\\nin the morning while célestine is present, and comes in after\\ndinner to turn down the beds under the same conditions; otherwise\\nshe never enters the room.”\\n\\n“well, as i was saying,” continued mrs. opalsen, “i came up. i went\\nto the drawer here,”—she indicated the bottom right-hand drawer of\\nthe knee-hole dressing-table—“took out my jewel-case and unlocked\\nit. it seemed quite as usual—but the pearls were not there!”\\n\\nthe inspector had been busy with his notebook. “when had you last\\nseen them?” he asked.\\n\\n“they were there when i went down to dinner.”\\n\\n“you are sure?”\\n\\n“quite sure. i was uncertain whether to wear them or not, but in\\nthe end i decided on the emeralds, and put them back in the\\njewel-case.”\\n\\n“who locked up the jewel-case?”\\n\\n“i did. i wear the key on a chain round my neck.” she held it up\\nas she spoke.\\n\\nthe inspector examined it, and shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n“the thief must have had a duplicate key. no difficult matter. the\\nlock is quite a simple one. what did you do after you’d locked the\\njewel-case?”\\n\\n“i put it back in the bottom drawer where i always keep it.”\\n\\n“you didn’t lock the drawer?”\\n\\n“no, i never do. my maid remains in the room till i come up, so\\nthere’s no need.”\\n\\nthe inspector’s face grew graver.\\n\\n“am i to understand that the jewels were there when you went down\\nto dinner, and that since then _the maid has not left the room_?”\\n\\nsuddenly, as though the horror of her own situation for the first\\ntime burst upon her, célestine uttered a piercing shriek, and,\\nflinging herself upon poirot, poured out a torrent of incoherent\\nfrench.\\n\\nthe suggestion was infamous! that she should be suspected of\\nrobbing madame! the police were well known to be of a stupidity\\nincredible! but monsieur, who was a frenchman—\\n\\n“a belgian,” interjected poirot, but célestine paid no attention\\nto the correction.\\n\\nmonsieur would not stand by and see her falsely accused, while that\\ninfamous chambermaid was allowed to go scot-free. she had never\\nliked her—a bold, red-faced thing—a born thief. she had said from\\nthe first that she was not honest. and had kept a sharp watch over\\nher too, when she was doing madame’s room! let those idiots of\\npolicemen search her, and if they did not find madame’s pearls on\\nher it would be very surprising!\\n\\nalthough this harangue was uttered in rapid and virulent french,\\ncélestine had interlarded it with a wealth of gesture, and the\\nchambermaid realized at least a part of her meaning. she reddened\\nangrily.\\n\\n“if that foreign woman’s saying i took the pearls, it’s a lie!”\\nshe declared heatedly. “i never so much as saw them.”\\n\\n“search her!” screamed the other. “you will find it is as i say.”\\n\\n“you’re a liar—do you hear?” said the chambermaid, advancing upon\\nher. “stole ’em yourself, and want to put it on me. why, i was only\\nin the room about three minutes before the lady come up, and then\\nyou were sitting here the whole time, as you always do, like a cat\\nwatching a mouse.”\\n\\nthe inspector looked across inquiringly at célestine. “is that\\ntrue? didn’t you leave the room at all?”\\n\\n“i did not actually leave her alone,” admitted célestine reluctantly,\\n“but i went into my own room through the door here twice—once to\\nfetch a reel of cotton, and once for my scissors. she must have\\ndone it then.”\\n\\n“you wasn’t gone a minute,” retorted the chambermaid angrily. “just\\npopped out and in again. i’d be glad if the police _would_ search\\nme. _i’ve nothing to be afraid of_.”\\n\\nat this moment there was a tap at the door. the inspector went to\\nit. his face brightened when he saw who it was.\\n\\n“ah!” he said. “that’s rather fortunate. i sent for one of our\\nfemale searchers, and she’s just arrived. perhaps if you wouldn’t\\nmind going into the room next door.”\\n\\nhe looked at the chambermaid, who stepped across the threshold with\\na toss of her head, the searcher following her closely.\\n\\nthe french girl had sunk sobbing into a chair. poirot was looking\\nround the room, the main features of which i have made clear by a\\nsketch.\\n\\n[a sketch of the bedroom, adjoining maid's room, and corridor.]\\n\\n“where does that door lead?” he inquired, nodding his head towards\\nthe one by the window.\\n\\n“into the next apartment, i believe,” said the inspector. “it’s\\nbolted, anyway, on this side.”\\n\\npoirot walked across to it, tried it, then drew back the bolt and\\ntried it again.\\n\\n“and on the other side as well,” he remarked. “well, that seems to\\nrule out that.”\\n\\nhe walked over to the windows, examining each of them in turn.\\n\\n“and again—nothing. not even a balcony outside.”\\n\\n“even if there were,” said the inspector impatiently, “i don’t see\\nhow that would help us, if the maid never left the room.”\\n\\n“_évidemment_,” said poirot, not disconcerted. “as mademoiselle is\\npositive she did not leave the room——”\\n\\nhe was interrupted by the reappearance of the chambermaid and the\\npolice searcher.\\n\\n“nothing,” said the latter laconically.\\n\\n“i should hope not, indeed,” said the chambermaid virtuously. “and\\nthat french hussy ought to be ashamed of herself taking away an\\nhonest girl’s character!”\\n\\n“there, there, my girl; that’s all right,” said the inspector,\\nopening the door. “nobody suspects you. you go along and get on\\nwith your work.”\\n\\nthe chambermaid went unwillingly.\\n\\n“going to search _her_?” she demanded, pointing at célestine.\\n\\n“yes, yes!” he shut the door on her and turned the key.\\n\\ncélestine accompanied the searcher into the small room in her turn.\\na few minutes later she also returned. nothing had been found on\\nher.\\n\\nthe inspector’s face grew graver.\\n\\n“i’m afraid i’ll have to ask you to come along with me all the\\nsame, miss.” he turned to mrs. opalsen. “i’m sorry, madam, but all\\nthe evidence points that way. if she’s not got them on her, they’re\\nhidden somewhere about the room.”\\n\\ncélestine uttered a piercing shriek, and clung to poirot’s arm.\\nthe latter bent and whispered something in the girl’s ear. she\\nlooked up at him doubtfully.\\n\\n“_si, si, mon enfant_—i assure you it is better not to resist.”\\nthen he turned to the inspector. “you permit, monsieur? a little\\nexperiment—purely for my own satisfaction.”\\n\\n“depends on what it is,” replied the police officer non-committally.\\n\\npoirot addressed célestine once more.\\n\\n“you have told us that you went into your room to fetch a reel of\\ncotton. whereabouts was it?”\\n\\n“on the top of the chest of drawers, monsieur.”\\n\\n“and the scissors?”\\n\\n“they also.”\\n\\n“would it be troubling you too much, mademoiselle, to ask you to\\nrepeat those two actions? you were sitting here with your work,\\nyou say?”\\n\\ncélestine sat down, and then, at a sign from poirot, rose, passed\\ninto the adjoining room, took up an object from the chest of\\ndrawers, and returned.\\n\\npoirot divided his attention between her movements and a large\\nturnip of a watch which he held in the palm of his hand.\\n\\n“again, if you please, mademoiselle.”\\n\\nat the conclusion of the second performance, he made a note in his\\npocket-book, and returned the watch to his pocket.\\n\\n“thank you, mademoiselle. and you, monsieur,”—he bowed to the\\ninspector—“for your courtesy.”\\n\\nthe inspector seemed somewhat entertained by this excessive\\npoliteness. célestine departed in a flood of tears, accompanied by\\nthe woman and the plain-clothes official.\\n\\nthen, with a brief apology to mrs. opalsen, the inspector set to\\nwork to ransack the room. he pulled out drawers, opened cupboards,\\ncompletely unmade the bed, and tapped the floor. mr. opalsen looked\\non sceptically.\\n\\n“you really think you will find them?”\\n\\n“yes, sir. it stands to reason. she hadn’t time to take them out\\nof the room. the lady’s discovering the robbery so soon upset her\\nplans. no, they’re here right enough. one of the two must have\\nhidden them—and it’s very unlikely for the chambermaid to have done\\nso.”\\n\\n“more than unlikely—impossible!” said poirot quietly.\\n\\n“eh?” the inspector stared.\\n\\npoirot smiled modestly.\\n\\n“i will demonstrate. hastings, my good friend, take my watch in\\nyour hand—with care. it is a family heirloom! just now i timed\\nmademoiselle’s movements—her first absence from the room was of\\ntwelve seconds, her second of fifteen. now observe my actions.\\nmadame will have the kindness to give me the key of the jewel-case.\\ni thank you. my friend hastings will have the kindness to say\\n‘go!’”\\n\\n“go!” i said.\\n\\nwith almost incredible swiftness, poirot wrenched open the drawer\\nof the dressing-table, extracted the jewel-case, fitted the key in\\nthe lock, opened the case, selected a piece of jewellery, shut and\\nlocked the case, and returned it to the drawer, which he pushed to\\nagain. his movements were like lightning.\\n\\n“well, _mon ami_?” he demanded of me breathlessly.\\n\\n“forty-six seconds,” i replied.\\n\\n“you see?” he looked round. “there would not have been time for\\nthe chambermaid even to take the necklace out, far less hide it.”\\n\\n“then that settles it on the maid,” said the inspector with\\nsatisfaction, and returned to his search. he passed into the maid’s\\nbedroom next door.\\n\\npoirot was frowning thoughtfully. suddenly he shot a question at\\nmr. opalsen.\\n\\n“this necklace—it was, without doubt, insured?”\\n\\nmr. opalsen looked a trifle surprised at the question.\\n\\n“yes,” he said hesitatingly, “that is so.”\\n\\n“but what does that matter?” broke in mrs. opalsen tearfully. “it’s\\nmy necklace i want. it was unique. no money could be the same.”\\n\\n“i comprehend, madame,” said poirot soothingly. “i comprehend\\nperfectly. to _la femme_ sentiment is everything—is it not so? but\\nmonsieur, who has not the so fine susceptibility, will doubtless\\nfind some slight consolation in the fact.”\\n\\n“of course, of course,” said mr. opalsen rather uncertainly.\\n“still——”\\n\\nhe was interrupted by a shout of triumph from the inspector. he\\ncame in dangling something from his fingers.\\n\\nwith a cry, mrs. opalsen heaved herself up from her chair. she was\\na changed woman.\\n\\n“oh, oh, my necklace!”\\n\\nshe clasped it to her breast with both hands. we crowded round.\\n\\n“where was it?” demanded opalsen.\\n\\n“maid’s bed. in among the springs of the wire mattress. she must\\nhave stolen it and hidden it there before the chambermaid arrived\\non the scene.”\\n\\n“you permit, madame?” said poirot gently. he took the necklace from\\nher and examined it closely; then handed it back with a bow.\\n\\n“i’m afraid, madam, you’ll have to hand it over to us for the time\\nbeing,” said the inspector. “we shall want it for the charge. but\\nit shall be returned to you as soon as possible.”\\n\\nmr. opalsen frowned.\\n\\n“is that necessary?”\\n\\n“i’m afraid so, sir. just a formality.”\\n\\n“oh, let him take it, ed!” cried his wife. “i’d feel safer if he\\ndid. i shouldn’t sleep a wink thinking some one else might try and\\nget hold of it. that wretched girl! and i would never have believed\\nit of her.”\\n\\n“there, there, my dear, don’t take on so.”\\n\\ni felt a gentle pressure on my arm. it was poirot.\\n\\n“shall we slip away, my friend? i think our services are no longer\\nneeded.”\\n\\nonce outside, however, he hesitated, and then, much to my surprise,\\nhe remarked:\\n\\n“i should rather like to see the room next door.”\\n\\nthe door was not locked, and we entered. the room, which was a\\nlarge double one, was unoccupied. dust lay about rather noticeably,\\nand my sensitive friend gave a characteristic grimace as he ran\\nhis finger round a rectangular mark on a table near the window.\\n\\n“the _service_ leaves to be desired,” he observed dryly.\\n\\nhe was staring thoughtfully out of the window, and seemed to have\\nfallen into a brown study.\\n\\n“well?” i demanded impatiently. “what did we come in here for?”\\n\\nhe started.\\n\\n“_je vous demande pardon, mon ami_. i wished to see if the door\\nwas really bolted on this side also.”\\n\\n“well,” i said, glancing at the door which communicated with the\\nroom we had just left, “it _is_ bolted.”\\n\\npoirot nodded. he still seemed to be thinking.\\n\\n“and, anyway,” i continued, “what does it matter? the case is over.\\ni wish you’d had more chance of distinguishing yourself. but it\\nwas the kind of case that even a stiff-backed idiot like that\\ninspector couldn’t go wrong over.”\\n\\npoirot shook his head.\\n\\n“the case is not over, my friend. it will not be over until we find\\nout who stole the pearls.”\\n\\n“but the maid did!”\\n\\n“why do you say that?”\\n\\n“why,” i stammered, “they were found—actually in her mattress.”\\n\\n“ta, ta, ta!” said poirot impatiently. “those were not the pearls.”\\n\\n“what?”\\n\\n“imitation, _mon ami_.”\\n\\nthe statement took my breath away. poirot was smiling placidly.\\n\\n“the good inspector obviously knows nothing of jewels. but presently\\nthere will be a fine hullabaloo!”\\n\\n“come!” i cried, dragging at his arm.\\n\\n“where?”\\n\\n“we must tell the opalsens at once.”\\n\\n“i think not.”\\n\\n“but that poor woman——”\\n\\n“_eh bien_; that poor woman, as you call her, will have a much\\nbetter night believing the jewels to be safe.”\\n\\n“but the thief may escape with them!”\\n\\n“as usual, my friend, you speak without reflection. how do you know\\nthat the pearls mrs. opalsen locked up so carefully to-night were\\nnot the false ones, and that the real robbery did not take place\\nat a much earlier date?”\\n\\n“oh!” i said, bewildered.\\n\\n“exactly,” said poirot, beaming. “we start again.”\\n\\nhe led the way out of the room, paused a moment as though\\nconsidering, and then walked down to the end of the corridor,\\nstopping outside the small den where the chambermaids and valets\\nof the respective floors congregated. our particular chambermaid\\nappeared to be holding a small court there, and to be retailing\\nher late experiences to an appreciative audience. she stopped in\\nthe middle of a sentence. poirot bowed with his usual politeness.\\n\\n“excuse that i derange you, but i shall be obliged if you will\\nunlock for me the door of mr. opalsen’s room.”\\n\\nthe woman rose willingly, and we accompanied her down the passage\\nagain. mr. opalsen’s room was on the other side of the corridor,\\nits door facing that of his wife’s room. the chambermaid unlocked\\nit with her pass-key, and we entered.\\n\\nas she was about to depart poirot detained her.\\n\\n“one moment; have you ever seen among the effects of mr. opalsen\\na card like this?”\\n\\nhe held out a plain white card, rather highly glazed and uncommon\\nin appearance. the maid took it and scrutinized it carefully.\\n\\n“no, sir, i can’t say i have. but, anyway, the valet has most to\\ndo with the gentlemen’s rooms.”\\n\\n“i see. thank you.”\\n\\npoirot took back the card. the woman departed. poirot appeared to\\nreflect a little. then he gave a short, sharp nod of the head.\\n\\n“ring the bell, i pray of you, hastings. three times, for the\\nvalet.”\\n\\ni obeyed, devoured with curiosity. meanwhile poirot had emptied\\nthe waste-paper-basket on the floor, and was swiftly going through\\nits contents.\\n\\nin a few moments the valet answered the bell. to him poirot put\\nthe same question, and handed him the card to examine. but the\\nresponse was the same. the valet had never seen a card of that\\nparticular quality among mr. opalsen’s belongings. poirot thanked\\nhim, and he withdrew, somewhat unwillingly, with an inquisitive\\nglance at the overturned waste-paper-basket and the litter on the\\nfloor. he could hardly have helped overhearing poirot’s thoughtful\\nremark as he bundled the torn papers back again:\\n\\n“and the necklace was heavily insured. . . .”\\n\\n“poirot,” i cried,  “i see——”\\n\\n“you see nothing, my friend,” he replied quickly. “as usual,\\nnothing at all! it is incredible—but there it is. let us return to\\nour own apartments.”\\n\\nwe did so in silence. once there, to my intense surprise, poirot\\neffected a rapid change of clothing.\\n\\n“i go to london to-night,” he explained. “it is imperative.”\\n\\n“what?”\\n\\n“absolutely. the real work, that of the brain (ah, those brave\\nlittle grey cells), it is done. i go to seek the confirmation. i\\nshall find it! impossible to deceive hercule poirot!”\\n\\n“you’ll come a cropper one of these days,” i observed, rather\\ndisgusted by his vanity.\\n\\n“do not be enraged, i beg of you, _mon ami_. i count on you to do\\nme a service—of your friendship.”\\n\\n“of course,” i said eagerly, rather ashamed of my moroseness. “what\\nis it?”\\n\\n“the sleeve of my coat that i have taken off—will you brush it?\\nsee you, a little white powder has clung to it. you without doubt\\nobserved me run my finger round the drawer of the dressing-table?”\\n\\n“no, i didn’t.”\\n\\n“you should observe my actions, my friend. thus i obtained the\\npowder on my finger, and, being a little over-excited, i rubbed it\\non my sleeve; an action without method which i deplore—false to\\nall my principles.”\\n\\n“but what was the powder?” i asked, not particularly interested in\\npoirot’s principles.\\n\\n“not the poison of the borgias,” replied poirot, with a twinkle.\\n“i see your imagination mounting. i should say it was french\\nchalk.”\\n\\n“french chalk?”\\n\\n“yes, cabinet-makers use it to make drawers run smoothly.”\\n\\ni laughed.\\n\\n“you old sinner! i thought you were working up to something\\nexciting.”\\n\\n“au revoir, my friend. i save myself. i fly!”\\n\\nthe door shut behind him. with a smile, half of derision, half of\\naffection, i picked up the coat, and stretched out my hand for the\\nclothes-brush.\\n\\n\\n  •   •   •   •   •   •   •\\n\\n\\nthe next morning, hearing nothing from poirot, i went out for a\\nstroll, met some old friends, and lunched with them at their hotel.\\nin the afternoon we went for a spin. a punctured tyre delayed us,\\nand it was past eight when i got back to the _grand metropolitan_.\\n\\nthe first sight that met my eyes was poirot, looking even more\\ndiminutive than usual, sandwiched between the opalsens, beaming in\\na state of placid satisfaction.\\n\\n“_mon ami_ hastings!” he cried, and sprang to meet me. “embrace\\nme, my friend; all has marched to a marvel!”\\n\\nluckily, the embrace was merely figurative—not a thing one is\\nalways sure of with poirot.\\n\\n“do you mean——” i began.\\n\\n“just wonderful, i call it!” said mrs. opalsen, smiling all over\\nher fat face. “didn’t i tell you, ed, that if he couldn’t get back\\nmy pearls nobody would?”\\n\\n“you did, my dear, you did. and you were right.”\\n\\ni looked helplessly at poirot, and he answered the glance.\\n\\n“my friend hastings is, as you say in england, all at the seaside.\\nseat yourself, and i will recount to you all the affair that has\\nso happily ended.”\\n\\n“ended?”\\n\\n“but yes. they are arrested.”\\n\\n“who are arrested?”\\n\\n“the chambermaid and the valet, _parbleu_! you did not suspect?\\nnot with my parting hint about the french chalk?”\\n\\n“you said cabinet-makers used it.”\\n\\n“certainly they do—to make drawers slide easily. somebody wanted\\nthat drawer to slide in and out without any noise. who could that\\nbe? obviously, only the chambermaid. the plan was so ingenious that\\nit did not at once leap to the eye—not even to the eye of hercule\\npoirot.\\n\\n“listen, this was how it was done. the valet was in the empty room\\nnext door, waiting. the french maid leaves the room. quick as a\\nflash the chambermaid whips open the drawer, takes out the\\njewel-case, and, slipping back the bolt, passes it through the\\ndoor. the valet opens it at his leisure with the duplicate key with\\nwhich he has provided himself, extracts the necklace, and waits\\nhis time. célestine leaves the room again, and—pst!—in a flash the\\ncase is passed back again and replaced in the drawer.\\n\\n“madame arrives, the theft is discovered. the chambermaid demands\\nto be searched, with a good deal of righteous indignation, and\\nleaves the room without a stain on her character. the imitation\\nnecklace with which they have provided themselves has been concealed\\nin the french girl’s bed that morning by the chambermaid—a master\\nstroke, _ça!_”\\n\\n“but what did you go to london for?”\\n\\n“you remember the card?”\\n\\n“certainly. it puzzled me—and puzzles me still. i thought——”\\n\\ni hesitated delicately, glancing at mr. opalsen.\\n\\npoirot laughed heartily.\\n\\n“_une blague!_ for the benefit of the valet. the card was one with\\na specially prepared surface—for finger-prints. i went straight\\nto scotland yard, asked for our old friend inspector japp, and laid\\nthe facts before him. as i had suspected, the finger-prints proved\\nto be those of two well-known jewel thieves who have been ‘wanted’\\nfor some time. japp came down with me, the thieves were arrested,\\nand the necklace was discovered in the valet’s possession. a clever\\npair, but they failed in _method_. have i not told you, hastings,\\nat least thirty-six times, that without method——”\\n\\n“at least thirty-six thousand times!” i interrupted. “but where\\ndid their ‘method’ break down?”\\n\\n“_mon ami_, it is a good plan to take a place as chambermaid or\\nvalet—but you must not shirk your work. they left an empty room\\nundusted; and therefore, when the man put down the jewel-case on\\nthe little table near the communicating door, it left a square\\nmark——”\\n\\n“i remember,” i cried.\\n\\n“before, i was undecided. then—i _knew_!” there was a moment’s\\nsilence.\\n\\n“and i’ve got my pearls,” said mrs. opalsen as a sort of greek\\nchorus.\\n\\n“well,” i said, “i’d better have some dinner.” poirot accompanied\\nme.\\n\\n“this ought to mean kudos for you,” i observed.\\n\\n“_pas du tout_,” replied poirot tranquilly. “japp and the local\\ninspector will divide the credit between them. but”—he tapped his\\npocket—“i have a cheque here, from mr. opalsen, and, how say you,\\nmy friend? this week-end has not gone according to plan. shall we\\nreturn here next week-end—at my expense this time?”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  viii\\n\\n\\n  the kidnapped prime minister\\n\\n\\nnow that war and the problems of war are things of the past, i\\nthink i may safely venture to reveal to the world the part which\\nmy friend poirot played in a moment of national crisis. the secret\\nhas been well guarded. not a whisper of it reached the press. but,\\nnow that the need for secrecy has gone by, i feel it is only just\\nthat england should know the debt it owes to my quaint little\\nfriend, whose marvellous brain so ably averted a great catastrophe.\\n\\none evening after dinner—i will not particularize the date; it\\nsuffices to say that it was at the time when “peace by negotiation”\\nwas the parrot-cry of england’s enemies—my friend and i were\\nsitting in his rooms. after being invalided out of the army i had\\nbeen given a recruiting job, and it had become my custom to drop\\nin on poirot in the evenings after dinner and talk with him of any\\ncases of interest that he might have on hand.\\n\\ni was attempting to discuss with him the sensational news of that\\nday—no less than an attempted assassination of mr. david macadam,\\nengland’s prime minister. the account in the papers had evidently\\nbeen carefully censored. no details were given, save that the prime\\nminister had had a marvellous escape, the bullet just grazing his\\ncheek.\\n\\ni considered that our police must have been shamefully careless\\nfor such an outrage to be possible. i could well understand that\\nthe german agents in england would be willing to risk much for such\\nan achievement. “fighting mac,” as his own party had nicknamed him,\\nhad strenuously and unequivocally combated the pacifist influence\\nwhich was becoming so prevalent.\\n\\nhe was more than england’s prime minister—he _was_ england; and\\nto have removed him from his sphere of influence would have been\\na crushing and paralysing blow to britain.\\n\\npoirot was busy mopping a grey suit with a minute sponge. never\\nwas there a dandy such as hercule poirot. neatness and order were\\nhis passion. now, with the odour of benzine filling the air, he\\nwas quite unable to give me his full attention.\\n\\n“in a little minute i am with you, my friend. i have all but\\nfinished. the spot of grease—he is not good—i remove him—so!” he\\nwaved his sponge.\\n\\ni smiled as i lit another cigarette.\\n\\n“anything interesting on?” i inquired, after a minute or two.\\n\\n“i assist a—how do you call it?—‘charlady’ to find her husband. a\\ndifficult affair, needing the tact. for i have a little idea that\\nwhen he is found he will not be pleased. what would you? for my\\npart, i sympathize with him. he was a man of discrimination to lose\\nhimself.”\\n\\ni laughed.\\n\\n“at last! the spot of grease, he is gone! i am at your disposal.”\\n\\n“i was asking you what you thought of this attempt to assassinate\\nmacadam?”\\n\\n“_enfantillage!_” replied poirot promptly. “one can hardly take it\\nseriously. to fire with the rifle—never does it succeed. it is a\\ndevice of the past.”\\n\\n“it was very near succeeding this time,” i reminded him.\\n\\npoirot shook his head impatiently. he was about to reply when the\\nlandlady thrust her head round the door and informed him that there\\nwere two gentlemen below who wanted to see him.\\n\\n“they won’t give their names, sir, but they says as it’s very\\nimportant.”\\n\\n“let them mount,” said poirot, carefully folding his grey trousers.\\n\\nin a few minutes the two visitors were ushered in, and my heart\\ngave a leap as in the foremost i recognized no less a personage\\nthan lord estair, leader of the house of commons; whilst his\\ncompanion, mr. bernard dodge, was also a member of the war cabinet,\\nand, as i knew, a close personal friend of the prime minister.\\n\\n“monsieur poirot?” said lord estair interrogatively. my friend\\nbowed. the great man looked at me and hesitated. “my business is\\nprivate.”\\n\\n“you may speak freely before captain hastings,” said my friend,\\nnodding to me to remain. “he has not all the gifts, no! but i\\nanswer for his discretion.”\\n\\nlord estair still hesitated, but mr. dodge broke in abruptly:\\n\\n“oh, come on—don’t let’s beat about the bush! as far as i can see,\\nthe whole of england will know the hole we’re in soon enough.\\ntime’s everything.”\\n\\n“pray be seated, messieurs,” said poirot politely. “will you take\\nthe big chair, _milord_?”\\n\\nlord estair started slightly. “you know me?”\\n\\npoirot smiled. “certainly. i read the little papers with the\\npictures. how should i not know you?”\\n\\n“monsieur poirot, i have come to consult you upon a matter of the\\nmost vital urgency. i must ask for absolute secrecy.”\\n\\n“you have the word of hercule poirot—i can say no more!” said my\\nfriend grandiloquently.\\n\\n“it concerns the prime minister. we are in grave trouble.”\\n\\n“we’re up a tree!” interposed mr. dodge.\\n\\n“the injury is serious, then?” i asked.\\n\\n“what injury?”\\n\\n“the bullet wound.”\\n\\n“oh, that!” cried mr. dodge contemptuously. “that’s old history.”\\n\\n“as my colleague says,” continued lord estair, “that affair is over\\nand done with. luckily, it failed. i wished i could say as much\\nfor the second attempt.”\\n\\n“there has been a second attempt, then?”\\n\\n“yes, though not of the same nature. monsieur poirot, the prime\\nminister has disappeared.”\\n\\n“what?”\\n\\n“he has been kidnapped!”\\n\\n“impossible!” i cried, stupefied.\\n\\npoirot threw a withering glance at me, which i knew enjoined me to\\nkeep my mouth shut.\\n\\n“unfortunately, impossible as it seems, it is only too true,”\\ncontinued his lordship.\\n\\npoirot looked at mr. dodge. “you said just now, monsieur, that time\\nwas everything. what did you mean by that?”\\n\\nthe two men exchanged glances, and then lord estair said:\\n\\n“you have heard, monsieur poirot, of the approaching allied\\nconference?”\\n\\nmy friend nodded.\\n\\n“for obvious reasons, no details have been given of when and where\\nit is to take place. but, although it has been kept out of the\\nnewspapers, the date is, of course, widely known in diplomatic\\ncircles. the conference is to be held to-morrow—thursday—evening\\nat versailles. now you perceive the terrible gravity of the\\nsituation. i will not conceal from you that the prime minister’s\\npresence at the conference is a vital necessity. the pacifist\\npropaganda, started and maintained by the german agents in our\\nmidst, has been very active. it is the universal opinion that the\\nturning point of the conference will be the strong personality of\\nthe prime minister. his absence may have the most serious\\nresults—possibly a premature and disastrous peace. and we have no\\none who can be sent in his place. he alone can represent england.”\\n\\npoirot’s face had grown very grave. “then you regard the kidnapping\\nof the prime minister as a direct attempt to prevent his being\\npresent at the conference?”\\n\\n“most certainly i do. he was actually on his way to france at the\\ntime.”\\n\\n“and the conference is to be held?”\\n\\n“at nine o’clock to-morrow night.”\\n\\npoirot drew an enormous watch from his pocket.\\n\\n“it is now a quarter to nine.”\\n\\n“twenty-four hours,” said mr. dodge thoughtfully.\\n\\n“and a quarter,” amended poirot. “do not forget the quarter,\\nmonsieur—it may come in useful. now for the details—the abduction,\\ndid it take place in england or in france?”\\n\\n“in france. mr. macadam crossed to france this morning. he was to\\nstay to-night as the guest of the commander-in-chief, proceeding\\nto-morrow to paris. he was conveyed across the channel by destroyer.\\nat boulogne he was met by a car from general headquarters and one\\nof the commander-in-chief’s a.d.c.s.”\\n\\n“_eh bien_?”\\n\\n“well, they started from boulogne—but they never arrived.”\\n\\n“what?”\\n\\n“monsieur poirot, it was a bogus car and a bogus a.d.c. the real\\ncar was found in a side road, with the chauffeur and the a.d.c.\\nneatly gagged and bound.”\\n\\n“and the bogus car?”\\n\\n“is still at large.”\\n\\npoirot made a gesture of impatience. “incredible! surely it cannot\\nescape attention for long?”\\n\\n“so we thought. it seemed merely a question of searching thoroughly.\\nthat part of france is under military law. we were convinced that\\nthe car could not go long unnoticed. the french police and our own\\nscotland yard men, and the military are straining every nerve. it\\nis, as you say, incredible—but nothing has been discovered!”\\n\\nat that moment a tap came at the door, and a young officer entered\\nwith a heavily sealed envelope which he handed to lord estair.\\n\\n“just through from france, sir. i brought it on here, as you\\ndirected.”\\n\\nthe minister tore it open eagerly, and uttered an exclamation. the\\nofficer withdrew.\\n\\n“here is news at last! this telegram has just been decoded. they\\nhave found the second car, also the secretary, daniels, chloroformed,\\ngagged, and bound, in an abandoned farm near c——. he remembers\\nnothing, except something being pressed against his mouth and nose\\nfrom behind, and struggling to free himself. the police are\\nsatisfied as to the genuineness of his statement.”\\n\\n“and they have found nothing else?”\\n\\n“no.”\\n\\n“not the prime minister’s dead body? then, there is hope. but it\\nis strange. why, after trying to shoot him this morning, are they\\nnow taking so much trouble to keep him alive?”\\n\\ndodge shook his head. “one thing’s quite certain. they’re determined\\nat all costs to prevent his attending the conference.”\\n\\n“if it is humanly possible, the prime minister shall be there. god\\ngrant it is not too late. now, messieurs, recount to me\\neverything—from the beginning. i must know about this shooting\\naffair as well.”\\n\\n“last night, the prime minister, accompanied by one of his\\nsecretaries, captain daniels——”\\n\\n“the same who accompanied him to france?”\\n\\n“yes. as i was saying, they motored down to windsor, where the\\nprime minister was granted an audience. early this morning, he\\nreturned to town, and it was on the way that the attempted\\nassassination took place.”\\n\\n“one moment, if you please. who is this captain daniels? you have\\nhis dossier?”\\n\\nlord estair smiled. “i thought you would ask me that. we do not\\nknow very much of him. he is of no particular family. he has served\\nin the english army, and is an extremely able secretary, being an\\nexceptionally fine linguist. i believe he speaks seven languages.\\nit is for that reason that the prime minister chose him to accompany\\nhim to france.”\\n\\n“has he any relatives in england?”\\n\\n“two aunts. a mrs. everard, who lives at hampstead, and a miss\\ndaniels, who lives near ascot.”\\n\\n“ascot? that is near to windsor, is it not?”\\n\\n“that point has not been overlooked. but it has led to nothing.”\\n\\n“you regard the capitaine daniels, then, as above suspicion?”\\n\\na shade of bitterness crept into lord estair’s voice, as he replied:\\n\\n“no, monsieur poirot. in these days, i should hesitate before i\\npronounced _anyone_ above suspicion.”\\n\\n“_très bien_. now i understand, _milord_, that the prime minister\\nwould, as a matter of course, be under vigilant police protection,\\nwhich ought to render any assault upon him an impossibility?”\\n\\nlord estair bowed his head. “that is so. the prime minister’s car\\nwas closely followed by another car containing detectives in plain\\nclothes. mr. macadam knew nothing of these precautions. he is\\npersonally a most fearless man, and would be inclined to sweep them\\naway arbitrarily. but, naturally, the police make their own\\narrangements. in fact, the premier’s chauffeur, o’murphy, is a\\nc.i.d. man.”\\n\\n“o’murphy? that is a name of ireland, is it not so?”\\n\\n“yes, he is an irishman.”\\n\\n“from what part of ireland?”\\n\\n“county clare, i believe.”\\n\\n“_tiens!_ but proceed, _milord_.”\\n\\n“the premier started for london. the car was a closed one. he and\\ncaptain daniels sat inside. the second car followed as usual. but,\\nunluckily, for some unknown reason, the prime minister’s car\\ndeviated from the main road——”\\n\\n“at a point where the road curves?” interrupted poirot.\\n\\n“yes—but how did you know?”\\n\\n“oh, _c’est évident_! continue!”\\n\\n“for some unknown reason,” continued lord estair, “the premier’s\\ncar left the main road. the police car, unaware of the deviation,\\ncontinued to keep to the high road. at a short distance down the\\nunfrequented lane, the prime minister’s car was suddenly held up\\nby a band of masked men. the chauffeur——”\\n\\n“that brave o’murphy!” murmured poirot thoughtfully.\\n\\n“the chauffeur, momentarily taken aback, jammed on the brakes. the\\nprime minister put his head out of the window. instantly a shot\\nrang out—then another. the first one grazed his cheek, the second,\\nfortunately, went wide. the chauffeur, now realizing the danger,\\ninstantly forged straight ahead, scattering the band of men.”\\n\\n“a near escape,” i ejaculated, with a shiver.\\n\\n“mr. macadam refused to make any fuss over the slight wound he had\\nreceived. he declared it was only a scratch. he stopped at a local\\ncottage hospital, where it was dressed and bound up—he did not, of\\ncourse, reveal his identity. he then drove, as per schedule,\\nstraight to charing cross, where a special train for dover was\\nawaiting him, and, after a brief account of what had happened had\\nbeen given to the anxious police by captain daniels, he duly\\ndeparted for france. at dover, he went on board the waiting\\ndestroyer. at boulogne, as you know, the bogus car was waiting for\\nhim, carrying the union jack, and correct in every detail.”\\n\\n“that is all you have to tell me?”\\n\\n“yes.”\\n\\n“there is no other circumstance that you have omitted, milord?”\\n\\n“well, there is one rather peculiar thing.”\\n\\n“yes?”\\n\\n“the prime minister’s car did not return home after leaving the\\nprime minister at charing cross. the police were anxious to\\ninterview o’murphy, so a search was instituted at once. the car\\nwas discovered standing outside a certain unsavoury little\\nrestaurant in soho, which is well known as a meeting-place of\\ngerman agents.”\\n\\n“and the chauffeur?”\\n\\n“the chauffeur was nowhere to be found. he, too, had disappeared.”\\n\\n“so,” said poirot thoughtfully, “there are two disappearances: the\\nprime minister in france, and o’murphy in london.”\\n\\nhe looked keenly at lord estair, who made a gesture of despair.\\n\\n“i can only tell you, monsieur poirot, that, if anyone had suggested\\nto me yesterday that o’murphy was a traitor, i should have laughed\\nin his face.”\\n\\n“and to-day?”\\n\\n“to-day i do not know what to think.”\\n\\npoirot nodded gravely. he looked at his turnip of a watch again.\\n\\n“i understand that i have carte blanche, messieurs—in every way,\\ni mean? i must be able to go where i choose, and how i choose.”\\n\\n“perfectly. there is a special train leaving for dover in an hour’s\\ntime, with a further contingent from scotland yard. you shall be\\naccompanied by a military officer and a c.i.d. man, who will hold\\nthemselves at your disposal in every way. is that satisfactory?”\\n\\n“quite. one more question before you leave, messieurs. what made\\nyou come to me? i am unknown, obscure, in this great london of\\nyours.”\\n\\n“we sought you out on the express recommendation and wish of a very\\ngreat man of your own country.”\\n\\n“_comment?_ my old friend the _préfet_——?”\\n\\nlord estair shook his head.\\n\\n“one higher than the _préfet_. one whose word was once law in\\nbelgium—and shall be again! that england has sworn!”\\n\\npoirot’s hand flew swiftly to a dramatic salute. “amen to that!\\nah, but my master does not forget. . . . messieurs, i, hercule\\npoirot, will serve you faithfully. heaven only send that it will\\nbe in time. but this is dark—dark. . . . i cannot see.”\\n\\n“well, poirot,” i cried impatiently, as the door closed behind the\\nministers, “what do you think?”\\n\\nmy friend was busy packing a minute suitcase, with quick, deft\\nmovements. he shook his head thoughtfully.\\n\\n“i do not know what to think. my brains desert me.”\\n\\n“why, as you said, kidnap him, when a knock on the head would do\\nas well?” i mused.\\n\\n“pardon me, _mon ami_, but i did not quite say that. it is\\nundoubtedly far more their affair to kidnap him.”\\n\\n“but why?”\\n\\n“because uncertainty creates panic. that is one reason. were the\\nprime minister dead, it would be a terrible calamity, but the\\nsituation would have to be faced. but now you have paralysis. will\\nthe prime minister reappear, or will he not? is he dead or alive?\\nnobody knows, and until they know nothing definite can be done.\\nand, as i tell you, uncertainty breeds panic, which is what _les\\nboches_ are playing for. then, again, if the kidnappers are holding\\nhim secretly somewhere, they have the advantage of being able to\\nmake terms with both sides. the german government is not a liberal\\npaymaster, as a rule, but no doubt they can be made to disgorge\\nsubstantial remittances in such a case as this. thirdly, they run\\nno risk of the hangman’s rope. oh, decidedly, kidnapping is their\\naffair.”\\n\\n“then, if that is so, why should they first try to shoot him?”\\n\\npoirot made a gesture of anger. “ah, that is just what i do not\\nunderstand! it is inexplicable—stupid! they have all their\\narrangements made (and very good arrangements too!) for the\\nabduction, and yet they imperil the whole affair by a melodramatic\\nattack, worthy of a cinema, and quite as unreal. it is almost\\nimpossible to believe in it, with its band of masked men, not\\ntwenty miles from london!”\\n\\n“perhaps they were two quite separate attempts which happened\\nirrespective of each other,” i suggested.\\n\\n“ah, no, that would be too much of a coincidence! then, further—who\\nis the traitor? there must have been a traitor—in the first affair,\\nanyway. but who was it—daniels or o’murphy? it must have been one\\nof the two, or why did the car leave the main road? we cannot\\nsuppose that the prime minister connived at his own assassination!\\ndid o’murphy take that turning of his own accord, or was it daniels\\nwho told him to do so?”\\n\\n“surely it must have been o’murphy’s doing.”\\n\\n“yes, because if it was daniels’ the prime minister would have\\nheard the order, and would have asked the reason. but there are\\naltogether too many ‘whys’ in this affair, and they contradict each\\nother. if o’murphy is an honest man, _why_ did he leave the main\\nroad? but if he was a dishonest man, _why_ did he start the car\\nagain when only two shots had been fired—thereby, in all probability,\\nsaving the prime minister’s life? and, again, if he was honest,\\nwhy did he, immediately on leaving charing cross, drive to a\\nwell-known rendezvous of german spies?”\\n\\n“it looks bad,” i said.\\n\\n“let us look at the case with method. what have we for and against\\nthese two men? take o’murphy first. against: that his conduct in\\nleaving the main road was suspicious; that he is an irishman from\\ncounty clare; that he has disappeared in a highly suggestive\\nmanner. for: that his promptness in restarting the car saved the\\npremier’s life; that he is a scotland yard man, and, obviously,\\nfrom the post allotted to him, a trusted detective. now for daniels.\\nthere is not much against him, except the fact that nothing is\\nknown of his antecedents, and that he speaks too many languages\\nfor a good englishman! (pardon me, _mon ami_, but, as linguists,\\nyou are deplorable!) _now for him_, we have the fact that he was\\nfound gagged, bound, and chloroformed—which does not look as though\\nhe had anything to do with the matter.”\\n\\n“he might have gagged and bound himself, to divert suspicion.”\\n\\npoirot shook his head. “the french police would make no mistake of\\nthat kind. besides, once he had attained his object, and the prime\\nminister was safely abducted, there would not be much point in his\\nremaining behind. his accomplices _could_ have gagged and\\nchloroformed him, of course, but i fail to see what object they\\nhoped to accomplish by it. he can be of little use to them now,\\nfor, until the circumstances concerning the prime minister have\\nbeen cleared up, he is bound to be closely watched.”\\n\\n“perhaps he hoped to start the police on a false scent?”\\n\\n“then why did he not do so? he merely says that something was\\npressed over his nose and mouth, and that he remembers nothing\\nmore. there is no false scent there. it sounds remarkably like the\\ntruth.”\\n\\n“well,” i said, glancing at the clock, “i suppose we’d better start\\nfor the station. you may find more clues in france.”\\n\\n“possibly, _mon ami_, but i doubt it. it is still incredible to me\\nthat the prime minister has not been discovered in that limited\\narea, where the difficulty of concealing him must be tremendous.\\nif the military and the police of two countries have not found him,\\nhow shall i?”\\n\\nat charing cross we were met by mr. dodge.\\n\\n“this is detective barnes, of scotland yard, and major norman. they\\nwill hold themselves entirely at your disposal. good luck to you.\\nit’s a bad business, but i’ve not given up hope. must be off now.”\\nand the minister strode rapidly away.\\n\\nwe chatted in a desultory fashion with major norman. in the centre\\nof the little group of men on the platform i recognized a little\\nferret-faced fellow talking to a tall, fair man. he was an old\\nacquaintance of poirot’s—detective-inspector japp, supposed to be\\none of the smartest of scotland yard’s officers. he came over and\\ngreeted my friend cheerfully.\\n\\n“i heard you were on this job too. smart bit of work. so far\\nthey’ve got away with the goods all right. but i can’t believe they\\ncan keep him hidden long. our people are going through france with\\na toothcomb. so are the french. i can’t help feeling it’s only a\\nmatter of hours now.”\\n\\n“that is, if he’s still alive,” remarked the tall detective\\ngloomily.\\n\\njapp’s face fell. “yes. . . . but somehow i’ve got the feeling he’s\\nalive all right.”\\n\\npoirot nodded. “yes, yes; he’s alive. but can he be found in time?\\ni, like you, did not believe he could be hidden so long.”\\n\\nthe whistle blew, and we all trooped up into the pullman car. then,\\nwith a slow, unwilling jerk, the train drew out of the station.\\n\\nit was a curious journey. the scotland yard men crowded together.\\nmaps of northern france were spread out, and eager forefingers\\ntraced the lines of roads and villages. each man had his own pet\\ntheory. poirot showed none of his usual loquacity, but sat staring\\nin front of him, with an expression on his face that reminded me\\nof a puzzled child. i talked to norman, whom i found quite an\\namusing fellow. on arriving at dover poirot’s behaviour moved me\\nto intense amusement. the little man, as he went on board the boat,\\nclutched desperately at my arm. the wind was blowing lustily.\\n\\n“_mon dieu!_” he murmured. “this is terrible!”\\n\\n“have courage, poirot,” i cried. “you will succeed. you will find\\nhim. i am sure of it.”\\n\\n“ah, _mon ami_, you mistake my emotion. it is this villainous sea\\nthat troubles me! the _mal de mer_—it is horrible suffering!”\\n\\n“oh!” i said, rather taken aback.\\n\\nthe first throb of the engines was felt, and poirot groaned and\\nclosed his eyes.\\n\\n“major norman has a map of northern france if you would like to\\nstudy it?”\\n\\npoirot shook his head impatiently.\\n\\n“but no, but no! leave me, my friend. see you, to think, the\\nstomach and the brain must be in harmony. laverguier has a method\\nmost excellent for averting the _mal de mer_. you breathe in—and\\nout—slowly, so—turning the head from left to right and counting\\nsix between each breath.”\\n\\ni left him to his gymnastic endeavours, and went on deck.\\n\\nas we came slowly into boulogne harbour poirot appeared, neat and\\nsmiling, and announced to me in a whisper that laverguier’s system\\nhad succeeded “to a marvel!”\\n\\njapp’s forefinger was still tracing imaginary routes on his map.\\n“nonsense! the car started from boulogne—here they branched off.\\nnow, my idea is that they transferred the prime minister to another\\ncar. see?”\\n\\n“well,” said the tall detective, “i shall make for the seaports.\\nten to one, they’ve smuggled him on board a ship.”\\n\\njapp shook his head. “too obvious. the order went out at once to\\nclose all the ports.”\\n\\nthe day was just breaking as we landed. major norman touched poirot\\non the arm. “there’s a military car here waiting for you, sir.”\\n\\n“thank you, monsieur. but, for the moment, i do not propose to\\nleave boulogne.”\\n\\n“what?”\\n\\n“no, we will enter this hotel here, by the quay.”\\n\\nhe suited the action to the word, demanded and was accorded a\\nprivate room. we three followed him, puzzled and uncomprehending.\\n\\nhe shot a quick glance at us. “it is not so that the good detective\\nshould act, eh? i perceive your thought. he must be full of energy.\\nhe must rush to and fro. he should prostrate himself on the dusty\\nroad and seek the marks of tyres through a little glass. he must\\ngather up the cigarette-end, the fallen match? that is your idea,\\nis it not?”\\n\\nhis eyes challenged us. “but i—hercule poirot—tell you that it is\\nnot so! the true clues are within—_here_!” he tapped his forehead.\\n“see you, i need not have left london. it would have been sufficient\\nfor me to sit quietly in my rooms there. all that matters is the\\nlittle grey cells within. secretly and silently they do their part,\\nuntil suddenly i call for a map, and i lay my finger on a\\nspot—so—and i say: the prime minister is _there_! and it is so!\\nwith method and logic one can accomplish anything! this frantic\\nrushing to france was a mistake—it is playing a child’s game of\\nhide-and-seek. but now, though it may be too late, i will set to\\nwork the right way, from within. silence, my friends, i beg of\\nyou.”\\n\\nand for five long hours the little man sat motionless, blinking\\nhis eyelids like a cat, his green eyes flickering and becoming\\nsteadily greener and greener. the scotland yard man was obviously\\ncontemptuous, major norman was bored and impatient, and i myself\\nfound the time pass with wearisome slowness.\\n\\nfinally, i got up, and strolled as noiselessly as i could to the\\nwindow. the matter was becoming a farce. i was secretly concerned\\nfor my friend. if he failed, i would have preferred him to fail in\\na less ridiculous manner. out of the window i idly watched the\\ndaily leave boat, belching forth columns of smoke, as she lay\\nalongside the quay.\\n\\nsuddenly i was aroused by poirot’s voice close to my elbow.\\n\\n“_mes amis_, let us start!”\\n\\ni turned. an extraordinary transformation had come over my friend.\\nhis eyes were flickering with excitement, his chest was swelled to\\nthe uttermost.\\n\\n“i have been an imbecile, my friends! but i see daylight at last.”\\n\\nmajor norman moved hastily to the door. “i’ll order the car.”\\n\\n“there is no need. i shall not use it. thank heaven the wind has\\nfallen.”\\n\\n“do you mean you are going to walk, sir?”\\n\\n“no, my young friend. i am no st. peter. i prefer to cross the sea\\nby boat.”\\n\\n“to cross the _sea_?”\\n\\n“yes. to work with method, one must begin from the beginning. and\\nthe beginning of this affair was in england. therefore, we return\\nto england.”\\n\\n\\n  •   •   •   •   •   •   •\\n\\n\\nat three o’clock, we stood once more upon charing cross platform.\\nto all our expostulations, poirot turned a deaf ear, and reiterated\\nagain and again that to start at the beginning was not a waste of\\ntime, but the only way. on the way over, he had conferred with\\nnorman in a low voice, and the latter had despatched a sheaf of\\ntelegrams from dover.\\n\\nowing to the special passes held by norman, we got through\\neverywhere in record time. in london, a large police car was\\nwaiting for us, with some plain-clothes men, one of whom handed a\\ntypewritten sheet of paper to my friend. he answered my inquiring\\nglance.\\n\\n“a list of the cottage hospitals within a certain radius west of\\nlondon. i wired for it from dover.”\\n\\nwe were whirled rapidly through the london streets. we were on the\\nbath road. on we went, through hammersmith, chiswick and brentford.\\ni began to see our objective. through windsor and on to ascot. my\\nheart gave a leap. ascot was where daniels had an aunt living. we\\nwere after _him_, then, not o’murphy.\\n\\nwe duly stopped at the gate of a trim villa. poirot jumped out and\\nrang the bell. i saw a perplexed frown dimming the radiance of his\\nface. plainly, he was not satisfied. the bell was answered. he was\\nushered inside. in a few moments he reappeared, and climbed into\\nthe car with a short, sharp shake of his head. my hopes began to\\ndie down. it was past four now. even if he found certain evidence\\nincriminating daniels, what would be the good of it, unless he\\ncould wring from some one the exact spot in france where they were\\nholding the prime minister?\\n\\nour return progress towards london was an interrupted one. we\\ndeviated from the main road more than once, and occasionally\\nstopped at a small building, which i had no difficulty in\\nrecognizing as a cottage hospital. poirot only spent a few minutes\\nat each, but at every halt his radiant assurance was more and more\\nrestored.\\n\\nhe whispered something to norman, to which the latter replied:\\n\\n“yes, if you turn off to the left, you will find them waiting by\\nthe bridge.”\\n\\nwe turned up a side road, and in the failing light i discerned a\\nsecond car, waiting by the side of the road. it contained two men\\nin plain clothes. poirot got down and spoke to them, and then we\\nstarted off in a northerly direction, the other car following close\\nbehind.\\n\\nwe drove for some time, our objective being obviously one of the\\nnorthern suburbs of london. finally, we drove up to the front door\\nof a tall house, standing a little back from the road in its own\\ngrounds.\\n\\nnorman and i were left with the car. poirot and one of the\\ndetectives went up to the door and rang. a neat parlourmaid opened\\nit. the detective spoke.\\n\\n“i am a police officer, and i have a warrant to search this house.”\\n\\nthe girl gave a little scream, and a tall, handsome woman of\\nmiddle-age appeared behind her in the hall.\\n\\n“shut the door, edith. they are burglars, i expect.”\\n\\nbut poirot swiftly inserted his foot in the door, and at the same\\nmoment blew a whistle. instantly the other detectives ran up, and\\npoured into the house, shutting the door behind them.\\n\\nnorman and i spent about five minutes cursing our forced inactivity.\\nfinally the door reopened, and the men emerged, escorting three\\nprisoners—a woman and two men. the woman, and one of the men, were\\ntaken to the second car. the other man was placed in our car by\\npoirot himself.\\n\\n“i must go with the others, my friend. but have great care of this\\ngentleman. you do not know him, no? _eh bien_, let me present to\\nyou, monsieur o’murphy!”\\n\\no’murphy! i _gaped_ at him open-mouthed as we started again. he\\nwas not handcuffed, but i did not fancy he would try to escape. he\\nsat there staring in front of him as though dazed. anyway, norman\\nand i would be more than a match for him.\\n\\nto my surprise, we still kept a northerly route. we were not\\nreturning to london, then! i was much puzzled. suddenly, as the\\ncar slowed down, i recognized that we were close to hendon\\naerodrome. immediately i grasped poirot’s idea. he proposed to\\nreach france by aeroplane.\\n\\nit was a sporting idea, but, on the face of it, impracticable. a\\ntelegram would be far quicker. time was everything. he must leave\\nthe personal glory of rescuing the prime minister to others.\\n\\nas we drew up, major norman jumped out, and a plain-clothes man\\ntook his place. he conferred with poirot for a few minutes, and\\nthen went off briskly.\\n\\ni, too, jumped out, and caught poirot by the arm.\\n\\n“i congratulate you, old fellow! they have told you the hiding-place?\\nbut, look here, you must wire to france at once. you’ll be too late\\nif you go yourself.”\\n\\npoirot looked at me curiously for a minute or two.\\n\\n“unfortunately, my friend, there are some things that cannot be\\nsent by telegram.”\\n\\n\\n  •   •   •   •   •   •   •\\n\\n\\nat that moment major norman returned, accompanied by a young\\nofficer in the uniform of the flying corps.\\n\\n“this is captain lyall, who will fly you over to france. he can\\nstart at once.”\\n\\n“wrap up warmly, sir,” said the young pilot. “i can lend you a\\ncoat, if you like.”\\n\\npoirot was consulting his enormous watch. he murmured to himself:\\n“yes, there is time—just time.” then he looked up, and bowed\\npolitely to the young officer. “i thank you, monsieur. but it is\\nnot i who am your passenger. it is this gentleman here.”\\n\\nhe moved a little aside as he spoke, and a figure came forward out\\nof the darkness. it was the second male prisoner who had gone in\\nthe other car, and as the light fell on his face, i gave a gasp of\\nsurprise.\\n\\n_it was the prime minister!_\\n\\n\\n  •   •   •   •   •   •   •\\n\\n\\n“for heaven’s sake, tell me all about it,” i cried impatiently, as\\npoirot, norman, and i motored back to london. “how in the world\\ndid they manage to smuggle him back to england?”\\n\\n“there was no need to smuggle him back,” replied poirot dryly. “the\\nprime minister has never left england. he was kidnapped on his way\\nfrom windsor to london.”\\n\\n“what?”\\n\\n“i will make all clear. the prime minister was in his car, his\\nsecretary beside him. suddenly a pad of chloroform is clapped on\\nhis face——”\\n\\n“but by whom?”\\n\\n“by the clever linguistic captain daniels. as soon as the prime\\nminister is unconscious, daniels picks up the speaking-tube, and\\ndirects o’murphy to turn to the right, which the chauffeur, quite\\nunsuspicious, does. a few yards down that unfrequented road, a\\nlarge car is standing, apparently broken down. its driver signals\\nto o’murphy to stop. o’murphy slows up. the stranger approaches.\\ndaniels leans out of the window, and, probably with the aid of an\\ninstantaneous anæsthetic, such as ethylchloride, the chloroform\\ntrick is repeated. in a few seconds, the two helpless men are\\ndragged out and transferred to the other car, and a pair of\\nsubstitutes take their places.”\\n\\n“impossible!”\\n\\n“_pas du tout!_ have you not seen music-hall turns imitating\\ncelebrities with marvellous accuracy? nothing is easier than to\\npersonate a public character. the prime minister of england is far\\neasier to understudy than mr. john smith of clapham, say. as for\\no’murphy’s ‘double,’ no one was going to take much notice of him\\nuntil after the departure of the prime minister, and by then he\\nwould have made himself scarce. he drives straight from charing\\ncross to the meeting-place of his friends. he goes in as o’murphy,\\nhe emerges as some one quite different. o’murphy has disappeared,\\nleaving a conveniently suspicious trail behind him.”\\n\\n“but the man who personated the prime minister was seen by every\\none!”\\n\\n“he was not seen by anyone who knew him privately or intimately.\\nand daniels shielded him from contact with anyone as much as\\npossible. moreover, his face was bandaged up, and anything unusual\\nin his manner would be put down to the fact that he was suffering\\nfrom shock as a result of the attempt upon his life. mr. macadam\\nhas a weak throat, and always spares his voice as much as possible\\nbefore any great speech. the deception was perfectly easy to keep\\nup as far as france. there it would be impracticable and\\nimpossible—so the prime minister disappears. the police of this\\ncountry hurry across the channel, and no one bothers to go into\\nthe details of the first attack. to sustain the illusion that the\\nabduction has taken place in france, daniels is gagged and\\nchloroformed in a convincing manner.”\\n\\n“and the man who has enacted the part of the prime minister?”\\n\\n“rids himself of his disguise. he and the bogus chauffeur may be\\narrested as suspicious characters, but no one will dream of\\nsuspecting their real part in the drama, and they will eventually\\nbe released for lack of evidence.”\\n\\n“and the real prime minister?”\\n\\n“he and o’murphy were driven straight to the house of ‘mrs.\\neverard,’ at hampstead, daniels’ so-called ‘aunt.’ in reality, she\\nis frau bertha ebenthal, and the police have been looking for her\\nfor some time. it is a valuable little present that i have made to\\nthem—to say nothing of daniels! ah, it was a clever plan, but he\\ndid not reckon on the cleverness of hercule poirot!”\\n\\ni think my friend might well be excused his moment of vanity.\\n\\n“when did you first begin to suspect the truth of the matter?”\\n\\n“when i began to work the right way—from _within_! i could not make\\nthat shooting affair fit in—but when i saw that the net result of\\nit was that _the prime minister went to france with his face bound\\nup_ i began to comprehend! and when i visited all the cottage\\nhospitals between windsor and london, and found that no one\\nanswering to my description had had his face bound up and dressed\\nthat morning, i was sure! after that, it was child’s-play for a\\nmind like mine!”\\n\\n  •   •   •   •   •   •   •\\n\\nthe following morning, poirot showed me a telegram he had just\\nreceived. it had no place of origin, and was unsigned. it ran:\\n\\n“in time.”\\n\\nlater in the day the evening papers published an account of the\\nallied conference. they laid particular stress on the magnificent\\novation accorded to mr. david macadam, whose inspiring speech had\\nproduced a deep and lasting impression.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  ix\\n\\n\\n  the disappearance of mr. davenheim\\n\\n\\npoirot and i were expecting our old friend inspector japp of\\nscotland yard to tea. we were sitting round the tea-table awaiting\\nhis arrival. poirot had just finished carefully straightening the\\ncups and saucers which our landlady was in the habit of throwing,\\nrather than placing, on the table. he had also breathed heavily on\\nthe metal teapot, and polished it with a silk handkerchief. the\\nkettle was on the boil, and a small enamel saucepan beside it\\ncontained some thick, sweet chocolate which was more to poirot’s\\npalate than what he described as “your english poison.” a sharp\\n“rat-tat” sounded below, and a few minutes afterwards japp entered\\nbriskly.\\n\\n“hope i’m not late,” he said as he greeted us. “to tell the truth,\\ni was yarning with miller, the man who’s in charge of the davenheim\\ncase.”\\n\\ni pricked up my ears. for the last three days the papers had been\\nfull of the strange disappearance of mr. davenheim, senior partner\\nof davenheim and salmon, the well-known bankers and financiers. on\\nsaturday last he had walked out of his house, and had never been\\nseen since. i looked forward to extracting some interesting details\\nfrom japp.\\n\\n“i should have thought,” i remarked, “that it would be almost\\nimpossible for anyone to ‘disappear’ nowadays.”\\n\\npoirot moved a plate of bread and butter the eighth of an inch,\\nand said sharply:\\n\\n“be exact, my friend. what do you mean by ‘disappear’? to which\\nclass of disappearance are you referring?”\\n\\n“are disappearances classified and labelled, then?” i laughed.\\n\\njapp smiled also. poirot frowned at us both.\\n\\n“but certainly they are! they fall into three categories: first,\\nand most common, the voluntary disappearance. second, the much\\nabused ‘loss of memory’ case—rare, but occasionally genuine. third,\\nmurder, and a more or less successful disposal of the body. do you\\nrefer to all three as impossible of execution?”\\n\\n“very nearly so, i should think. you might lose your own memory,\\nbut some one would be sure to recognize you—especially in the case\\nof a well-known man like davenheim. then ‘bodies’ can’t be made to\\nvanish into thin air. sooner or later they turn up, concealed in\\nlonely places, or in trunks. murder will out. in the same way, the\\nabsconding clerk, or the domestic defaulter, is bound to be run\\ndown in these days of wireless telegraphy. he can be headed off\\nfrom foreign countries; ports and railway stations are watched;\\nand, as for concealment in this country, his features and appearance\\nwill be known to every one who reads a daily newspaper. he’s up\\nagainst civilization.”\\n\\n“_mon ami_,” said poirot, “you make one error. you do not allow\\nfor the fact that a man who had decided to make away with another\\nman—or with himself in a figurative sense—might be that rare\\nmachine, a man of method. he might bring intelligence, talent, a\\ncareful calculation of detail to the task; and then i do not see\\nwhy he should not be successful in baffling the police force.”\\n\\n“but not _you_, i suppose?” said japp good-humouredly, winking at\\nme. “he couldn’t baffle _you_, eh, monsieur poirot?”\\n\\npoirot endeavoured, with a marked lack of success, to look modest.\\n“me, also! why not? it is true that i approach such problems with\\nan exact science, a mathematical precision, which seems, alas, only\\ntoo rare in the new generation of detectives!”\\n\\njapp grinned more widely.\\n\\n“i don’t know,” he said. “miller, the man who’s on this case, is\\na smart chap. you may be very sure he won’t overlook a footprint,\\nor a cigar-ash, or a crumb even. he’s got eyes that see everything.”\\n\\n“so, _mon ami_,” said poirot, “has the london sparrow. but all the\\nsame, i should not ask the little brown bird to solve the problem\\nof mr. davenheim.”\\n\\n“come now, monsieur, you’re not going to run down the value of\\ndetails as clues?”\\n\\n“by no means. these things are all good in their way. the danger\\nis they may assume undue importance. most details are insignificant;\\none or two are vital. it is the brain, the little grey cells”—he\\ntapped his forehead—“on which one must rely. the senses mislead.\\none must seek the truth within—not without.”\\n\\n“you don’t mean to say, monsieur poirot, that you would undertake\\nto solve a case without moving from your chair, do you?”\\n\\n“that is exactly what i do mean—granted the facts were placed\\nbefore me. i regard myself as a consulting specialist.”\\n\\njapp slapped his knee. “hanged if i don’t take you at your word.\\nbet you a fiver that you can’t lay your hand—or rather tell me\\nwhere to lay my hand—on mr. davenheim, dead or alive, before a week\\nis out.”\\n\\npoirot considered. “_eh bien, mon ami_, i accept. _le sport_, it\\nis the passion of you english. now—the facts.”\\n\\n“on saturday last, as is his usual custom, mr. davenheim took the\\n12.40 train from victoria to chingside, where his palatial country\\nplace, the cedars, is situated. after lunch, he strolled round the\\ngrounds, and gave various directions to the gardeners. everybody\\nagrees that his manner was absolutely normal and as usual. after\\ntea he put his head into his wife’s boudoir, saying that he was\\ngoing to stroll down to the village and post some letters. he added\\nthat he was expecting a mr. lowen, on business. if he should come\\nbefore he himself returned, he was to be shown into the study and\\nasked to wait. mr. davenheim then left the house by the front door,\\npassed leisurely down the drive, and out at the gate, and—was never\\nseen again. from that hour, he vanished completely.”\\n\\n“pretty—very pretty—altogether a charming little problem,” murmured\\npoirot. “proceed, my good friend.”\\n\\n“about a quarter of an hour later a tall, dark man with a thick\\nblack moustache rang the front-door bell, and explained that he\\nhad an appointment with mr. davenheim. he gave the name of lowen,\\nand in accordance with the banker’s instructions was shown into\\nthe study. nearly an hour passed. mr. davenheim did not return.\\nfinally mr. lowen rang the bell, and explained that he was unable\\nto wait any longer, as he must catch his train back to town. mrs.\\ndavenheim apologized for her husband’s absence, which seemed\\nunaccountable, as she knew him to have been expecting the visitor.\\nmr. lowen reiterated his regrets and took his departure.\\n\\n“well, as every one knows, mr. davenheim did not return. early on\\nsunday morning the police were communicated with, but could make\\nneither head nor tail of the matter. mr. davenheim seemed literally\\nto have vanished into thin air. he had not been to the post office;\\nnor had he been seen passing through the village. at the station\\nthey were positive he had not departed by any train. his own motor\\nhad not left the garage. if he had hired a car to meet him in some\\nlonely spot, it seems almost certain that by this time, in view of\\nthe large reward offered for information, the driver of it would\\nhave come forward to tell what he knew. true, there was a small\\nrace-meeting at entfield, five miles away, and if he had walked to\\nthat station he might have passed unnoticed in the crowd. but since\\nthen his photograph and a full description of him have been\\ncirculated in every newspaper, and nobody has been able to give\\nany news of him. we have, of course, received many letters from\\nall over england, but each clue, so far, has ended in disappointment.\\n\\n“on monday morning a further sensational discovery came to light.\\nbehind a portière in mr. davenheim’s study stands a safe, and that\\nsafe had been broken into and rifled. the windows were fastened\\nsecurely on the inside, which seems to put an ordinary burglary\\nout of court, unless, of course, an accomplice within the house\\nfastened them again afterwards. on the other hand, sunday having\\nintervened, and the household being in a state of chaos, it is\\nlikely that the burglary was committed on the saturday, and remained\\nundetected until monday.”\\n\\n“_précisément_,” said poirot dryly. “well, is he arrested, _ce\\npauvre m. lowen_?”\\n\\njapp grinned. “not yet. but he’s under pretty close supervision.”\\n\\npoirot nodded. “what was taken from the safe? have you any idea?”\\n\\n“we’ve been going into that with the junior partner of the firm\\nand mrs. davenheim. apparently there was a considerable amount in\\nbearer bonds, and a very large sum in notes, owing to some large\\ntransaction having been just carried through. there was also a\\nsmall fortune in jewellery. all mrs. davenheim’s jewels were kept\\nin the safe. the purchasing of them had become a passion with her\\nhusband of late years, and hardly a month passed that he did not\\nmake her a present of some rare and costly gem.”\\n\\n“altogether a good haul,” said poirot thoughtfully. “now, what\\nabout lowen? is it known what his business was with davenheim that\\nevening?”\\n\\n“well, the two men were apparently not on very good terms. lowen\\nis a speculator in quite a small way. nevertheless, he has been\\nable once or twice to score a _coup_ off davenheim in the market,\\nthough it seems they seldom or never actually met. it was a matter\\nconcerning some south american shares which led the banker to make\\nhis appointment.”\\n\\n“had davenheim interests in south america, then?”\\n\\n“i believe so. mrs. davenheim happened to mention that he spent\\nall last autumn in buenos ayres.”\\n\\n“any trouble in his home life? were the husband and wife on good\\nterms?”\\n\\n“i should say his domestic life was quite peaceful and uneventful.\\nmrs. davenheim is a pleasant, rather unintelligent woman. quite a\\nnonentity, i think.”\\n\\n“then we must not look for the solution of the mystery there. had\\nhe any enemies?”\\n\\n“he had plenty of financial rivals, and no doubt there are many\\npeople whom he has got the better of who bear him no particular\\ngood-will. but there was no one likely to make away with him—and,\\nif they had, where is the body?”\\n\\n“exactly. as hastings says, bodies have a habit of coming to light\\nwith fatal persistency.”\\n\\n“by the way, one of the gardeners says he saw a figure going round\\nto the side of the house toward the rose-garden. the long french\\nwindow of the study opens on to the rose-garden, and mr. davenheim\\nfrequently entered and left the house that way. but the man was a\\ngood way off, at work on some cucumber frames, and cannot even say\\nwhether it was the figure of his master or not. also, he cannot\\nfix the time with any accuracy. it must have been before six, as\\nthe gardeners cease work at that time.”\\n\\n“and mr. davenheim left the house?”\\n\\n“about half-past five or thereabouts.”\\n\\n“what lies beyond the rose-garden?”\\n\\n“a lake.”\\n\\n“with a boathouse?”\\n\\n“yes, a couple of punts are kept there. i suppose you’re thinking\\nof suicide, monsieur poirot? well, i don’t mind telling you that\\nmiller’s going down to-morrow expressly to see that piece of water\\ndragged. that’s the kind of man he is!”\\n\\npoirot smiled faintly, and turned to me. “hastings, i pray you,\\nhand me that copy of the _daily megaphone_. if i remember rightly,\\nthere is an unusually clear photograph there of the missing man.”\\n\\ni rose, and found the sheet required. poirot studied the features\\nattentively.\\n\\n“h’m!” he murmured. “wears his hair rather long and wavy, full\\nmoustache and pointed beard, bushy eyebrows. eyes dark?”\\n\\n“yes.”\\n\\n“hair and beard turning grey?”\\n\\nthe detective nodded. “well, monsieur poirot, what have you got to\\nsay to it all? clear as daylight, eh?”\\n\\n“on the contrary, most obscure.”\\n\\nthe scotland yard man looked pleased.\\n\\n“which gives me great hopes of solving it,” finished poirot\\nplacidly.\\n\\n“eh?”\\n\\n“i find it a good sign when a case is obscure. if a thing is clear\\nas daylight—_eh bien_, mistrust it! some one has made it so.”\\n\\njapp shook his head almost pityingly. “well, each to their fancy.\\nbut it’s not a bad thing to see your way clear ahead.”\\n\\n“i do not see,” murmured poirot. “i shut my eyes—and think.”\\n\\njapp sighed. “well, you’ve got a clear week to think in.”\\n\\n“and you will bring me any fresh developments that arise—the result\\nof the labours of the hard-working and lynx-eyed inspector miller,\\nfor instance?”\\n\\n“certainly. that’s in the bargain.”\\n\\n“seems a shame, doesn’t it?” said japp to me as i accompanied him\\nto the door. “like robbing a child!”\\n\\ni could not help agreeing with a smile. i was still smiling as i\\nre-entered the room.\\n\\n“_eh bien!_” said poirot immediately. “you make fun of papa poirot,\\nis it not so?” he shook his finger at me. “you do not trust his\\ngrey cells? ah, do not be confused! let us discuss this little\\nproblem—incomplete as yet, i admit, but already showing one or two\\npoints of interest.”\\n\\n“the lake!” i said significantly.\\n\\n“and even more than the lake, the boathouse!”\\n\\ni looked sidewise at poirot. he was smiling in his most inscrutable\\nfashion. i felt that, for the moment, it would be quite useless to\\nquestion him further.\\n\\nwe heard nothing of japp until the following evening, when he\\nwalked in about nine o’clock. i saw at once by his expression that\\nhe was bursting with news of some kind.\\n\\n“_eh bien_, my friend,” remarked poirot. “all goes well? but do\\nnot tell me that you have discovered the body of mr. davenheim in\\nyour lake, because i shall not believe you.”\\n\\n“we haven’t found the body, but we did find his _clothes_—the\\nidentical clothes he was wearing that day. what do you say to\\nthat?”\\n\\n“any other clothes missing from the house?”\\n\\n“no, his valet is quite positive on that point. the rest of his\\nwardrobe is intact. there’s more. we’ve arrested lowen. one of the\\nmaids, whose business it is to fasten the bedroom windows, declares\\nthat she saw lowen coming _towards_ the study through the\\nrose-garden about a quarter past six. that would be about ten\\nminutes before he left the house.”\\n\\n“what does he himself say to that?”\\n\\n“denied first of all that he had ever left the study. but the maid\\nwas positive, and he pretended afterwards that he had forgotten\\njust stepping out of the window to examine an unusual species of\\nrose. rather a weak story! and there’s fresh evidence against him\\ncome to light. mr. davenheim always wore a thick gold ring set with\\na solitaire diamond on the little finger of his right hand. well,\\nthat ring was pawned in london on saturday night by a man called\\nbilly kellett! he’s already known to the police—did three months\\nlast autumn for lifting an old gentleman’s watch. it seems he tried\\nto pawn the ring at no less than five different places, succeeded\\nat the last one, got gloriously drunk on the proceeds, assaulted\\na policeman, and was run in in consequence. i went to bow street\\nwith miller and saw him. he’s sober enough now, and i don’t mind\\nadmitting we pretty well frightened the life out of him, hinting\\nhe might be charged with murder. this is his yarn, and a very queer\\none it is.\\n\\n“he was at entfield races on saturday, though i dare say scarfpins\\nwas his line of business, rather than betting. anyway, he had a\\nbad day, and was down on his luck. he was tramping along the road\\nto chingside, and sat down in a ditch to rest just before he got\\ninto the village. a few minutes later he noticed a man coming along\\nthe road to the village, ‘dark-complexioned gent, with a big\\nmoustache, one of them city toffs,’ is his description of the man.\\n\\n“kellett was half concealed from the road by a heap of stones. just\\nbefore he got abreast of him, the man looked quickly up and down\\nthe road, and seeing it apparently deserted he took a small object\\nfrom his pocket and threw it over the hedge. then he went on\\ntowards the station. now, the object he had thrown over the hedge\\nhad fallen with a slight ‘chink’ which aroused the curiosity of\\nthe human derelict in the ditch. he investigated and, after a short\\nsearch, discovered the ring! that is kellett’s story. it’s only\\nfair to say that lowen denies it utterly, and of course the word\\nof a man like kellett can’t be relied upon in the slightest. it’s\\nwithin the bounds of possibility that he met davenheim in the lane\\nand robbed and murdered him.”\\n\\npoirot shook his head.\\n\\n“very improbable, _mon ami_. he had no means of disposing of the\\nbody. it would have been found by now. secondly, the open way in\\nwhich he pawned the ring makes it unlikely that he did murder to\\nget it. thirdly, your sneak-thief is rarely a murderer. fourthly,\\nas he has been in prison since saturday, it would be too much of\\na coincidence that he is able to give so accurate a description of\\nlowen.”\\n\\njapp nodded. “i don’t say you’re not right. but all the same, you\\nwon’t get a jury to take much note of a jailbird’s evidence. what\\nseems odd to me is that lowen couldn’t find a cleverer way of\\ndisposing of the ring.”\\n\\npoirot shrugged his shoulders. “well, after all, if it were found\\nin the neighbourhood, it might be argued that davenheim himself\\nhad dropped it.”\\n\\n“but why remove it from the body at all?” i cried.\\n\\n“there might be a reason for that,” said japp. “do you know that\\njust beyond the lake, a little gate leads out on to the hill, and\\nnot three minutes’ walk brings you to—what do you think?—a _lime\\nkiln_.”\\n\\n“good heavens!” i cried. “you mean that the lime which destroyed\\nthe body would be powerless to affect the metal of the ring?”\\n\\n“exactly.”\\n\\n“it seems to me,” i said, “that that explains everything. what a\\nhorrible crime!”\\n\\nby common consent we both turned and looked at poirot. he seemed\\nlost in reflection, his brow knitted, as though with some supreme\\nmental effort. i felt that at last his keen intellect was asserting\\nitself. what would his first words be? we were not long left in\\ndoubt. with a sigh, the tension of his attitude relaxed, and\\nturning to japp, he asked:\\n\\n“have you any idea, my friend, whether mr. and mrs. davenheim\\noccupied the same bedroom?”\\n\\nthe question seemed so ludicrously inappropriate that for a moment\\nwe both stared in silence. then japp burst into a laugh. “good\\nlord, monsieur poirot, i thought you were coming out with something\\nstartling. as to your question, i’m sure i don’t know.”\\n\\n“you could find out?” asked poirot with curious persistence.\\n\\n“oh, certainly—if you _really_ want to know.”\\n\\n“_merci, mon ami_. i should be obliged if you would make a point\\nof it.”\\n\\njapp stared at him a few minutes longer, but poirot seemed to have\\nforgotten us both. the detective shook his head sadly at me, and\\nmurmuring, “poor old fellow! war’s been too much for him!” gently\\nwithdrew from the room.\\n\\nas poirot still seemed sunk in a daydream, i took a sheet of paper,\\nand amused myself by scribbling notes upon it. my friend’s voice\\naroused me. he had come out of his reverie, and was looking brisk\\nand alert.\\n\\n“_que faites vous là, mon ami?_”\\n\\n“i was jotting down what occurred to me as the main points of\\ninterest in this affair.”\\n\\n“you become methodical—at last!” said poirot approvingly.\\n\\ni concealed my pleasure. “shall i read them to you?”\\n\\n“by all means.”\\n\\ni cleared my throat.\\n\\n“‘one: all the evidence points to lowen having been the man who\\nforced the safe.\\n\\n“‘two: he had a grudge against davenheim.\\n\\n“‘three: he lied in his first statement that he had never left the\\nstudy.\\n\\n“‘four: if you accept billy kellett’s story as true, lowen is\\nunmistakably implicated.’”\\n\\ni paused. “well?” i asked, for i felt that i had put my finger on\\nall the vital facts.\\n\\npoirot looked at me pityingly, shaking his head very gently. “_mon\\npauvre ami!_ but it is that you have not the gift! the important\\ndetail, you appreciate him never! also, your reasoning is false.”\\n\\n“how?”\\n\\n“let me take your four points.\\n\\n“one: mr. lowen could not possibly know that he would have the\\nchance to open the safe. he came for a business interview. he could\\nnot know beforehand that mr. davenheim would be absent posting a\\nletter, and that he would consequently be alone in the study!”\\n\\n“he might have seized his opportunity,” i suggested.\\n\\n“and the tools? city gentlemen do not carry round housebreaker’s\\ntools on the off chance! and one could not cut into that safe with\\na penknife, _bien entendu_!”\\n\\n“well, what about number two?”\\n\\n“you say lowen had a grudge against mr. davenheim. what you mean\\nis that he had once or twice got the better of him. and presumably\\nthose transactions were entered into with the view of benefiting\\nhimself. in any case you do not as a rule bear a grudge against a\\nman you have got the better of—it is more likely to be the other\\nway about. whatever grudge there might have been would have been\\non mr. davenheim’s side.”\\n\\n“well, you can’t deny that he lied about never having left the\\nstudy?”\\n\\n“no. but he may have been frightened. remember, the missing man’s\\nclothes had just been discovered in the lake. of course, as usual,\\nhe would have done better to speak the truth.”\\n\\n“and the fourth point?”\\n\\n“i grant you that. if kellett’s story is true, lowen is undeniably\\nimplicated. that is what makes the affair so very interesting.”\\n\\n“then i did appreciate _one_ vital fact?”\\n\\n“perhaps—but you have entirely overlooked the two most important\\npoints, the ones which undoubtedly hold the clue to the whole\\nmatter.”\\n\\n“and pray, what are they?”\\n\\n“one, the passion which has grown upon mr. davenheim in the last\\nfew years for buying jewellery. two, his trip to buenos ayres last\\nautumn.”\\n\\n“poirot, you are joking!”\\n\\n“i am most serious. ah, sacred thunder, but i hope japp will not\\nforget my little commission.”\\n\\nbut the detective, entering into the spirit of the joke, had\\nremembered it so well that a telegram was handed to poirot about\\neleven o’clock the next day. at his request i opened it and read\\nit out:\\n\\n“‘husband and wife have occupied separate rooms since last winter.’”\\n\\n“aha!” cried poirot. “and now we are in mid june! all is solved!”\\n\\ni stared at him.\\n\\n“you have no moneys in the bank of davenheim and salmon, _mon\\nami_?”\\n\\n“no,” i said, wondering. “why?”\\n\\n“because i should advise you to withdraw it—before it is too\\nlate.”\\n\\n“why, what do you expect?”\\n\\n“i expect a big smash in a few days—perhaps sooner. which reminds\\nme, we will return the compliment of a _dépêche_ to japp. a pencil,\\ni pray you, and a form. _voilà!_ ‘advise you to withdraw any money\\ndeposited with firm in question.’ that will intrigue him, the good\\njapp! his eyes will open wide—wide! he will not comprehend in the\\nslightest—until to-morrow, or the next day!”\\n\\ni remained sceptical, but the morrow forced me to render tribute\\nto my friend’s remarkable powers. in every paper was a huge headline\\ntelling of the sensational failure of the davenheim bank. the\\ndisappearance of the famous financier took on a totally different\\naspect in the light of the revelation of the financial affairs of\\nthe bank.\\n\\nbefore we were half-way through breakfast, the door flew open and\\njapp rushed in. in his left hand was a paper; in his right was\\npoirot’s telegram, which he banged down on the table in front of\\nmy friend.\\n\\n“how did you know, monsieur poirot? how the blazes could you know?”\\n\\npoirot smiled placidly at him. “ah, _mon ami_, after your wire, it\\nwas a certainty! from the commencement, see you, it struck me that\\nthe safe burglary was somewhat remarkable. jewels, ready money,\\nbearer bonds—all so conveniently arranged for—whom? well, the good\\nmonsieur davenheim was of those who ‘look after number one’ as your\\nsaying goes! it seemed almost certain that it was arranged\\nfor—himself! then his passion of late years for buying jewellery!\\nhow simple! the funds he embezzled, he converted into jewels, very\\nlikely replacing them in turn with paste duplicates, and so he put\\naway in a safe place, under another name, a considerable fortune\\nto be enjoyed all in good time when every one has been thrown off\\nthe track. his arrangements completed, he makes an appointment with\\nmr. lowen (who has been imprudent enough in the past to cross the\\ngreat man once or twice), drills a hole in the safe, leaves orders\\nthat the guest is to be shown into the study, and walks out of the\\nhouse—where?” poirot stopped, and stretched out his hand for\\nanother boiled egg. he frowned. “it is really insupportable,” he\\nmurmured, “that every hen lays an egg of a different size! what\\nsymmetry can there be on the breakfast table? at least they should\\nsort them in dozens at the shop!”\\n\\n“never mind the eggs,” said japp impatiently. “let ’em lay ’em\\nsquare if they like. tell us where our customer went to when he\\nleft the cedars—that is, if you know!”\\n\\n“_eh bien_, he went to his hiding-place. ah, this monsieur\\ndavenheim, there may be some malformation in his grey cells, but\\nthey are of the first quality!”\\n\\n“do you know where he is hiding?”\\n\\n“certainly! it is most ingenious.”\\n\\n“for the lord’s sake, tell us, then!”\\n\\npoirot gently collected every fragment of shell from his plate,\\nplaced them in the egg-cup, and reversed the empty egg-shell on\\ntop of them. this little operation concluded, he smiled on the neat\\neffect, and then beamed affectionately on us both.\\n\\n“come, my friends, you are men of intelligence. ask yourselves the\\nquestion which i asked myself. ‘if i were this man, where should\\n_i_ hide?’ hastings, what do you say?”\\n\\n“well,” i said, “i’m rather inclined to think i’d not do a bolt at\\nall. i’d stay in london—in the heart of things, travel by tubes\\nand buses; ten to one i’d never be recognized. there’s safety in\\na crowd.”\\n\\npoirot turned inquiringly to japp.\\n\\n“i don’t agree. get clear away at once—that’s the only chance. i\\nwould have had plenty of time to prepare things beforehand. i’d\\nhave a yacht waiting, with steam up, and i’d be off to one of the\\nmost out-of-the-way corners of the world before the hue and cry\\nbegan!”\\n\\nwe both looked at poirot. “what do _you_ say, monsieur?”\\n\\nfor a moment he remained silent. then a very curious smile flitted\\nacross his face.\\n\\n“my friends, if _i_ were hiding from the police, do you know\\n_where_ i should hide? _in a prison!_”\\n\\n“_what?_”\\n\\n“you are seeking monsieur davenheim in order to put him in prison,\\nso you never dream of looking to see if he may not be already\\nthere!”\\n\\n“what do you mean?”\\n\\n“you tell me madame davenheim is not a very intelligent woman.\\nnevertheless i think that if you took her to bow street and\\nconfronted her with the man billy kellett, she would recognize him!\\nin spite of the fact that he has shaved his beard and moustache\\nand those bushy eyebrows, and has cropped his hair close. a woman\\nnearly always knows her husband, though the rest of the world may\\nbe deceived!”\\n\\n“billy kellett? but he’s known to the police!”\\n\\n“did i not tell you davenheim was a clever man? he prepared his\\nalibi long beforehand. he was not in buenos ayres last autumn—he\\nwas creating the character of billy kellett, ‘doing three months,’\\nso that the police should have no suspicions when the time came.\\nhe was playing, remember, for a large fortune, as well as liberty.\\nit was worth while doing the thing thoroughly. only——”\\n\\n“yes?”\\n\\n“_eh bien_, afterwards he had to wear a false beard and wig, had\\nto _make up as himself_ again, and to sleep with a false beard is\\nnot easy—it invites detection! he cannot risk continuing to share\\nthe chamber of madame his wife. you found out for me that for the\\nlast six months, or ever since his supposed return from buenos\\nayres, he and mrs. davenheim occupied separate rooms. then i was\\nsure! everything fitted in. the gardener who fancied he saw his\\nmaster going round to the side of the house was quite right. he\\nwent to the boathouse, donned his ‘tramp’ clothes, which you may\\nbe sure had been safely hidden from the eyes of his valet, dropped\\nthe others in the lake, and proceeded to carry out his plan by\\npawning the ring in an obvious manner, and then assaulting a\\npoliceman, getting himself safely into the haven of bow street,\\nwhere nobody would ever dream of looking for him!”\\n\\n“it’s impossible,” murmured japp.\\n\\n“ask madame,” said my friend, smiling.\\n\\nthe next day a registered letter lay beside poirot’s plate. he\\nopened it, and a five-pound note fluttered out. my friend’s brow\\npuckered.\\n\\n“_ah, sacré!_ but what shall i do with it? i have much remorse!\\n_ce pauvre japp_! ah, an idea! we will have a little dinner, we\\nthree! that consoles me. it was really too easy. i am ashamed. i,\\nwho would not rob a child—_mille tonnerres! mon ami_, what have\\nyou, that you laugh so heartily?”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  x\\n\\n\\n  the adventure of the italian nobleman\\n\\n\\npoirot and i had many friends and acquaintances of an informal\\nnature. amongst these was to be numbered dr. hawker, a near\\nneighbour of ours, and a member of the medical profession. it was\\nthe genial doctor’s habit to drop in sometimes of an evening and\\nhave a chat with poirot, of whose genius he was an ardent admirer.\\nthe doctor himself, frank and unsuspicious to the last degree,\\nadmired the talents so far removed from his own.\\n\\non one particular evening in early june, he arrived about half-past\\neight and settled down to a comfortable discussion on the cheery\\ntopic of the prevalence of arsenical poisoning in crimes. it must\\nhave been about a quarter of an hour later when the door of our\\nsitting-room flew open, and a distracted female precipitated\\nherself into the room.\\n\\n“oh, doctor, you’re wanted! such a terrible voice. it gave me a\\nturn, it did indeed.”\\n\\ni recognized in our new visitor dr. hawker’s housekeeper, miss\\nrider. the doctor was a bachelor, and lived in a gloomy old house\\na few streets away. the usually placid miss rider was now in a\\nstate bordering on incoherence.\\n\\n“what terrible voice? who is it, and what’s the trouble?”\\n\\n“it was the telephone, doctor. i answered it—and a voice spoke.\\n‘help,’ it said. ‘doctor—help. they’ve killed me!’ then it sort of\\ntailed away. ‘who’s speaking?’ i said. ‘who’s speaking?’ then i\\ngot a reply, just a whisper, it seemed, ‘foscatine’—something like\\nthat—‘regent’s court.’”\\n\\nthe doctor uttered an exclamation.\\n\\n“count foscatini. he has a flat in regent’s court. i must go at\\nonce. what can have happened?”\\n\\n“a patient of yours?” asked poirot.\\n\\n“i attended him for some slight ailment a few weeks ago. an italian,\\nbut he speaks english perfectly. well, i must wish you good night,\\nmonsieur poirot, unless——” he hesitated.\\n\\n“i perceive the thought in your mind,” said poirot, smiling. “i\\nshall be delighted to accompany you. hastings, run down and get\\nhold of a taxi.”\\n\\ntaxis always make themselves sought for when one is particularly\\npressed for time, but i captured one at last, and we were soon\\nbowling along in the direction of regent’s park. regent’s court\\nwas a new block of flats, situated just off st. john’s wood road.\\nthey had only recently been built, and contained the latest service\\ndevices.\\n\\nthere was no one in the hall. the doctor pressed the lift-bell\\nimpatiently, and when the lift arrived questioned the uniformed\\nattendant sharply.\\n\\n“flat ii. count foscatini. there’s been an accident there, i\\nunderstand.”\\n\\nthe man stared at him.\\n\\n“first i’ve heard of it. mr. graves—that’s count foscatini’s\\nman—went out about half an hour ago, and he said nothing.”\\n\\n“is the count alone in the flat?”\\n\\n“no, sir, he’s got two gentlemen dining with him.”\\n\\n“what are they like?” i asked eagerly.\\n\\nwe were in the lift now, ascending rapidly to the second floor, on\\nwhich flat ii was situated.\\n\\n“i didn’t see them myself, sir, but i understand that they were\\nforeign gentlemen.”\\n\\nhe pulled back the iron door, and we stepped out on the landing.\\nno. ii was opposite to us. the doctor rang the bell. there was no\\nreply, and we could hear no sound from within. the doctor rang\\nagain and again; we could hear the bell trilling within, but no\\nsign of life rewarded us.\\n\\n“this is getting serious,” muttered the doctor. he turned to the\\nlift attendant.\\n\\n“is there any pass-key to this door?”\\n\\n“there is one in the porter’s office downstairs.”\\n\\n“get it, then, and, look here, i think you’d better send for the\\npolice.”\\n\\npoirot approved with a nod of the head.\\n\\nthe man returned shortly; with him came the manager.\\n\\n“will you tell me, gentlemen, what is the meaning of all this?”\\n\\n“certainly. i received a telephone message from count foscatini\\nstating that he had been attacked and was dying. you can understand\\nthat we must lose no time—if we are not already too late.”\\n\\nthe manager produced the key without more ado, and we all entered\\nthe flat.\\n\\nwe passed first into a small square lounge hall. a door on the\\nright of it was half open. the manager indicated it with a nod.\\n\\n“the dining-room.”\\n\\ndr. hawker led the way. we followed close on his heels. as we\\nentered the room i gave a gasp. the round table in the centre bore\\nthe remains of a meal; three chairs were pushed back, as though\\ntheir occupants had just risen. in the corner, to the right of the\\nfire-place, was a big writing-table, and sitting at it was a man—or\\nwhat had been a man. his right hand still grasped the base of the\\ntelephone, but he had fallen forward, struck down by a terrific\\nblow on the head from behind. the weapon was not far to seek. a\\nmarble statuette stood where it had been hurriedly put down, the\\nbase of it stained with blood.\\n\\nthe doctor’s examination did not take a minute. “stone dead. must\\nhave been almost instantaneous. i wonder he even managed to\\ntelephone. it will be better not to move him until the police\\narrive.”\\n\\non the manager’s suggestion we searched the flat, but the result\\nwas a foregone conclusion. it was not likely that the murderers\\nwould be concealed there when all they had to do was to walk out.\\n\\nwe came back to the dining-room. poirot had not accompanied us in\\nour tour. i found him studying the centre table with close\\nattention. i joined him. it was a well-polished round mahogany\\ntable. a bowl of roses decorated the centre, and white lace mats\\nreposed on the gleaming surface. there was a dish of fruit, but\\nthe three dessert plates were untouched. there were three\\ncoffee-cups with remains of coffee in them—two black, one with\\nmilk. all three men had taken port, and the decanter, half-full,\\nstood before the centre plate. one of the men had smoked a cigar,\\nthe other two cigarettes. a tortoiseshell-and-silver box, holding\\ncigars and cigarettes, stood open upon the table.\\n\\ni enumerated all these facts to myself, but i was forced to admit\\nthat they did not shed any brilliant light on the situation. i\\nwondered what poirot saw in them to make him so intent. i asked\\nhim.\\n\\n“_mon ami_,” he replied, “you miss the point. i am looking for\\nsomething that i do _not_ see.”\\n\\n“what is that?”\\n\\n“a mistake—even a little mistake—on the part of the murderer.”\\n\\nhe stepped swiftly to the small adjoining kitchen, looked in, and\\nshook his head.\\n\\n“monsieur,” he said to the manager, “explain to me, i pray, your\\nsystem of serving meals here.”\\n\\nthe manager stepped to a small hatch in the wall.\\n\\n“this is the service lift,” he explained. “it runs to the kitchens\\nat the top of the building. you order through this telephone, and\\nthe dishes are sent down in the lift, one course at a time. the\\ndirty plates and dishes are sent up in the same manner. no domestic\\nworries, you understand, and at the same time you avoid the wearying\\npublicity of always dining in a restaurant.”\\n\\npoirot nodded.\\n\\n“then the plates and dishes that were used to-night are on high in\\nthe kitchen. you permit that i mount there?”\\n\\n“oh, certainly, if you like! roberts, the lift man, will take you\\nup and introduce you; but i’m afraid you won’t find anything that’s\\nof any use. they’re handling hundreds of plates and dishes, and\\nthey’ll be all lumped together.”\\n\\npoirot remained firm, however, and together we visited the kitchens\\nand questioned the man who had taken the order from flat ii.\\n\\n“the order was given from the _à la carte menu_—for three,” he\\nexplained. “soup julienne, filet de sole normande, tournedos of\\nbeef, and a rice soufflé. what time? just about eight o’clock, i\\nshould say. no, i’m afraid the plates and dishes have been all\\nwashed up by now. unfortunate. you were thinking of finger-prints,\\ni suppose?”\\n\\n“not exactly,” said poirot, with an enigmatical smile. “i am more\\ninterested in count foscatini’s appetite. did he partake of every\\ndish?”\\n\\n“yes; but of course i can’t say how much of each he ate. the plates\\nwere all soiled, and the dishes empty—that is to say, with the\\nexception of the rice soufflé. there was a fair amount of that\\nleft.”\\n\\n“ah!” said poirot, and seemed satisfied with the fact.\\n\\nas we descended to the flat again he remarked in a low tone:\\n\\n“we have decidedly to do with a man of method.”\\n\\n“do you mean the murderer, or count foscatini?”\\n\\n“the latter was undoubtedly an orderly gentleman. after imploring\\nhelp and announcing his approaching demise, he carefully hung up\\nthe telephone receiver.”\\n\\ni stared at poirot. his words now and his recent inquiries gave me\\nthe glimmering of an idea.\\n\\n“you suspect poison?” i breathed. “the blow on the head was a\\nblind.”\\n\\npoirot merely smiled.\\n\\nwe re-entered the flat to find the local inspector of police had\\narrived with two constables. he was inclined to resent our\\nappearance, but poirot calmed him with the mention of our scotland\\nyard friend, inspector japp, and we were accorded a grudging\\npermission to remain. it was a lucky thing we were, for we had not\\nbeen back five minutes before an agitated middle-aged man came\\nrushing into the room with every appearance of grief and agitation.\\n\\nthis was graves, valet-butler to the late count foscatini. the\\nstory he had to tell was a sensational one.\\n\\non the previous morning, two gentlemen had called to see his\\nmaster. they were italians, and the elder of the two, a man of\\nabout forty, gave his name as signor ascanio. the younger was a\\nwell-dressed lad of about twenty-four.\\n\\ncount foscatini was evidently prepared for their visit and\\nimmediately sent graves out upon some trivial errand. here the man\\npaused and hesitated in his story. in the end, however, he admitted\\nthat, curious as to the purport of the interview, he had not obeyed\\nimmediately, but had lingered about endeavouring to hear something\\nof what was going on.\\n\\nthe conversation was carried on in so low a tone that he was not\\nas successful as he had hoped; but he gathered enough to make it\\nclear that some kind of monetary proposition was being discussed,\\nand that the basis of it was a threat. the discussion was anything\\nbut amicable. in the end, count foscatini raised his voice slightly,\\nand the listener heard these words clearly:\\n\\n“i have no time to argue further now, gentlemen. if you will dine\\nwith me to-morrow night at eight o’clock, we will resume the\\ndiscussion.”\\n\\nafraid of being discovered listening, graves had then hurried out\\nto do his master’s errand. this evening the two men had arrived\\npunctually at eight. during dinner they had talked of indifferent\\nmatters—politics, the weather, and the theatrical world. when\\ngraves had placed the port upon the table and brought in the coffee\\nhis master told him that he might have the evening off.\\n\\n“was that a usual proceeding of his when he had guests?” asked the\\ninspector.\\n\\n“no, sir; it wasn’t. that’s what made me think it must be some\\nbusiness of a very unusual kind that he was going to discuss with\\nthese gentlemen.”\\n\\nthat finished graves’s story. he had gone out about 8.30, and,\\nmeeting a friend, had accompanied him to the metropolitan music\\nhall in edgware road.\\n\\nnobody had seen the two men leave, but the time of the murder was\\nfixed clearly enough at 8.47. a small clock on the writing-table\\nhad been swept off by foscatini’s arm, and had stopped at that\\nhour, which agreed with miss rider’s telephone summons.\\n\\nthe police surgeon had made his examination of the body, and it\\nwas now lying on the couch. i saw the face for the first time—the\\nolive complexion, the long nose, the luxuriant black moustache,\\nand the full red lips drawn back from the dazzlingly white teeth.\\nnot altogether a pleasant face.\\n\\n“well,” said the inspector, refastening his notebook. “the case\\nseems clear enough. the only difficulty will be to lay our hands\\non this signor ascanio. i suppose his address is not in the dead\\nman’s pocket-book by any chance?”\\n\\nas poirot had said, the late foscatini was an orderly man. neatly\\nwritten in small, precise handwriting was the inscription, “signor\\npaolo ascanio, grosvenor hotel.”\\n\\nthe inspector busied himself with the telephone, then turned to us\\nwith a grin.\\n\\n“just in time. our fine gentleman was off to catch the boat train\\nto the continong. well, gentlemen, that’s about all we can do here.\\nit’s a bad business, but straightforward enough. one of these\\nitalian vendetta things, as likely as not.”\\n\\nthus airily dismissed, we found our way downstairs. dr. hawker was\\nfull of excitement.\\n\\n“like the beginning of a novel, eh? real exciting stuff. wouldn’t\\nbelieve it if you read about it.”\\n\\npoirot did not speak. he was very thoughtful. all the evening he\\nhad hardly opened his lips.\\n\\n“what says the master detective, eh?” asked hawker, clapping him\\non the back. “nothing to work your grey cells over this time.”\\n\\n“you think not?”\\n\\n“what could there be?”\\n\\n“well, for example, there is the window.”\\n\\n“the window? but it was fastened. nobody could have got out or in\\nthat way. i noticed it specially.”\\n\\n“and why were you able to notice it?”\\n\\nthe doctor looked puzzled. poirot hastened to explain.\\n\\n“it is to the curtains i refer. they were not drawn. a little odd,\\nthat. and then there was the coffee. it was very black coffee.”\\n\\n“well, what of it?”\\n\\n“very black,” repeated poirot. “in conjunction with that let us\\nremember that very little of the rice soufflé was eaten, and we\\nget—what?”\\n\\n“moonshine,” laughed the doctor. “you’re pulling my leg.”\\n\\n“never do i pull the leg. hastings here knows that i am perfectly\\nserious.”\\n\\n“i don’t know what you are getting at, all the same,” i confessed.\\n“you don’t suspect the manservant, do you? he might have been in\\nwith the gang, and put some dope in the coffee. i suppose they’ll\\ntest his alibi?”\\n\\n“without doubt, my friend; but it is the alibi of signor ascanio\\nthat interests me.”\\n\\n“you think he has an alibi?”\\n\\n“that is just what worries me. i have no doubt that we shall soon\\nbe enlightened on that point.”\\n\\nthe _daily newsmonger_ enabled us to become conversant with\\nsucceeding events.\\n\\nsignor ascanio was arrested and charged with the murder of count\\nfoscatini. when arrested, he denied knowing the count, and declared\\nhe had never been near regent’s court either on the evening of the\\ncrime or on the previous morning. the younger man had disappeared\\nentirely. signor ascanio had arrived alone at the grosvenor hotel\\nfrom the continent two days before the murder. all efforts to trace\\nthe second man failed.\\n\\nascanio, however, was not sent for trial. no less a personage than\\nthe italian ambassador himself came forward and testified at the\\npolice-court proceedings that ascanio had been with him at the\\nembassy from eight till nine that evening. the prisoner was\\ndischarged. naturally, a lot of people thought that the crime was\\na political one, and was being deliberately hushed up.\\n\\npoirot had taken a keen interest in all these points. nevertheless,\\ni was somewhat surprised when he suddenly informed me one morning\\nthat he was expecting a visitor at eleven o’clock, and that that\\nvisitor was none other than ascanio himself.\\n\\n“he wishes to consult you?”\\n\\n“_du tout_, hastings. i wish to consult him.”\\n\\n“what about?”\\n\\n“the regent’s court murder.”\\n\\n“you are going to prove that he did it?”\\n\\n“a man cannot be tried twice for murder, hastings. endeavour to\\nhave the common sense. ah, that is our friend’s ring.”\\n\\na few minutes later signor ascanio was ushered in—a small, thin\\nman with a secretive and furtive glance in his eyes. he remained\\nstanding, darting suspicious glances from one to the other of us.\\n\\n“monsieur poirot?”\\n\\nmy little friend tapped himself gently on the chest.\\n\\n“be seated, signor. you received my note. i am determined to get\\nto the bottom of this mystery. in some small measure you can aid\\nme. let us commence. you—in company with a friend—visited the late\\ncount foscatini on the morning of tuesday the 9th——”\\n\\nthe italian made an angry gesture.\\n\\n“i did nothing of the sort. i have sworn in court——”\\n\\n“_précisément_—and i have a little idea that you have sworn\\nfalsely.”\\n\\n“you threaten me? bah! i have nothing to fear from you. i have been\\nacquitted.”\\n\\n“exactly; and as i am not an imbecile, it is not with the gallows\\ni threaten you—but with publicity. publicity! i see that you do\\nnot like the word. i had an idea that you would not. my little\\nideas, you know, they are very valuable to me. come, signor, your\\nonly chance is to be frank with me. i do not ask to know whose\\nindiscretions brought you to england. i know this much, you came\\nfor the especial purpose of seeing count foscatini.”\\n\\n“he was not a count,” growled the italian.\\n\\n“i have already noted the fact that his name does not appear in\\nthe _almanach de gotha_. never mind, the title of count is often\\nuseful in the profession of blackmailing.”\\n\\n“i suppose i might as well be frank. you seem to know a good deal.”\\n\\n“i have employed my grey cells to some advantage. come, signor\\nascanio, you visited the dead man on the tuesday morning—that is\\nso, is it not?”\\n\\n“yes; but i never went there on the following evening. there was\\nno need. i will tell you all. certain information concerning a man\\nof great position in italy had come into this scoundrel’s\\npossession. he demanded a big sum of money in return for the\\npapers. i came over to england to arrange the matter. i called upon\\nhim by appointment that morning. one of the young secretaries of\\nthe embassy was with me. the count was more reasonable than i had\\nhoped, although even then the sum of money i paid him was a huge\\none.”\\n\\n“pardon, how was it paid?”\\n\\n“in italian notes of comparatively small denomination. i paid over\\nthe money then and there. he handed me the incriminating papers.\\ni never saw him again.”\\n\\n“why did you not say all this when you were arrested?”\\n\\n“in my delicate position i was forced to deny any association with\\nthe man.”\\n\\n“and how do you account for the events of the evening, then?”\\n\\n“i can only think that some one must have deliberately impersonated\\nme. i understand that no money was found in the flat.”\\n\\npoirot looked at him and shook his head.\\n\\n“strange,” he murmured. “we all have the little grey cells. and so\\nfew of us know how to use them. good morning, signor ascanio. i\\nbelieve your story. it is very much as i had imagined. but i had\\nto make sure.”\\n\\nafter bowing his guest out, poirot returned to his arm-chair and\\nsmiled at me.\\n\\n“let us hear m. le capitaine hastings on the case?”\\n\\n“well, i suppose ascanio is right—somebody impersonated him.”\\n\\n“never, never will you use the brains the good god has given you.\\nrecall to yourself some words i uttered after leaving the flat that\\nnight. i referred to the window-curtains not being drawn. we are\\nin the month of june. it is still light at eight o’clock. the light\\nis failing by half-past. _ça vous dit quelque chose?_ i perceive\\na struggling impression that you will arrive some day. now let us\\ncontinue. the coffee was, as i said, very black. count foscatini’s\\nteeth were magnificently white. coffee stains the teeth. we reason\\nfrom that that count foscatini did not drink any coffee. yet there\\nwas coffee in all three cups. why should anyone pretend count\\nfoscatini had drunk coffee when he had not done so?”\\n\\ni shook my head, utterly bewildered.\\n\\n“come, i will help you. what evidence have we that ascanio and his\\nfriend, or two men posing as them, ever came to the flat that\\nnight? nobody saw them go in; nobody saw them go out. we have the\\nevidence of one man and of a host of inanimate objects.”\\n\\n“you mean?”\\n\\n“i mean knives and forks and plates and empty dishes. ah, but it\\nwas a clever idea! graves is a thief and a scoundrel, but what a\\nman of method! he overhears a portion of the conversation in the\\nmorning, enough to realize that ascanio will be in awkward position\\nto defend himself. the following evening, about eight o’clock, he\\ntells his master he is wanted at the telephone. foscatini sits\\ndown, stretches out his hand to the telephone, and from behind\\ngraves strikes him down with the marble figure. then quickly to\\nthe service telephone—dinner for three! it comes, he lays the\\ntable, dirties the plates, knives, and forks, etc. but he has to\\nget rid of the food too. not only is he a man of brain; he has a\\nresolute and capacious stomach! but after eating three tournedos,\\nthe rice soufflé is too much for him! he even smokes a cigar and\\ntwo cigarettes to carry out the illusion. ah, but it was\\nmagnificently thorough! then, having moved on the hands of the\\nclock to 8.47, he smashes it and stops it. the one thing he does\\nnot do is to draw the curtains. but if there had been a real dinner\\nparty the curtains would have been drawn as soon as the light began\\nto fail. then he hurries out, mentioning the guests to the lift\\nman in passing. he hurries to a telephone box, and as near as\\npossible to 8.47 rings up the doctor with his master’s dying cry.\\nso successful is his idea that no one ever inquires if a call was\\nput through from flat ii at that time.”\\n\\n“except hercule poirot, i suppose?” i said sarcastically.\\n\\n“not even hercule poirot,” said my friend, with a smile. “i am\\nabout to inquire now. i had to prove my point to you first. but\\nyou will see, i shall be right; and then japp, to whom i have\\nalready given a hint, will be able to arrest the respectable\\ngraves. i wonder how much of the money he has spent.”\\n\\npoirot _was_ right. he always is, confound him!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  xi\\n\\n\\n  the case of the missing will\\n\\n\\nthe problem presented to us by miss violet marsh made rather a\\npleasant change from our usual routine work. poirot had received\\na brisk and business-like note from the lady asking for an\\nappointment, and he had replied asking her to call upon him at\\neleven o’clock the following day.\\n\\nshe arrived punctually—a tall, handsome young woman, plainly but\\nneatly dressed, with an assured and business-like manner. clearly\\na young woman who meant to get on in the world. i am not a great\\nadmirer of the so-called new woman myself, and, in spite of her\\ngood looks, i was not particularly prepossessed in her favour.\\n\\n“my business is of a somewhat unusual nature, monsieur poirot,”\\nshe began, after she had accepted a chair. “i had better begin at\\nthe beginning and tell you the whole story.”\\n\\n“if you please, mademoiselle.”\\n\\n“i am an orphan. my father was one of two brothers, sons of a small\\nyeoman farmer in devonshire. the farm was a poor one, and the elder\\nbrother, andrew, emigrated to australia, where he did very well\\nindeed, and by means of successful speculation in land became a\\nvery rich man. the younger brother, roger (my father), had no\\nleanings towards the agricultural life. he managed to educate\\nhimself a little, and obtained a post as a clerk with a small firm.\\nhe married slightly above him; my mother was the daughter of a poor\\nartist. my father died when i was six years old. when i was\\nfourteen, my mother followed him to the grave. my only living\\nrelation then was my uncle andrew, who had recently returned from\\naustralia and bought a small place, crabtree manor, in his native\\ncounty. he was exceedingly kind to his brother’s orphan child, took\\nme to live with him, and treated me in every way as though i was\\nhis own daughter.\\n\\n“crabtree manor, in spite of its name, is really only an old\\nfarmhouse. farming was in my uncle’s blood, and he was intensely\\ninterested in various modern farming experiments. although kindness\\nitself to me, he had certain peculiar and deeply-rooted ideas as\\nto the up-bringing of women. himself a man of little or no\\neducation, though possessing remarkable shrewdness, he placed\\nlittle value on what he called ‘book knowledge.’ he was especially\\nopposed to the education of women. in his opinion, girls should\\nlearn practical housework and dairy-work, be useful about the home,\\nand have as little to do with book learning as possible. he proposed\\nto bring me up on these lines, to my bitter disappointment and\\nannoyance. i rebelled frankly. i knew that i possessed a good\\nbrain, and had absolutely no talent for domestic duties. my uncle\\nand i had many bitter arguments on the subject, for, though much\\nattached to each other, we were both self-willed. i was lucky\\nenough to win a scholarship, and up to a certain point was\\nsuccessful in getting my own way. the crisis arose when i resolved\\nto go to girton. i had a little money of my own, left me by my\\nmother, and i was quite determined to make the best use of the\\ngifts god had given me. i had one long, final argument with my\\nuncle. he put the facts plainly before me. he had no other\\nrelations, and he had intended me to be his sole heiress. as i have\\ntold you, he was a very rich man. if i persisted in these\\n‘new-fangled notions’ of mine, however, i need look for nothing\\nfrom him. i remained polite, but firm. i should always be deeply\\nattached to him, i told him, but i must lead my own life. we parted\\non that note. ‘you fancy your brains, my girl,’ were his last\\nwords. ‘i’ve no book learning, but, for all that, i’ll pit mine\\nagainst yours any day. we’ll see what we shall see.’\\n\\n“that was nine years ago. i have stayed with him for a week-end\\noccasionally, and our relations were perfectly amicable, though\\nhis views remained unaltered. he never referred to my having\\nmatriculated, nor to my b.sc. for the last three years his health\\nhad been failing, and a month ago he died.\\n\\n“i am now coming to the point of my visit. my uncle left a most\\nextraordinary will. by its terms, crabtree manor and its contents\\nare to be at my disposal for a year from his death—‘during which\\ntime my clever niece may prove her wits,’ the actual words run. at\\nthe end of that period, ‘my wits having proved better than hers,’\\nthe house and all my uncle’s large fortune pass to various\\ncharitable institutions.”\\n\\n“that is a little hard on you, mademoiselle, seeing that you were\\nmr. marsh’s only blood relation.”\\n\\n“i do not look on it in that way. uncle andrew warned me fairly,\\nand i chose my own path. since i would not fall in with his wishes,\\nhe was at perfect liberty to leave his money to whom he pleased.”\\n\\n“was the will drawn up by a lawyer?”\\n\\n“no; it was written on a printed will-form and witnessed by the\\nman and his wife who live in the house and do for my uncle.”\\n\\n“there might be a possibility of upsetting such a will?”\\n\\n“i would not even attempt to do such a thing.”\\n\\n“you regard it, then, as a sporting challenge on the part of your\\nuncle?”\\n\\n“that is exactly how i look upon it.”\\n\\n“it bears that interpretation, certainly,” said poirot thoughtfully.\\n“somewhere in this rambling old manor-house your uncle has concealed\\neither a sum of money in notes or possibly a second will, and has\\ngiven you a year in which to exercise your ingenuity to find it.”\\n\\n“exactly, monsieur poirot; and i am paying you the compliment of\\nassuming that your ingenuity will be greater than mine.”\\n\\n“eh, eh! but that is very charming of you. my grey cells are at\\nyour disposal. you have made no search yourself?”\\n\\n“only a cursory one; but i have too much respect for my uncle’s\\nundoubted abilities to fancy that the task will be an easy one.”\\n\\n“have you the will or a copy of it with you?”\\n\\nmiss marsh handed a document across the table. poirot ran through\\nit, nodding to himself.\\n\\n“made three years ago. dated march 25; and the time is given\\nalso—11 a.m.—that is very suggestive. it narrows the field of\\nsearch. assuredly it is another will we have to seek for. a will\\nmade even half-an-hour later would upset this. _eh bien_,\\nmademoiselle, it is a problem charming and ingenious that you have\\npresented to me here. i shall have all the pleasure in the world\\nin solving it for you. granted that your uncle was a man of ability,\\nhis grey cells cannot have been of the quality of hercule poirot’s!”\\n\\n(really, poirot’s vanity is blatant!)\\n\\n“fortunately, i have nothing of moment on hand at the minute.\\nhastings and i will go down to crabtree manor to-night. the man\\nand wife who attended on your uncle are still there, i presume?”\\n\\n“yes, their name is baker.”\\n\\n\\n  •   •   •   •   •   •   •\\n\\n\\nthe following morning saw us started on the hunt proper. we had\\narrived late the night before. mr. and mrs. baker, having received\\na telegram from miss marsh, were expecting us. they were a pleasant\\ncouple, the man gnarled and pink-cheeked, like a shrivelled pippin,\\nand his wife a woman of vast proportions and true devonshire calm.\\n\\ntired with our journey and the eight-mile drive from the station,\\nwe had retired at once to bed after a supper of roast chicken,\\napple pie, and devonshire cream. we had now disposed of an excellent\\nbreakfast, and were sitting in a small panelled room which had been\\nthe late mr. marsh’s study and living-room. a roll-top desk stuffed\\nwith papers, all neatly docketed, stood against the wall, and a\\nbig leather armchair showed plainly that it had been its owner’s\\nconstant resting-place. a big chintz-covered settee ran along the\\nopposite wall, and the deep low window seats were covered with the\\nsame faded chintz of an old-fashioned pattern.\\n\\n“_eh bien, mon ami_,” said poirot, lighting one of his tiny\\ncigarettes, “we must map out our plan of campaign. already i have\\nmade a rough survey of the house, but i am of opinion that any clue\\nwill be found in this room. we shall have to go through the\\ndocuments in the desk with meticulous care. naturally, i do not\\nexpect to find the will amongst them; but it is likely that some\\napparently innocent paper may conceal the clue to its hiding-place.\\nbut first we must have a little information. ring the bell, i pray\\nof you.”\\n\\ni did so. while we were waiting for it to be answered, poirot\\nwalked up and down, looking about him approvingly.\\n\\n“a man of method this mr. marsh. see how neatly the packets of\\npapers are docketed; then the key to each drawer has its ivory\\nlabel—so has the key of the china cabinet on the wall; and see\\nwith what precision the china within is arranged. it rejoices the\\nheart. nothing here offends the eye——”\\n\\nhe came to an abrupt pause, as his eye was caught by the key of\\nthe desk itself, to which a dirty envelope was affixed. poirot\\nfrowned at it and withdrew it from the lock. on it were scrawled\\nthe words: “key of roll top desk,” in a crabbed handwriting, quite\\nunlike the neat superscriptions on the other keys.\\n\\n“an alien note,” said poirot, frowning. “i could swear that here\\nwe have no longer the personality of mr. marsh. but who else has\\nbeen in the house? only miss marsh, and she, if i mistake not, is\\nalso a young lady of method and order.”\\n\\nbaker came in answer to the bell.\\n\\n“will you fetch madame your wife, and answer a few questions?”\\n\\nbaker departed, and in a few moments returned with mrs. baker,\\nwiping her hands on her apron and beaming all over her face.\\n\\nin a few clear words poirot set forth the object of his mission.\\nthe bakers were immediately sympathetic.\\n\\n“us don’t want to see miss violet done out of what’s hers,” declared\\nthe woman. “cruel hard ’twould be for hospitals to get it all.”\\n\\npoirot proceeded with his questions. yes, mr. and mrs. baker\\nremembered perfectly witnessing the will. baker had previously been\\nsent into the neighbouring town to get two printed will-forms.\\n\\n“two?” said poirot sharply.\\n\\n“yes, sir, for safety like, i suppose, in case he should spoil\\none—and sure enough, so he did do. us had signed one——”\\n\\n“what time of day was that?”\\n\\nbaker scratched his head, but his wife was quicker.\\n\\n“why, to be sure, i’d just put the milk on for the cocoa at eleven.\\ndon’t ee remember? it had all boiled over on the stove when us got\\nback to kitchen.”\\n\\n“and afterwards?”\\n\\n“’twould be about an hour later. us had to go in again. ‘i’ve made\\na mistake,’ says old master, ‘had to tear the whole thing up. i’ll\\ntrouble you to sign again,’ and us did. and afterwards master give\\nus a tidy sum of money each. ‘i’ve left you nothing in my will,’\\nsays he, ‘but each year i live you’ll have this to be a nest-egg\\nwhen i’m gone’; and sure enough, so he did.”\\n\\npoirot reflected.\\n\\n“after you had signed the second time, what did mr. marsh do? do\\nyou know?”\\n\\n“went out to the village to pay tradesmen’s books.”\\n\\nthat did not seem very promising. poirot tried another tack. he\\nheld out the key of the desk.\\n\\n“is that your master’s writing?”\\n\\ni may have imagined it, but i fancied that a moment or two elapsed\\nbefore baker replied: “yes, sir, it is.”\\n\\n“he’s lying,” i thought. “but why?”\\n\\n“has your master let the house?—have there been any strangers in\\nit during the last three years?”\\n\\n“no, sir.”\\n\\n“no visitors?”\\n\\n“only miss violet.”\\n\\n“no strangers of any kind been inside this room?”\\n\\n“no, sir.”\\n\\n“you forget the workmen, jim,” his wife reminded him.\\n\\n“workmen?” poirot wheeled round on her. “what workmen?”\\n\\nthe woman explained that about two years and a half ago workmen\\nhad been in the house to do certain repairs. she was quite vague\\nas to what the repairs were. her view seemed to be that the whole\\nthing was a fad of her master’s and quite unnecessary. part of the\\ntime the workmen had been in the study; but what they had done\\nthere she could not say, as her master had not let either of them\\ninto the room whilst the work was in progress. unfortunately, they\\ncould not remember the name of the firm employed, beyond the fact\\nthat it was a plymouth one.\\n\\n“we progress, hastings,” said poirot, rubbing his hands as the\\nbakers left the room. “clearly he made a second will and then had\\nworkmen from plymouth in to make a suitable hiding-place. instead\\nof wasting time taking up the floor and tapping the walls, we will\\ngo to plymouth.”\\n\\nwith a little trouble, we were able to get the information we\\nwanted. after one or two essays, we found the firm employed by mr.\\nmarsh.\\n\\ntheir employees had all been with them many years, and it was easy\\nto find the two men who had worked under mr. marsh’s orders. they\\nremembered the job perfectly. amongst various other minor jobs,\\nthey had taken up one of the bricks of the old-fashioned fireplace,\\nmade a cavity beneath, and so cut the brick that it was impossible\\nto see the join. by pressing on the second brick from the end, the\\nwhole thing was raised. it had been quite a complicated piece of\\nwork, and the old gentleman had been very fussy about it. our\\ninformant was a man called coghan, a big, gaunt man with a grizzled\\nmoustache. he seemed an intelligent fellow.\\n\\nwe returned to crabtree manor in high spirits, and, locking the\\nstudy door, proceeded to put our newly acquired knowledge into\\neffect. it was impossible to see any sign on the bricks, but when\\nwe pressed in the manner indicated, a deep cavity was at once\\ndisclosed.\\n\\neagerly poirot plunged in his hand. suddenly his face fell from\\ncomplacent elation to consternation. all he held was a charred\\nfragment of stiff paper. but for it, the cavity was empty.\\n\\n“_sacré!_” cried poirot angrily. “some one has been before us.”\\n\\nwe examined the scrap of paper anxiously. clearly it was a fragment\\nof what we sought. a portion of baker’s signature remained, but no\\nindication of what the terms of the will had been.\\n\\npoirot sat back on his heels. his expression would have been\\ncomical if we had not been so overcome.\\n\\n“i understand it not,” he growled. “who destroyed this? and what\\nwas their object?”\\n\\n“the bakers?” i suggested.\\n\\n“_pourquoi?_ neither will makes any provision for them, and they\\nare more likely to be kept on with miss marsh than if the place\\nbecame the property of a hospital. how could it be to anyone’s\\nadvantage to destroy the will? the hospitals benefit—yes; but one\\ncannot suspect institutions.”\\n\\n“perhaps the old man changed his mind and destroyed it himself,”\\ni suggested.\\n\\npoirot rose to his feet, dusting his knees with his usual care.\\n\\n“that may be,” he admitted. “one of your more sensible observations,\\nhastings. well, we can do no more here. we have done all that\\nmortal man can do. we have successfully pitted our wits against\\nthe late andrew marsh’s; but, unfortunately, his niece is no better\\noff for our success.”\\n\\nby driving to the station at once, we were just able to catch a\\ntrain to london, though not the principal express. poirot was sad\\nand dissatisfied. for my part, i was tired and dozed in a corner.\\nsuddenly, as we were just moving out of taunton, poirot uttered a\\npiercing squeal.\\n\\n“_vite_, hastings! awake and jump! but jump i say!”\\n\\nbefore i knew where i was we were standing on the platform,\\nbareheaded and minus our valises, whilst the train disappeared into\\nthe night. i was furious. but poirot paid no attention.\\n\\n“imbecile that i have been!” he cried. “triple imbecile! not again\\nwill i vaunt my little grey cells!”\\n\\n“that’s a good job at any rate,” i said grumpily. “but what is this\\nall about?”\\n\\nas usual, when following out his own ideas, poirot paid absolutely\\nno attention to me.\\n\\n“the tradesmen’s books—i have left them entirely out of account!\\nyes, but where? where? never mind, i cannot be mistaken. we must\\nreturn at once.”\\n\\neasier said than done. we managed to get a slow train to exeter,\\nand there poirot hired a car. we arrived back at crabtree manor in\\nthe small hours of the morning. i pass over the bewilderment of\\nthe bakers when we had at last aroused them. paying no attention\\nto anybody, poirot strode at once to the study.\\n\\n“i have been, not a triple imbecile, but thirty-six times one, my\\nfriend,” he deigned to remark. “now, behold!”\\n\\ngoing straight to the desk, he drew out the key, and detached the\\nenvelope from it. i stared at him stupidly. how could he possibly\\nhope to find a big will-form in that tiny envelope? with great care\\nhe cut open the envelope, laying it out flat. then he lighted the\\nfire and held the plain inside surface of the envelope to the\\nflame. in a few minutes faint characters began to appear.\\n\\n“look, _mon ami_!” cried poirot in triumph.\\n\\ni looked. there were just a few lines of faint writing stating\\nbriefly that he left everything to his niece, violet marsh. it was\\ndated march 25, 12.30 p.m., and witnessed by albert pike,\\nconfectioner, and jessie pike, married woman.\\n\\n“but is it legal?” i gasped.\\n\\n“as far as i know, there is no law against writing your will in a\\nblend of disappearing and sympathetic ink. the intention of the\\ntestator is clear, and the beneficiary is his only living relation.\\nbut the cleverness of him! he foresaw every step that a searcher\\nwould take—that i, miserable imbecile, took. he gets two will-forms,\\nmakes the servants sign twice, then sallies out with his will\\nwritten on the inside of a dirty envelope and a fountain-pen\\ncontaining his little ink mixture. on some excuse he gets the\\nconfectioner and his wife to sign their names under his own\\nsignature, then he ties it to the key of his desk and chuckles to\\nhimself. if his niece sees through his little ruse, she will have\\njustified her choice of life and elaborate education, and be\\nthoroughly welcome to his money.”\\n\\n“she didn’t see through it, did she?” i said slowly. “it seems\\nrather unfair. the old man really won.”\\n\\n“but no, hastings. it is _your_ wits that go astray. miss marsh\\nproved the astuteness of her wits and the value of the higher\\neducation for women by at once putting the matter in _my_ hands.\\nalways employ the expert. she has amply proved her right to the\\nmoney.”\\n\\ni wonder—i very much wonder—what old andrew marsh would have\\nthought!\\n\\n\\n  the end\\n\\nthe murder on the links\\n\\n\\nby agatha christie\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nto my husband\\n\\na fellow enthusiast for

exists to the effect that a young\\nwriter, determined to make the commencement of his story forcible and\\noriginal enough to catch and rivet the attention of the most blasé of\\neditors, penned the following sentence:\\n\\n“\\u200a‘hell!’ said the duchess.”\\n\\nstrangely enough, this tale of mine opens in much the same fashion.\\nonly the lady who gave utterance to the exclamation was not a duchess!\\n\\nit was a day in early june. i had been transacting some business in\\nparis and was returning by the morning service to london where i was\\nstill sharing rooms with my old friend, the belgian ex-detective,\\nhercule poirot.\\n\\nthe calais express was singularly empty—in fact, my own compartment\\nheld only one other traveller. i had made a somewhat hurried departure\\nfrom the hotel and was busy assuring myself that i had duly collected\\nall my traps when the train started. up till then i had hardly noticed\\nmy companion, but i was now violently recalled to the fact of her\\nexistence. jumping up from her seat, she let down the window and stuck\\nher head out, withdrawing it a moment later with the brief and forcible\\nejaculation “hell!”\\n\\nnow i am old-fashioned. a woman, i consider, should be womanly. i have\\nno patience with the modern neurotic girl who jazzes from morning to\\nnight, smokes like a chimney, and uses language which would make a\\nbillingsgate fishwoman blush!\\n\\ni looked up now, frowning slightly, into a pretty, impudent face,\\nsurmounted by a rakish little red hat. a thick cluster of black curls\\nhid each ear. i judged that she was little more than seventeen, but her\\nface was covered with powder, and her lips were quite impossibly\\nscarlet.\\n\\nnothing abashed, she returned my glance, and executed an expressive\\ngrimace.\\n\\n“dear me, we’ve shocked the kind gentleman!” she observed to an\\nimaginary audience. “i apologize for my language! most unladylike, and\\nall that, but oh, lord, there’s reason enough for it! do you know i’ve\\nlost my only sister?”\\n\\n“really?” i said politely. “how unfortunate.”\\n\\n“he disapproves!” remarked the lady. “he disapproves utterly—of me, and\\nmy sister—which last is unfair, because he hasn’t seen her!”\\n\\ni opened my mouth, but she forestalled me.\\n\\n“say no more! nobody loves me! i shall go into the garden and eat\\nworms! boohoo! i am crushed!”\\n\\nshe buried herself behind a large comic french paper. in a minute or\\ntwo i saw her eyes stealthily peeping at me over the top. in spite of\\nmyself i could not help smiling, and in a minute she had tossed the\\npaper aside, and had burst into a merry peal of laughter.\\n\\n“i knew you weren’t such a mutt as you looked,” she cried.\\n\\nher laughter was so infectious that i could not help joining in, though\\ni hardly cared for the word “mutt.” the girl was certainly all that i\\nmost disliked, but that was no reason why i should make myself\\nridiculous by my attitude. i prepared to unbend. after all, she was\\ndecidedly pretty.\\u200a…\\n\\n“there! now we’re friends!” declared the minx. “say you’re sorry about\\nmy sister—”\\n\\n“i am desolated!”\\n\\n“that’s a good boy!”\\n\\n“let me finish. i was going to add that, although i am desolated, i can\\nmanage to put up with her absence very well.” i made a little bow.\\n\\nbut this most unaccountable of damsels frowned and shook her head.\\n\\n“cut it out. i prefer the ‘dignified disapproval’ stunt. oh, your face!\\n‘not one of us,’ it said. and you were right there—though, mind you,\\nit’s pretty hard to tell nowadays. it’s not every one who can\\ndistinguish between a demi and a duchess. there now, i believe i’ve\\nshocked you again! you’ve been dug out of the backwoods, you have. not\\nthat i mind that. we could do with a few more of your sort. i just hate\\na fellow who gets fresh. it makes me mad.”\\n\\nshe shook her head vigorously.\\n\\n“what are you like when you’re mad?” i inquired with a smile.\\n\\n“a regular little devil! don’t care what i say, or what i do, either! i\\nnearly did a chap in once. yes, really. he’d have deserved it too.\\nitalian blood i’ve got. i shall get into trouble one of these days.”\\n\\n“well,” i begged, “don’t get mad with me.”\\n\\n“i shan’t. i like you—did the first moment i set eyes on you. but you\\nlooked so disapproving that i never thought we should make friends.”\\n\\n“well, we have. tell me something about yourself.”\\n\\n“i’m an actress. no—not the kind you’re thinking of, lunching at the\\nsavoy covered with jewellery, and with their photograph in every paper\\nsaying how much they love madame so and so’s face cream. i’ve been on\\nthe boards since i was a kid of six—tumbling.”\\n\\n“i beg your pardon,” i said puzzled.\\n\\n“haven’t you seen child acrobats?”\\n\\n“oh, i understand.”\\n\\n“i’m american born, but i’ve spent most of my life in england. we got a\\nnew show now—”\\n\\n“we?”\\n\\n“my sister and i. sort of song and dance, and a bit of patter, and a\\ndash of the old business thrown in. it’s quite a new idea, and it hits\\nthem every time. there’s to be money in it—”\\n\\nmy new acquaintance leaned forward, and discoursed volubly, a great\\nmany of her terms being quite unintelligible to me. yet i found myself\\nevincing an increasing interest in her. she seemed such a curious\\nmixture of child and woman. though perfectly worldly-wise, and able, as\\nshe expressed it, to take care of herself, there was yet something\\ncuriously ingenuous in her single-minded attitude towards life, and her\\nwhole-hearted determination to “make good.” this glimpse of a world\\nunknown to me was not without its charm, and i enjoyed seeing her vivid\\nlittle face light up as she talked.\\n\\nwe passed through amiens. the name awakened many memories. my companion\\nseemed to have an intuitive knowledge of what was in my mind.\\n\\n“thinking of the war?”\\n\\ni nodded.\\n\\n“you were through it, i suppose?”\\n\\n“pretty well. i was wounded once, and after the somme they invalided me\\nout altogether. i had a half fledged army job for a bit. i’m a sort of\\nprivate secretary now to an m. p.”\\n\\n“my! that’s brainy!”\\n\\n“no, it isn’t. there’s really awfully little to do. usually a couple of\\nhours every day sees me through. it’s dull work too. in fact, i don’t\\nknow what i should do if i hadn’t got something to fall back upon.”\\n\\n“don’t say you collect bugs!”\\n\\n“no. i share rooms with a very interesting man. he’s a belgian—an\\nex-detective. he’s set up as a private detective in london, and he’s\\ndoing extraordinarily well. he’s really a very marvellous little man.\\ntime and again he has proved to be right where the official police have\\nfailed.”\\n\\nmy companion listened with widening eyes.\\n\\n“isn’t that interesting, now? i just adore crime. i go to all the\\nmysteries on the movies. and when there’s a murder on i just devour the\\npapers.”\\n\\n“do you remember the styles case?” i asked.\\n\\n“let me see, was that the old lady who was poisoned? somewhere down in\\nessex?”\\n\\ni nodded.\\n\\n“that was poirot’s first big case. undoubtedly, but for him, the\\nmurderer would have escaped scot-free. it was a most wonderful bit of\\ndetective work.”\\n\\nwarming to my subject, i ran over the heads of the affair, working up\\nto the triumphant and unexpected dénouement. the girl listened\\nspellbound. in fact, we were so absorbed that the train drew into\\ncalais station before we realized it.\\n\\n“my goodness gracious me!” cried my companion. “where’s my\\npowder-puff?”\\n\\nshe proceeded to bedaub her face liberally, and then applied a stick of\\nlip salve to her lips, observing the effect in a small pocket glass,\\nand betraying not the faintest sign of self-consciousness.\\n\\n“i say,” i hesitated. “i dare say it’s cheek on my part, but why do all\\nthat sort of thing?”\\n\\nthe girl paused in her operations, and stared at me with undisguised\\nsurprise.\\n\\n“it isn’t as though you weren’t so pretty that you can afford to do\\nwithout it,” i said stammeringly.\\n\\n“my dear boy! i’ve got to do it. all the girls do. think i want to look\\nlike a little frump up from the country?” she took one last look in the\\nmirror, smiled approval, and put it and her vanity-box away in her bag.\\n“that’s better. keeping up appearances is a bit of a fag, i grant, but\\nif a girl respects herself it’s up to her not to let herself get\\nslack.”\\n\\nto this essentially moral sentiment, i had no reply. a point of view\\nmakes a great difference.\\n\\ni secured a couple of porters, and we alighted on the platform. my\\ncompanion held out her hand.\\n\\n“good-bye, and i’ll mind my language better in future.”\\n\\n“oh, but surely you’ll let me look after you on the boat?”\\n\\n“mayn’t be on the boat. i’ve got to see whether that sister of mine got\\naboard after all anywhere. but thanks all the same.”\\n\\n“oh, but we’re going to meet again, surely? i—” i hesitated. “i want to\\nmeet your sister.”\\n\\nwe both laughed.\\n\\n“that’s real nice of you. i’ll tell her what you say. but i don’t fancy\\nwe’ll meet again. you’ve been very good to me on the journey,\\nespecially after i cheeked you as i did. but what your face expressed\\nfirst thing is quite true. i’m not your kind. and that brings\\ntrouble—_i___ know that well enough.\\u200a…”\\n\\nher face changed. for the moment all the light-hearted gaiety died out\\nof it. it looked angry—revengeful.\\u200a…\\n\\n“so good-bye,” she finished, in a lighter tone.\\n\\n“aren’t you even going to tell me your name?” i cried, as she turned\\naway.\\n\\nshe looked over her shoulder. a dimple appeared in each cheek. she was\\nlike a lovely picture by greuze.\\n\\n“cinderella,” she said, and laughed.\\n\\nbut little did i think when and how i should see cinderella again.\\n\\n\\n\\n2 an appeal for help\\n\\nit was five minutes past nine when i entered our joint sitting-room for\\nbreakfast on the following morning.\\n\\nmy friend poirot, exact to the minute as usual, was just tapping the\\nshell of his second egg.\\n\\nhe beamed upon me as i entered.\\n\\n“you have slept well, yes? you have recovered from the crossing so\\nterrible? it is a marvel, almost you are exact this morning.\\n_pardon___, but your tie is not symmetrical. permit that i rearrange\\nhim.”\\n\\nelsewhere, i have described hercule poirot. an extraordinary little\\nman! height, five feet four inches, egg-shaped head carried a little to\\none side, eyes that shone green when he was excited, stiff military\\nmoustache, air of dignity immense! he was neat and dandified in\\nappearance. for neatness of any kind, he had an absolute passion. to\\nsee an ornament set crooked, or a speck of dust, or a slight disarray\\nin one’s attire, was torture to the little man until he could ease his\\nfeelings by remedying the matter. “order” and “method” were his gods.\\nhe had a certain disdain for tangible evidence, such as footprints and\\ncigarette ash, and would maintain that, taken by themselves, they would\\nnever enable a detective to solve a problem. then he would tap his\\negg-shaped head with absurd complacency, and remark with great\\nsatisfaction: “the true work, it is done from _within___. _the little\\ngrey cells___—remember always the little grey cells, _mon ami!___”\\n\\ni slipped into my seat, and remarked idly, in answer to poirot’s\\ngreeting, that an hour’s sea passage from calais to dover could hardly\\nbe dignified by the epithet “terrible.”\\n\\npoirot waved his egg-spoon in vigorous refutation of my remark.\\n\\n“_du tout!___ if for an hour one experiences sensations and emotions of\\nthe most terrible, one has lived many hours! does not one of your\\nenglish poets say that time is counted, not by hours, but by\\nheart-beats?”\\n\\n“i fancy browning was referring to something more romantic than sea\\nsickness, though.”\\n\\n“because he was an englishman, an islander to whom _la manche___ was\\nnothing. oh, you english! with _nous autres___ it is different. figure\\nto yourself that a lady of my acquaintance at the beginning of the war\\nfled to ostend. there she had a terrible crisis of the nerves.\\nimpossible to escape further except by crossing the sea! and she had a\\nhorror—_mais une horreur!___—of the sea! what was she to do? daily _les\\nboches___ were drawing nearer. imagine to yourself the terrible\\nsituation!”\\n\\n“what did she do?” i inquired curiously.\\n\\n“fortunately her husband was _homme pratique___. he was also very calm,\\nthe crises of the nerves, they affected him not. _il l’a emportée\\nsimplement!___ naturally when she reached england she was prostrate,\\nbut she still breathed.”\\n\\npoirot shook his head seriously. i composed my face as best i could.\\n\\nsuddenly he stiffened and pointed a dramatic finger at the toast rack.\\n\\n“ah, par exemple, c’est trop fort!” he cried.\\n\\n“what is it?”\\n\\n“this piece of toast. you remark him not?” he whipped the offender out\\nof the rack, and held it up for me to examine.\\n\\n“is it square? no. is it a triangle? again no. is it even round? no. is\\nit of any shape remotely pleasing to the eye? what symmetry have we\\nhere? none.”\\n\\n“it’s cut from a cottage loaf,” i explained soothingly.\\n\\npoirot threw me a withering glance.\\n\\n“what an intelligence has my friend hastings!” he exclaimed\\nsarcastically. “comprehend you not that i have forbidden such a loaf—a\\nloaf haphazard and shapeless, that no baker should permit himself to\\nbake!”\\n\\ni endeavoured to distract his mind.\\n\\n“anything interesting come by the post?”\\n\\npoirot shook his head with a dissatisfied air.\\n\\n“i have not yet examined my letters, but nothing of interest arrives\\nnowadays. the great criminals, the criminals of method, they do not\\nexist. the cases i have been employed upon lately were _banal___ to the\\nlast degree. in verity i am reduced to recovering lost lap-dogs for\\nfashionable ladies! the last problem that presented any interest was\\nthat intricate little affair of the yardly diamond, and that was—how\\nmany months ago, my friend?”\\n\\nhe shook his head despondently, and i roared with laughter.\\n\\n“cheer up, poirot, the luck will change. open your letters. for all you\\nknow, there may be a great case looming on the horizon.”\\n\\npoirot smiled, and taking up the neat little letter opener with which\\nhe opened his correspondence he slit the tops of the several envelopes\\nthat lay by his plate.\\n\\n“a bill. another bill. it is that i grow extravagant in my old age.\\naha! a note from japp.”\\n\\n“yes?” pricked up my ears. the scotland yard inspector had more than\\nonce introduced us to an interesting case.\\n\\n“he merely thanks me (in his fashion) for a little point in the\\naberystwyth case on which i was able to set him right. i am delighted\\nto have been of service to him.”\\n\\n“how does he thank you?” i asked curiously, for i knew my japp.\\n\\n“he is kind enough to say that i am a wonderful sport for my age, and\\nthat he was glad to have had the chance of letting me in on the case.”\\n\\nthis was so typical of japp, that i could not forbear a chuckle. poirot\\ncontinued to read his correspondence placidly.\\n\\n“a suggestion that i should give a lecture to our local boy scouts. the\\ncountess of forfanock will be obliged if i will call and see her.\\nanother lap-dog without doubt! and now for the last. ah—”\\n\\ni looked up, quick to notice the change of tone. poirot was reading\\nattentively. in a minute he tossed the sheet over to me.\\n\\n“this is out of the ordinary, _mon ami___. read for yourself.”\\n\\nthe letter was written on a foreign type of paper, in a bold\\ncharacteristic hand:\\n\\n“villa geneviève\\nmerlinville-sur-mer\\nfrance\\n\\n\\n“_dear sir___,\\n“i am in need of the services of a detective and, for reasons which i\\nwill give you later, do not wish to call in the official police. i have\\nheard of you from several quarters, and all reports go to show that you\\nare not only a man of decided ability, but one who also knows how to be\\ndiscreet. i do not wish to trust details to the post, but, on account\\nof a secret i possess, i go in daily fear of my life. i am convinced\\nthat the danger is imminent, and therefore i beg that you will lose no\\ntime in crossing to france. i will send a car to meet you at calais, if\\nyou will wire me when you are arriving. i shall be obliged if you will\\ndrop all cases you have on hand, and devote yourself solely to my\\ninterests. i am prepared to pay any compensation necessary. i shall\\nprobably need your services for a considerable period of time, as it\\nmay be necessary for you to go out to santiago, where i spent several\\nyears of my life. i shall be content for you to name your own fee.\\n    “assuring you once more that the matter is _urgent___,\\n\\n\\n“yours faithfully\\n“p. t. renauld.”\\n\\n\\nbelow the signature was a hastily scrawled line, almost illegible: “for\\ngod’s sake, come!”\\n\\ni handed the letter back with quickened pulses.\\n\\n“at last!” i said. “here is something distinctly out of the ordinary.”\\n\\n“yes, indeed,” said poirot meditatively.\\n\\n“you will go of course,” i continued.\\n\\npoirot nodded. he was thinking deeply. finally he seemed to make up his\\nmind, and glanced up at the clock. his face was very grave.\\n\\n“see you, my friend, there is no time to lose. the continental express\\nleaves victoria at 11 o’clock. do not agitate yourself. there is plenty\\nof time. we can allow ten minutes for discussion. you accompany me,\\n_n’est-ce pas?___”\\n\\n“well—”\\n\\n“you told me yourself that your employer needed you not for the next\\nfew weeks.”\\n\\n“oh, that’s all right. but this mr. renauld hints strongly that his\\nbusiness is private.”\\n\\n“ta-ta-ta. i will manage m. renauld. by the way, i seem to know the\\nname?”\\n\\n“there’s a well-known south american millionaire fellow. his name’s\\nrenauld. i don’t know whether it could be the same.”\\n\\n“but without doubt. that explains the mention of santiago. santiago is\\nin chile, and chile it is in south america! ah, but we progress\\nfinely.”\\n\\n“dear me, poirot,” i said, my excitement rising, “i smell some goodly\\nshekels in this. if we succeed, we shall make our fortunes!”\\n\\n“do not be too sure of that, my friend. a rich man and his money are\\nnot so easily parted. me, i have seen a well-known millionaire turn out\\na tramful of people to seek for a dropped halfpenny.”\\n\\ni acknowledged the wisdom of this.\\n\\n“in any case,” continued poirot, “it is not the money which attracts me\\nhere. certainly it will be pleasant to have _carte blanche___ in our\\ninvestigations; one can be sure that way of wasting no time, but it is\\nsomething a little bizarre in this problem which arouses my interest.\\nyou remarked the postscript? how did it strike you?”\\n\\ni considered.\\n\\n“clearly he wrote the letter keeping himself well in hand, but at the\\nend his self-control snapped and, on the impulse of the moment, he\\nscrawled those four desperate words.”\\n\\nbut my friend shook his head energetically.\\n\\n“you are in error. see you not that while the ink of the signature is\\nnearly black, that of the postscript is quite pale?”\\n\\n“well?” i said puzzled.\\n\\n“_mon dieu, mon ami___, but use your little grey cells! is it not\\nobvious? m. renauld wrote his letter. without blotting it, he reread it\\ncarefully. then, not on impulse, but deliberately, he added those last\\nwords, and blotted the sheet.”\\n\\n“but why?”\\n\\n“_parbleu!___ so that it should produce the effect upon me that it has\\nupon you.”\\n\\n“what?”\\n\\n“_mais, oui___—to make sure of my coming! he reread the letter and was\\ndissatisfied. it was not strong enough!”\\n\\nhe paused, and then added softly, his eyes shining with that green\\nlight that always betokened inward excitement: “and so, _mon ami___,\\nsince that postscript was added, not on impulse, but soberly, in cold\\nblood, the urgency is very great, and we must reach him as soon as\\npossible.”\\n\\n“merlinville,” i murmured thoughtfully. “i’ve heard of it, i think.”\\n\\npoirot nodded.\\n\\n“it is a quiet little place—but chic! it lies about midway between\\nbolougne and calais. it is rapidly becoming the fashion. rich english\\npeople who wish to be quiet are taking it up. m. renauld has a house in\\nengland, i suppose?”\\n\\n“yes, in rutland gate, as far as i remember. also a big place in the\\ncountry, somewhere in hertfordshire. but i really know very little\\nabout him, he doesn’t do much in a social way. i believe he has large\\nsouth american interests in the city, and has spent most of his life\\nout in chile and the argentino.”\\n\\n“well, we shall hear all details from the man himself. come, let us\\npack. a small suit-case each, and then a taxi to victoria.”\\n\\n“and the countess?” i inquired with a smile.\\n\\n“ah! _je m’en fiche!___ her case was certainly not interesting.”\\n\\n“why so sure of that?”\\n\\n“because in that case she would have come, not written. a woman cannot\\nwait—always remember that, hastings.”\\n\\neleven o’clock saw our departure from victoria on our way to dover.\\nbefore starting poirot had despatched a telegram to mr. renauld giving\\nthe time of our arrival at calais. “i’m surprised you haven’t invested\\nin a few bottles of some sea sick remedy, poirot,” i observed\\nmaliciously, as i recalled our conversation at breakfast.\\n\\nmy friend, who was anxiously scanning the weather, turned a reproachful\\nface upon me.\\n\\n“is it that you have forgotten the method most excellent of laverguier?\\nhis system, i practise it always. one balances oneself, if you\\nremember, turning the head from left to right, breathing in and out,\\ncounting six between each breath.”\\n\\n“h’m,” i demurred. “you’ll be rather tired of balancing yourself and\\ncounting six by the time you get to santiago, or buenos ayres, or\\nwherever it is you land.”\\n\\n“_quelle idée!___ you do not figure to yourself that i shall go to\\nsantiago?”\\n\\n“mr. renauld suggests it in his letter.”\\n\\n“he did not know the methods of hercule poirot. i do not run to and\\nfro, making journeys, and agitating myself. my work is done from\\nwithin—_here___—” he tapped his forehead significantly.\\n\\nas usual, this remark roused my argumentative faculty.\\n\\n“it’s all very well, poirot, but i think you are falling into the habit\\nof despising certain things too much. a finger-print has led sometimes\\nto the arrest and conviction of a murderer.”\\n\\n“and has, without doubt, hanged more than one innocent man,” remarked\\npoirot dryly.\\n\\n“but surely the study of finger-prints and footprints, cigarette ash,\\ndifferent kinds of mud, and other clues that comprise the minute\\nobservation of details—all these are of vital importance?”\\n\\n“but certainly. i have never said otherwise. the trained observer, the\\nexpert, without doubt he is useful! but the others, the hercules\\npoirots, they are above the experts! to them the experts bring the\\nfacts, their business is the method of the crime, its logical\\ndeduction, the proper sequence and order of the facts; above all, the\\ntrue psychology of the case. you have hunted the fox, yes?”\\n\\n“i have hunted a bit, now and again,” i said, rather bewildered by this\\nabrupt change of subject. “why?”\\n\\n“_eh bien___, this hunting of the fox, you need the dogs, no?”\\n\\n“hounds,” i corrected gently. “yes, of course.”\\n\\n“but yet,” poirot wagged his finger at me. “you did not descend from\\nyour horse and run along the ground smelling with your nose and\\nuttering loud ow ows?”\\n\\nin spite of myself i laughed immoderately. poirot nodded in a satisfied\\nmanner.\\n\\n“so. you leave the work of the d— hounds to the hounds. yet you demand\\nthat i, hercule poirot, should make myself ridiculous by lying down\\n(possibly on damp grass) to study hypothetical footprints, and should\\nscoop up cigarette ash when i do not know one kind from the other.\\nremember the plymouth express mystery. the good japp departed to make a\\nsurvey of the railway line. when he returned, i, without having moved\\nfrom my apartments, was able to tell him exactly what he had found.”\\n\\n“so you are of the opinion that japp wasted his time.”\\n\\n“not at all, since his evidence confirmed my theory. but _i___ should\\nhave wasted my time if _i___ had gone. it is the same with so called\\n‘experts.’ remember the handwriting testimony in the cavendish case.\\none counsel’s questioning brings out testimony as to the resemblances,\\nthe defence brings evidence to show dissimilarity. all the language is\\nvery technical. and the result? what we all knew in the first place.\\nthe writing was very like that of john cavendish. and the psychological\\nmind is faced with the question ‘why?’ because it was actually his? or\\nbecause some one wished us to think it was his? i answered that\\nquestion, _mon ami___, and answered it correctly.”\\n\\nand poirot, having effectually silenced, if not convinced me, leaned\\nback with a satisfied air.\\n\\non the boat, i knew better than to disturb my friend’s solitude. the\\nweather was gorgeous, and the sea as smooth as the proverbial\\nmill-pond, so i was hardly surprised to hear that laverguier’s method\\nhad once more justified itself when a smiling poirot joined me on\\ndisembarking at calais. a disappointment was in store for us, as no car\\nhad been sent to meet us, but poirot put this down to his telegram\\nhaving been delayed in transit.\\n\\n“since it is _carte blanche___, we will hire a car,” he said\\ncheerfully. and a few minutes later saw us creaking and jolting along,\\nin the most ramshackle of automobiles that ever plied for hire, in the\\ndirection of merlinville.\\n\\nmy spirits were at their highest.\\n\\n“what gorgeous air!” i exclaimed. “this promises to be a delightful\\ntrip.”\\n\\n“for you, yes. for me, i have work to do, remember, at our journey’s\\nend.”\\n\\n“bah!” i said cheerfully. “you will discover all, ensure this mr.\\nrenauld’s safety, run the would-be assassins to earth, and all will\\nfinish in a blaze of glory.”\\n\\n“you are sanguine, my friend.”\\n\\n“yes, i feel absolutely assured of success. are you not the one and\\nonly hercule poirot?”\\n\\nbut my little friend did not rise to the bait. he was observing me\\ngravely.\\n\\n“you are what the scotch people call ‘fey,’ hastings. it presages\\ndisaster.”\\n\\n“nonsense. at any rate, you do not share my feelings.”\\n\\n“no, but i am afraid.”\\n\\n“afraid of what?”\\n\\n“i do not know. but i have a premonition—a _je ne sais quoi!___”\\n\\nhe spoke so gravely, that i was impressed in spite of myself.\\n\\n“i have a feeling,” he said slowly, “that this is going to be a big\\naffair—a long, troublesome problem that will not be easy to work out.”\\n\\ni would have questioned him further, but we were just coming into the\\nlittle town of merlinville, and we slowed up to inquire the way to the\\nvilla geneviève.\\n\\n“straight on, monsieur, through the town. the villa geneviève is about\\nhalf a mile the other side. you cannot miss it. a big villa,\\noverlooking the sea.”\\n\\nwe thanked our informant, and drove on, leaving the town behind. a fork\\nin the road brought us to a second halt. a peasant was trudging towards\\nus, and we waited for him to come up to us in order to ask the way\\nagain. there was a tiny villa standing right by the road, but it was\\ntoo small and dilapidated to be the one we wanted. as we waited, the\\ngate of it swung open and a girl came out.\\n\\nthe peasant was passing us now, and the driver leaned forward from his\\nseat and asked for direction.\\n\\n“the villa geneviève? just a few steps up this road to the right,\\nmonsieur. you could see it if it were not for the curve.”\\n\\nthe chauffeur thanked him, and started the car again. my eyes were\\nfascinated by the girl who still stood, with one hand on the gate,\\nwatching us. i am an admirer of beauty, and here was one whom nobody\\ncould have passed without remark. very tall, with the proportions of a\\nyoung goddess, her uncovered golden head gleaming in the sunlight, i\\nswore to myself that she was one of the most beautiful girls i had ever\\nseen. as we swung up the rough road, i turned my head to look after\\nher.\\n\\n“by jove, poirot,” i exclaimed, “did you see that young goddess.”\\n\\npoirot raised his eyebrows.\\n\\n“_ça commence!___” he murmured. “already you have seen a goddess!”\\n\\n“but, hang it all, wasn’t she?”\\n\\n“possibly. i did not remark the fact.”\\n\\n“surely you noticed her?”\\n\\n“_mon ami___, two people rarely see the same thing. you, for instance,\\nsaw a goddess. i—” he hesitated.\\n\\n“yes?”\\n\\n“i saw only a girl with anxious eyes,” said poirot gravely.\\n\\nbut at that moment we drew up at a big green gate, and, simultaneously,\\nwe both uttered an exclamation. before it stood an imposing _sergent de\\nville___. he held up his hand to bar our way.\\n\\n“you cannot pass, monsieurs.”\\n\\n“but we wish to see mr. renauld,” i cried. “we have an appointment.\\nthis is his villa, isn’t it?”\\n\\n“yes, monsieur, but—”\\n\\npoirot leaned forward.\\n\\n“but what?”\\n\\n“m. renauld was murdered this morning.”\\n\\n\\n\\n3 at the villa geneviève\\n\\nin a moment poirot had leapt from the car, his eyes blazing with\\nexcitement. he caught the man by the shoulder.\\n\\n“what is that you say? murdered? when? how?”\\n\\nthe _sergent de ville___ drew himself up.\\n\\n“i cannot answer any questions, monsieur.”\\n\\n“true. i comprehend.” poirot reflected for a minute. “the commissary of\\npolice, he is without doubt within?”\\n\\n“yes, monsieur.”\\n\\npoirot took out a card, and scribbled a few words on it.\\n\\n“_voilà!___ will you have the goodness to see that this card is sent in\\nto the commissary at once?”\\n\\nthe man took it and, turning his head over his shoulder, whistled. in a\\nfew seconds a comrade joined him and was handed poirot’s message. there\\nwas a wait of some minutes, and then a short stout man with a huge\\nmoustache came bustling down to the gate. the _sergent de ville___\\nsaluted and stood aside.\\n\\n“my dear m. poirot,” cried the new-comer, “i am delighted to see you.\\nyour arrival is most opportune.”\\n\\npoirot’s face had lighted up.\\n\\n“m. bex! this is indeed a pleasure.” he turned to me. “this is an\\nenglish friend of mine, captain hastings—m. lucien bex.”\\n\\nthe commissary and i bowed to each other ceremoniously, then m. bex\\nturned once more to poirot.\\n\\n“_mon vieux___, i have not seen you since 1909, that time in ostend. i\\nheard that you had left the force?”\\n\\n“so i have. i run a private business in london.”\\n\\n“and you say you have information to give which may assist us?”\\n\\n“possibly you know it already. you were aware that i had been sent\\nfor?”\\n\\n“no. by whom?”\\n\\n“the dead man. it seems he knew an attempt was going to be made on his\\nlife. unfortunately he sent for me too late.”\\n\\n“_sacri tonnerre!___” ejaculated the frenchman. “so he foresaw his own\\nmurder? that upsets our theories considerably! but come inside.”\\n\\nhe held the gate open, and we commenced walking towards the house. m.\\nbex continued to talk:\\n\\n“the examining magistrate, m. hautet, must hear of this at once. he has\\njust finished examining the scene of the crime and is about to begin\\nhis interrogations. a charming man. you will like him. most\\nsympathetic. original in his methods, but an excellent judge.”\\n\\n“when was the crime committed?” asked poirot.\\n\\n“the body was discovered this morning about nine o’clock. madame\\nrenauld’s evidence, and that of the doctors goes to show that the death\\nmust have occurred about 2 a.m. but enter, i pray of you.”\\n\\nwe had arrived at the steps which led up to the front door of the\\nvilla. in the hall another _sergent de ville___ was sitting. he rose at\\nsight of the commissary.\\n\\n“where is m. hautet now?” inquired the latter.\\n\\n“in the _salon___, monsieur.”\\n\\nm. bex opened a door to the left of the hall, and we passed in. m.\\nhautet and his clerk were sitting at a big round table. they looked up\\nas we entered. the commissary introduced us, and explained our\\npresence.\\n\\nm. hautet, the juge d’instruction, was a tall, gaunt man, with piercing\\ndark eyes, and a neatly cut grey beard, which he had a habit of\\ncaressing as he talked. standing by the mantelpiece was an elderly man,\\nwith slightly stooping shoulders, who was introduced to us as dr.\\ndurand.\\n\\n“most extraordinary,” remarked m. hautet, as the commissary finished\\nspeaking. “you have the letter here, monsieur?”\\n\\npoirot handed it to him, and the magistrate read it.\\n\\n“h’m. he speaks of a secret. what a pity he was not more explicit. we\\nare much indebted to you, m. poirot. i hope you will do us the honour\\nof assisting us in our investigations. or are you obliged to return to\\nlondon?”\\n\\n“m. le juge, i propose to remain. i did not arrive in time to prevent\\nmy client’s death, but i feel myself bound in honour to discover the\\nassassin.”\\n\\nthe magistrate bowed.\\n\\n“these sentiments do you honour. also, without doubt, madame renauld\\nwill wish to retain your services. we are expecting m. giraud from the\\nsûreté in paris any moment, and i am sure that you and he will be able\\nto give each other mutual assistance in your investigations. in the\\nmeantime, i hope that you will do me the honour to be present at my\\ninterrogations, and i need hardly say that if there is any assistance\\nyou require it is at your disposal.”\\n\\n“i thank you, monsieur. you will comprehend that at present i am\\ncompletely in the dark. i know nothing whatever.”\\n\\nm. hautet nodded to the commissary, and the latter took up the tale:\\n\\n“this morning, the old servant françoise, on descending to start her\\nwork, found the front door ajar. feeling a momentary alarm as to\\nburglars, she looked into the dining-room, but seeing the silver was\\nsafe she thought no more about it, concluding that her master had,\\nwithout doubt, risen early, and gone for a stroll.”\\n\\n“pardon, monsieur, for interrupting, but was that a common practice of\\nhis?”\\n\\n“no, it was not, but old françoise has the common idea as regards the\\nenglish—that they are mad, and liable to do the most unaccountable\\nthings at any moment! going to call her mistress as usual, a younger\\nmaid, léonie, was horrified to discover her gagged and bound, and\\nalmost at the same moment news was brought that m. renauld’s body had\\nbeen discovered, stone dead, stabbed in the back.”\\n\\n“where?”\\n\\n“that is one of the most extraordinary features of the case. m. poirot,\\nthe body was lying, face downwards, _in an open grave___.”\\n\\n“what?”\\n\\n“yes. the pit was freshly dug—just a few yards outside the boundary of\\nthe villa grounds.”\\n\\n“and he had been dead—how long?”\\n\\ndr. durand answered this.\\n\\n“i examined the body this morning at ten o’clock. death must have taken\\nplace at least seven, and possibly ten hours previously.”\\n\\n“h’m, that fixes it at between midnight and 3 a.m.”\\n\\n“exactly, and madame renauld’s evidence places it at after 2 a.m. which\\nnarrows the field still further. death must have been instantaneous,\\nand naturally could not have been self-inflicted.”\\n\\npoirot nodded, and the commissary resumed:\\n\\n“madame renauld was hastily freed from the cords that bound her by the\\nhorrified servants. she was in a terrible condition of weakness, almost\\nunconscious from the pain of her bonds. it appears that two masked men\\nentered the bedroom, gagged and bound her, whilst forcibly abducting\\nher husband. this we know at second hand from the servants. on hearing\\nthe tragic news, she fell at once into an alarming state of agitation.\\non arrival, dr. durand immediately prescribed a sedative, and we have\\nnot yet been able to question her. but without doubt she will awake\\nmore calm, and be equal to bearing the strain of the interrogation.”\\n\\nthe commissary paused.\\n\\n“and the inmates of the house, monsieur?”\\n\\n“there is old françoise, the housekeeper, she lived for many years with\\nthe former owners of the villa geneviève. then there are two young\\ngirls, sisters, denise and léonie oulard. their home is in merlinville,\\nand they come of the most respectable parents. then there is the\\nchauffeur whom m. renauld brought over from england with him, but he is\\naway on a holiday. finally there are madame renauld and her son, m.\\njack renauld. he, too, is away from home at present.”\\n\\npoirot bowed his head. m. hautet spoke:\\n\\n“marchaud!”\\n\\nthe _sergent de ville___ appeared.\\n\\n“bring in the woman françoise.”\\n\\nthe man saluted, and disappeared. in a moment or two, he returned,\\nescorting the frightened françoise.\\n\\n“you name is françoise arrichet?”\\n\\n“yes, monsieur.”\\n\\n“you have been a long time in service at the villa geneviève?”\\n\\n“eleven years with madame la vicomtesse. then when she sold the villa\\nthis spring, i consented to remain on with the english milor. never did\\ni imagine—”\\n\\nthe magistrate cut her short.\\n\\n“without doubt, without doubt. now, françoise, in this matter of the\\nfront door, whose business was it to fasten it at night?”\\n\\n“mine, monsieur. always i saw to it myself.”\\n\\n“and last night?”\\n\\n“i fastened it as usual.”\\n\\n“you are sure of that?”\\n\\n“i swear it by the blessed saints, monsieur.”\\n\\n“what time would that be?”\\n\\n“the same time as usual, half-past ten, monsieur.”\\n\\n“what about the rest of the household, had they gone up to bed?”\\n\\n“madame had retired some time before. denise and léonie went up with\\nme. monsieur was still in his study.”\\n\\n“then, if any one unfastened the door afterwards, it must have been m.\\nrenauld himself?”\\n\\nfrançoise shrugged her broad shoulders.\\n\\n“what should he do that for? with robbers and assassins passing every\\nminute! a nice idea! monsieur was not an imbecile. it is not as though\\nhe had had to let _cette dame___ out—”\\n\\nthe magistrate interrupted sharply:\\n\\n“_cette dame?___ what lady do you mean?”\\n\\n“why, the lady who came to see him.”\\n\\n“had a lady been to see him that evening?”\\n\\n“but yes, monsieur—and many other evenings as well.”\\n\\n“who was she? did you know her?”\\n\\na rather cunning look spread over the woman’s face. “how should i know\\nwho it was?” she grumbled. “i did not let her in last night.”\\n\\n“aha!” roared the examining magistrate, bringing his hand down with a\\nbang on the table. “you would trifle with the police, would you? i\\ndemand that you tell me at once the name of this woman who came to\\nvisit m. renauld in the evenings.”\\n\\n“the police—the police,” grumbled françoise. “never did i think that i\\nshould be mixed up with the police. but i know well enough who she was.\\nit was madame daubreuil.”\\n\\nthe commissary uttered an exclamation, and leaned forward as though in\\nutter astonishment.\\n\\n“madame daubreuil—from the villa marguerite just down the road?”\\n\\n“that is what i said, monsieur. oh, she is a pretty one, _cellela!___”\\nthe old woman tossed her head scornfully.\\n\\n“madame daubreuil,” murmured the commissary. “impossible.”\\n\\n“_voilà,___” grumbled françoise. “that is all you get for telling the\\ntruth.”\\n\\n“not at all,” said the examining magistrate soothingly. “we were\\nsurprised, that is all. madame daubreuil then, and monsieur renauld,\\nthey were—” he paused delicately. “eh? it was that without doubt?”\\n\\n“how should i know? but what will you? monsieur, he was _milor\\nanglais___—_trés riche___—and madame daubreuil, she was poor, that\\none—and _trés chic___ for all that she lives so quietly with her\\ndaughter. not a doubt of it, she has had her history! she is no longer\\nyoung, but _ma foi!___ i who speak to you have seen the men’s heads\\nturn after her as she goes down the street. besides lately, she has had\\nmore money to spend—all the town knows it. the little economies, they\\nare at an end.” and françoise shook her head with an air of unalterable\\ncertainty.\\n\\nm. hautet stroked his beard reflectively.\\n\\n“and madame renauld?” he asked at length. “how did she take\\nthis—friendship.”\\n\\nfrançoise shrugged her shoulders.\\n\\n“she was always most amiable—most polite. one would say that she\\nsuspected nothing. but all the same, is it not so, the heart suffers,\\nmonsieur? day by day, i have watched madame grow paler and thinner. she\\nwas not the same woman who arrived here a month ago. monsieur, too, has\\nchanged. he also has had his worries. one could see that he was on the\\nbrink of a crisis of the nerves. and who could wonder, with an affair\\nconducted such a fashion? no reticence, no discretion. _style\\nanglais___, without doubt!”\\n\\ni bounded indignantly in my seat, but the examining magistrate was\\ncontinuing his questions, undistracted by side issues.\\n\\n“you say that m. renauld had not to let madame daubreuil out? had she\\nleft, then?”\\n\\n“yes, monsieur. i heard them come out of the study and go to the door.\\nmonsieur said good night, and shut the door after her.”\\n\\n“what time was that?”\\n\\n“about twenty-five minutes after ten, monsieur.”\\n\\n“do you know when m. renauld went to bed?”\\n\\n“i heard him come up about ten minutes after we did. the stair creaks\\nso that one hears every one who goes up and down.”\\n\\n“and that is all? you heard no sound of disturbance during the night?”\\n\\n“nothing whatever, monsieur.”\\n\\n“which of the servants came down the first in the morning?”\\n\\n“i did, monsieur. at once i saw the door swinging open.”\\n\\n“what about the other downstairs windows, were they all fastened?”\\n\\n“every one of them. there was nothing suspicious or out of place\\nanywhere.”\\n\\n“good, françoise, you can go.”\\n\\nthe old woman shuffled towards the door. on the threshold she looked\\nback.\\n\\n“i will tell you one thing, monsieur. that madame daubreuil she is a\\nbad one! oh, yes, one woman knows about another. she is a bad one,\\nremember that.” and, shaking her head sagely, françoise left the room.\\n\\n“léonie oulard,” called the magistrate.\\n\\nléonie appeared dissolved in tears, and inclined to be hysterical. m.\\nhautet dealt with her adroitly. her evidence was mainly concerned with\\nthe discovery of her mistress gagged and bound, of which she gave\\nrather an exaggerated account. she, like françoise, had heard nothing\\nduring the night.\\n\\nher sister, denise, succeeded her. she agreed that her master had\\nchanged greatly of late.\\n\\n“every day he became more and more morose. he ate less. he was always\\ndepressed.” but denise had her own theory. “without doubt it was the\\nmafia he had on his track! two masked men—who else could it be? a\\nterrible society that!”\\n\\n“it is, of course, possible,” said the magistrate smoothly. “now, my\\ngirl, was it you who admitted madame daubreuil to the house last\\nnight?”\\n\\n“not _last___ night, monsieur, the night before.”\\n\\n“but françoise has just told us that madame daubreuil was here last\\nnight?”\\n\\n“no, monsieur. a lady _did___ come to see m. renauld last night, but it\\nwas not madame daubreuil.”\\n\\nsurprised, the magistrate insisted, but the girl held firm. she knew\\nmadame daubreuil perfectly by sight. this lady was dark also, but\\nshorter, and much younger. nothing could shake her statement.\\n\\n“had you ever seen this lady before?”\\n\\n“never, monsieur.” and then the girl added diffidently: “but i think\\nshe was english.”\\n\\n“english?”\\n\\n“yes, monsieur. she asked for m. renauld in quite good french, but the\\naccent—one can always tell it, _n’est-ce pas?___ besides when they came\\nout of the study they were speaking in english.”\\n\\n“did you hear what they said? could you understand it, i mean?”\\n\\n“me, i speak the english very well,” said denise with pride. “the lady\\nwas speaking too fast for me to catch what she said, but i heard\\nmonsieur’s last words as he opened the door for her.” she paused, and\\nthen repeated carefully and laboriously:\\n\\n“\\u200a‘yeas—yeas—butt for gaud’s saike go nauw!’\\u200a”\\n\\n“yes, yes, but for god’s sake go now!” repeated the magistrate.\\n\\nhe dismissed denise and, after a moment or two for consideration,\\nrecalled françoise. to her he propounded the question as to whether she\\nhad not made a mistake in fixing the night of madame daubreuil’s visit.\\nfrançoise, however, proved unexpectedly obstinate. it was last night\\nthat madame daubreuil had come. without a doubt it was she. denise\\nwished to make herself interesting, _voilà tout!___ so she had cooked\\nup this fine tale about a strange lady. airing her knowledge of english\\ntoo! probably monsieur had never spoken that sentence in english at\\nall, and even if he had, it proved nothing, for madame daubreuil spoke\\nenglish perfectly, and generally used that language when talking to m.\\nand madame renauld. “you see, m. jack, the son of monsieur, was usually\\nhere, and he spoke the french very badly.”\\n\\nthe magistrate did not insist. instead he inquired about the chauffeur,\\nand learned that only yesterday, m. renauld had declared that he was\\nnot likely to use the car, and that masters might just as well take a\\nholiday.\\n\\na perplexed frown was beginning to gather between poirot’s eyes.\\n\\n“what is it?” i whispered.\\n\\nhe shook his head impatiently, and asked a question:\\n\\n“pardon, m. bex, but without doubt m. renauld could drive the car\\nhimself?”\\n\\nthe commissary looked over at françoise, and the old woman replied\\npromptly:\\n\\n“no, monsieur did not drive himself.”\\n\\npoirot’s frown deepened.\\n\\n“i wish you would tell me what is worrying you,” i said impatiently.\\n\\n“see you not? in his letter m. renauld speaks of sending the car for me\\nto calais.”\\n\\n“perhaps he meant a hired car,” i suggested.\\n\\n“doubtless that is so. but why hire a car when you have one of your\\nown. why choose yesterday to send away the chauffeur on a\\nholiday—suddenly, at a moment’s notice? was it that for some reason he\\nwanted him out of the way before we arrived?”\\n\\n\\n\\n4 the letter signed “bella”\\n\\nfrançoise had left the room. the magistrate was drumming thoughtfully\\non the table.\\n\\n“m. bex,” he said at length, “here we have directly conflicting\\ntestimony. which are we to believe, françoise or denise?”\\n\\n“denise,” said the commissary decidedly. “it was she who let the\\nvisitor in. françoise is old and obstinate, and has evidently taken a\\ndislike to madame daubreuil. besides, our own knowledge tends to show\\nthat renauld was entangled with another woman.”\\n\\n“_tiens!___” cried m. hautet. “we have forgotten to inform m. poirot of\\nthat.” he searched amongst the papers on the table, and finally handed\\nthe one he was in search of to my friend. “this letter, m. poirot, we\\nfound in the pocket of the dead man’s overcoat.”\\n\\npoirot took it and unfolded it. it was somewhat worn and crumbled, and\\nwas written in english in a rather unformed hand:\\n\\n“_my dearest one:___”\\nwhy have you not written for so long? you do love me still, don’t you?\\nyour letters lately have been so different, cold and strange, and now\\nthis long silence. it makes me afraid. if you were to stop loving me!\\nbut that’s impossible—what a silly kid i am—always imagining things!\\nbut if you _did___ stop loving me, i don’t know what i should do—kill\\nmyself perhaps! i couldn’t live without you. sometimes i fancy another\\nwoman is coming between us. let her look out, that’s all—and you too!\\ni’d as soon kill you as let her have you! i mean it.\\n    “but there, i’m writing high-flown nonsense. you love me, and i\\n    love you—yes, love you, love you, love you!\\n\\n\\n“your own adoring\\n“bella.”\\n\\n\\nthere was no address or date. poirot handed it back with a grave face.\\n\\n“and the assumption is, m. le juge—?”\\n\\nthe examining magistrate shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n“obviously m. renauld was entangled with this englishwoman—bella. he\\ncomes over here, meets madame daubreuil, and starts an intrigue with\\nher. he cools off to the other, and she instantly suspects something.\\nthis letter contains a distinct threat. m. poirot, at first sight the\\ncase seemed simplicity itself. jealousy! the fact that m. renauld was\\nstabbed in the back seemed to point distinctly to its being a woman’s\\ncrime.”\\n\\npoirot nodded.\\n\\n“the stab in the back, yes—but not the grave! that was laborious work,\\nhard work—no woman dug that grave, monsieur. that was a man’s doing.”\\n\\nthe commissary exclaimed excitedly: “yes, yes, you are right. we did\\nnot think of that.”\\n\\n“as i said,” continued m. hautet, “at first sight the case seemed\\nsimple, but the masked men, and the letter you received from m. renauld\\ncomplicate matters. here we seem to have an entirely different set of\\ncircumstances, with no relationship between the two. as regards the\\nletter written to yourself, do you think it is possible that it\\nreferred in any way to this ‘bella,’ and her threats?”\\n\\npoirot shook his head.\\n\\n“hardly. a man like m. renauld, who has led an adventurous life in\\nout-of-the-way places, would not be likely to ask for protection\\nagainst a woman.”\\n\\nthe examining magistrate nodded his head emphatically.\\n\\n“my view exactly. then we must look for the explanation of the letter—”\\n\\n“in santiago,” finished the commissary. “i shall cable without delay to\\nthe police in that city, requesting full details of the murdered man’s\\nlife out there, his love affairs, his business transactions, his\\nfriendships, and any enmities he may have incurred. it will be strange\\nif, after that, we do not hold a clue to his mysterious murder.”\\n\\nthe commissary looked round for approval.\\n\\n“excellent,” said poirot appreciatively.\\n\\n“his wife, too, may be able to give us a pointer,” added the\\nmagistrate.\\n\\n“you have found no other letters from this bella amongst m. renauld’s\\neffects?” asked poirot.\\n\\n“no. of course one of our first proceedings was to search through his\\nprivate papers in the study. we found nothing of interest, however. all\\nseemed square and above-board. the only thing at all out of the\\nordinary was his will. here it is.”\\n\\npoirot ran through the document.\\n\\n“so. a legacy of a thousand pounds to mr. stonor—who is he, by the\\nway?”\\n\\n“m. renauld’s secretary. he remained in england, but was over here once\\nor twice for a week-end.”\\n\\n“and everything else left unconditionally to his beloved wife, eloise.\\nsimply drawn up, but perfectly legal. witnessed by the two servants,\\ndenise and françoise. nothing so very unusual about that.” he handed it\\nback.\\n\\n“perhaps,” began bex, “you did not notice—”\\n\\n“the date?” twinkled poirot. “but yes, i noticed it. a fortnight ago.\\npossibly it marks his first intimation of danger. many rich men die\\nintestate through never considering the likelihood of their demise. but\\nit is dangerous to draw conclusions prematurely. it points, however, to\\nhis having a real liking and fondness for his wife, in spite of his\\namorous intrigues.”\\n\\n“yes,” said m. hautet doubtfully. “but it is possibly a little unfair\\non his son, since it leaves him entirely dependent on his mother. if\\nshe were to marry again, and her second husband obtained an ascendancy\\nover her, this boy might never touch a penny of his father’s money.”\\n\\npoirot shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n“man is a vain animal. m. renauld figured to himself, without doubt,\\nthat his widow would never marry again. as to the son, it may have been\\na wise precaution to leave the money in his mother’s hands. the sons of\\nrich men are proverbially wild.”\\n\\n“it may be as you say. now, m. poirot, you would without doubt like to\\nvisit the scene of the crime. i am sorry that the body has been\\nremoved, but of course photographs have been taken from every\\nconceivable angle, and will be at your disposal as soon as they are\\navailable.”\\n\\n“i thank you, monsieur, for all your courtesy.”\\n\\nthe commissary rose.\\n\\n“come with me, monsieurs.”\\n\\nhe opened the door, and bowed ceremoniously to poirot to precede him.\\npoirot, with equal politeness, drew back and bowed to the commissary.\\n\\n“monsieur.”\\n\\n“monsieur.”\\n\\nat last they got out into the hall.\\n\\n“that room there, it is the study, _hein?___” asked poirot suddenly,\\nnodding towards the door opposite.\\n\\n“yes. you would like to see it?” he threw the door open as he spoke,\\nand we entered.\\n\\nthe room which m. renauld had chosen for his own particular use was\\nsmall, but furnished with great taste and comfort. a businesslike\\nwriting desk, with many pigeon holes, stood in the window. two large\\nleather-covered armchairs faced the fireplace, and between them was a\\nround table covered with the latest books and magazines. bookshelves\\nlined two of the walls, and at the end of the room opposite the window\\nthere was a handsome oak sideboard with a tantalus on top. the curtains\\nand _portière___ were of a soft dull green, and the carpet matched them\\nin tone.\\n\\npoirot stood a moment talking in the room, then he stepped forward,\\npassed his hand lightly over the backs of the leather chairs, picked up\\na magazine from the table, and drew a finger gingerly over the surface\\nof the oak sideboard. his face expressed complete approval.\\n\\n“no dust?” i asked, with a smile.\\n\\nhe beamed on me, appreciative of my knowledge of his peculiarities.\\n\\n“not a particle, _mon ami!___ and for once, perhaps, it is a pity.”\\n\\nhis sharp, birdlike eyes darted here and there.\\n\\n“ah!” he remarked suddenly, with an intonation of relief. “the\\nhearth-rug is crooked,” and he bent down to straighten it.\\n\\nsuddenly he uttered an exclamation and rose. in his hand he held a\\nsmall fragment of paper.\\n\\n“in france, as in england,” he remarked, “the domestics omit to sweep\\nunder the mats!”\\n\\nbex took the fragment from him, and i came closer to examine it.\\n\\n“you recognize it—eh, hastings?”\\n\\ni shook my head, puzzled—and yet that particular shade of pink paper\\nwas very familiar.\\n\\nthe commissary’s mental processes were quicker than mine.\\n\\n“a fragment of a cheque,” he exclaimed.\\n\\nthe piece of paper was roughly about two inches square. on it was\\nwritten in ink the word “duveen.”\\n\\n“_bien___,” said bex. “this cheque was payable to, or drawn by, one\\nnamed duveen.”\\n\\n“the former, i fancy,” said poirot, “for, if i am not mistaken, the\\nhandwriting is that of m. renauld.”\\n\\nthat was soon established, by comparing it with a memorandum from the\\ndesk.\\n\\n“dear me,” murmured the commissary, with a crestfallen air, “i really\\ncannot imagine how i came to overlook this.”\\n\\npoirot laughed.\\n\\n“the moral of that is, always look under the mats! my friend hastings\\nhere will tell you that anything in the least crooked is a torment to\\nme. as soon as i saw that the hearth-rug was out of the straight, i\\nsaid to myself: ‘_tiens!___ the leg of the chair caught it in being\\npushed back. possibly there may be something beneath it which the good\\nfrançoise overlooked.’\\u200a”\\n\\n“françoise?”\\n\\n“or denise, or léonie. whoever did this room. since there is no dust,\\nthe room _must___ have been done this morning. i reconstruct the\\nincident like this. yesterday, possibly last night, m. renauld drew a\\ncheque to the order of some one named duveen. afterwards it was torn\\nup, and scattered on the floor. this morning—” but m. bex was already\\npulling impatiently at the bell.\\n\\nfrançoise answered it. yes, there had been a lot of pieces of paper on\\nthe floor. what had she done with them? put them in the kitchen stove\\nof course! what else?\\n\\nwith a gesture of despair, bex dismissed her. then, his face\\nlightening, he ran to the desk. in a minute he was hunting through the\\ndead man’s cheque book. then he repeated his former gesture. the last\\ncounterfoil was blank.\\n\\n“courage!” cried poirot, clapping him on the back. “without doubt,\\nmadame renauld will be able to tell us all about this mysterious person\\nnamed duveen.”\\n\\nthe commissary’s face cleared. “that is true. let us proceed.”\\n\\nas we turned to leave the room, poirot remarked casually: “it was here\\nthat m. renauld received his guest last night, eh?”\\n\\n“it was—but how did you know?”\\n\\n“by _this___. i found it on the back of the leather chair.”\\n\\nand he held up between his finger and thumb a long black hair—a woman’s\\nhair!\\n\\nm. bex took us out by the back of the house to where there was a small\\nshed leaning against the house. he produced a key from his pocket and\\nunlocked it.\\n\\n“the body is here. we moved it from the scene of the crime just before\\nyou arrived, as the photographers had done with it.”\\n\\nhe opened the door and we passed in. the murdered man lay on the\\nground, with a sheet over him. m. bex dexterously whipped off the\\ncovering. renauld was a man of medium height, slender and lithe in\\nfigure. he looked about fifty years of age, and his dark hair was\\nplentifully streaked with grey. he was clean shaven with a long thin\\nnose, and eyes set rather close together, and his skin was deeply\\nbronzed, as that of a man who had spent most of his life beneath\\ntropical skies. his lips were drawn back from his teeth and an\\nexpression of absolute amazement and terror was stamped on the livid\\nfeatures.\\n\\n“one can see by his face that he was stabbed in the back,” remarked\\npoirot.\\n\\nvery gently, he turned the dead man over. there, between the\\nshoulder-blades, staining the light fawn overcoat, was a round dark\\npatch. in the middle of it there was a slit in the cloth. poirot\\nexamined it narrowly.\\n\\n“have you any idea with what weapon the crime was committed?”\\n\\n“it was left in the wound.” the commissary reached down a large glass\\njar. in it was a small object that looked to me more like a paper-knife\\nthan anything else. it had a black handle, and a narrow shining blade.\\nthe whole thing was not more than ten inches long. poirot tested the\\ndiscoloured point gingerly with his finger tip.\\n\\n“_ma foi!___ but it is sharp! a nice easy little tool for murder!”\\n\\n“unfortunately, we could find no trace of fingerprints on it,” remarked\\nbex regretfully. “the murderer must have worn gloves.”\\n\\n“of course he did,” said poirot contemptuously. “even in santiago they\\nknow enough for that. the veriest amateur of an english mees knows\\nit—thanks to the publicity the bertillon system has been given in the\\npress. all the same, it interests me very much that there were no\\nfinger-prints. it is so amazingly simple to leave the finger-prints of\\nsome one else! and then the police are happy.” he shook his head. “i\\nvery much fear our criminal is not a man of method—either that or he\\nwas pressed for time. but we shall see.”\\n\\nhe let the body fall back into its original position.\\n\\n“he wore only underclothes under his overcoat, i see,” he remarked.\\n\\n“yes, the examining magistrate thinks that is rather a curious point.”\\n\\nat this minute there was a tap on the door which bex had closed after\\nhim. he strode forward and opened it. françoise was there. she\\nendeavoured to peep in with ghoulish curiosity.\\n\\n“well, what is it?” demanded bex impatiently.\\n\\n“madame. she sends a message that she is much recovered, and is quite\\nready to receive the examining magistrate.”\\n\\n“good,” said m. bex briskly. “tell m. hautet and say that we will come\\nat once.”\\n\\npoirot lingered a moment, looking back towards the body. i thought for\\na moment that he was going to apostrophize it, to declare aloud his\\ndetermination never to rest till he had discovered the murderer. but\\nwhen he spoke, it was tamely and awkwardly, and his comment was\\nludicrously inappropriate to the solemnity of the moment.\\n\\n“he wore his overcoat very long,” he said constrainedly.\\n\\n\\n\\n5 mrs. renauld’s story\\n\\nwe found m. hautet awaiting us in the hall, and we all proceeded\\nupstairs together, françoise marching ahead to show us the way. poirot\\nwent up in a zigzag fashion which puzzled me, until he whispered with a\\ngrimace:\\n\\n“no wonder the servants heard m. renauld mounting the stairs; not a\\nboard of them but creaks fit to wake the dead!”\\n\\nat the head of the staircase, a small passage branched off.\\n\\n“the servants’ quarters,” explained bex.\\n\\nwe continued along a corridor, and françoise tapped on the last door to\\nthe right of it.\\n\\na faint voice bade us enter, and we passed into a large sunny apartment\\nlooking out towards the sea, which showed blue and sparkling about a\\nquarter of a mile distant.\\n\\non a couch, propped up with cushions, and attended by dr. durand, lay a\\ntall, striking-looking woman. she was middle-aged, and her once dark\\nhair was now almost entirely silvered, but the intense vitality and\\nstrength of her personality would have made itself felt anywhere. you\\nknew at once that you were in the presence of what the french call\\n“_une maitresse femme___.”\\n\\nshe greeted us with a dignified inclination of the head.\\n\\n“pray be seated, monsieurs.”\\n\\nwe took chairs, and the magistrate’s clerk established himself at a\\nround table.\\n\\n“i hope, madame,” began m. hautet, “that it will not distress you\\nunduly to relate to us what occurred last night?”\\n\\n“not at all, monsieur. i know the value of time, if these scoundrelly\\nassassins are to be caught and punished.”\\n\\n“very well, madame. it will fatigue you less, i think, if i ask you\\nquestions and you confine yourself to answering them. at what time did\\nyou go to bed last night?”\\n\\n“at half-past nine, monsieur. i was tired.”\\n\\n“and your husband?”\\n\\n“about an hour later, i fancy.”\\n\\n“did he seem disturbed—upset in any way?”\\n\\n“no, not more than usual.”\\n\\n“what happened then?”\\n\\n“we slept. i was awakened by a hand being pressed over my mouth. i\\ntried to scream out, but the hand prevented me. there were two men in\\nthe room. they were both masked.”\\n\\n“can you describe them at all, madame?”\\n\\n“one was very tall, and had a long black beard, the other was short and\\nstout. his beard was reddish. they both wore hats pulled down over\\ntheir eyes.”\\n\\n“h’m,” said the magistrate thoughtfully, “too much beard, i fear.”\\n\\n“you mean they were false?”\\n\\n“yes, madame. but continue your story.”\\n\\n“it was the short man who was holding me. he forced a gag into my\\nmouth, and then bound me with rope hand and foot. the other man was\\nstanding over my husband. he had caught up my little dagger paper-knife\\nfrom the dressing-table and was holding it with the point just over his\\nheart. when the short man had finished with me, he joined the other,\\nand they forced my husband to get up and accompany them into the\\ndressing-room next door. i was nearly fainting with terror,\\nnevertheless i listened desperately.\\n\\n“they were speaking in too low a tone for me to hear what they said.\\nbut i recognized the language, a bastard spanish such as is spoken in\\nsome parts of south america. they seemed to be demanding something from\\nmy husband, and presently they grew angry, and their voices rose a\\nlittle. i think the tall man was speaking. ‘you know what we want!’ he\\nsaid. ‘_the secret!___ where is it?’ i do not know what my husband\\nanswered, but the other replied fiercely: ‘you lie! we know you have\\nit. where are your keys?’\\n\\n“then i heard sounds of drawers being pulled out. there is a safe on\\nthe wall of my husband’s dressing-room in which he always keeps a\\nfairly large amount of ready money. léonie tells me this has been\\nrifled and the money taken, but evidently what they were looking for\\nwas not there, for presently i heard the tall man, with an oath,\\ncommand my husband to dress himself. soon after that, i think some\\nnoise in the house must have disturbed them, for they hustled my\\nhusband out into my room only half dressed.”\\n\\n“_pardon___,” interrupted poirot, “but is there then no other egress\\nfrom the dressing-room?”\\n\\n“no, monsieur, there is only the communicating door into my room. they\\nhurried my husband through, the short man in front, and the tall man\\nbehind him with the dagger still in his hand. paul tried to break away\\nto come to me. i saw his agonized eyes. he turned to his captors. ‘i\\nmust speak to her,’ he said. then, coming to the side of the bed, ‘it\\nis all right, eloise,’ he said. ‘do not be afraid. i shall return\\nbefore morning.’ but, although he tried to make his voice confident, i\\ncould see the terror in his eyes. then they hustled him out of the\\ndoor, the tall man saying: ‘one sound—and you are a dead man,\\nremember.’\\n\\n“after that,” continued mrs. renauld, “i must have fainted. the next\\nthing i recollect is léonie rubbing my wrists, and giving me brandy.”\\n\\n“madame renauld,” said the magistrate, “had you any idea what it was\\nfor which the assassins were searching?”\\n\\n“none whatever, monsieur.”\\n\\n“had you any knowledge that your husband feared something?”\\n\\n“yes. i had seen the change in him.”\\n\\n“how long ago was that?”\\n\\nmrs. renauld reflected.\\n\\n“ten days perhaps.”\\n\\n“not longer?”\\n\\n“possibly. i only noticed it then.”\\n\\n“did you question your husband at all as to the cause?”\\n\\n“once. he put me off evasively. nevertheless, i was convinced that he\\nwas suffering some terrible anxiety. however, since he evidently wished\\nto conceal the fact from me, i tried to pretend that i had noticed\\nnothing.”\\n\\n“were you aware that he had called in the services of a detective?”\\n\\n“a detective?” exclaimed mrs. renauld, very much surprised.\\n\\n“yes, this gentleman—m. hercule poirot.” poirot bowed. “he arrived\\ntoday in response to a summons from your husband.” and taking the\\nletter written by m. renauld from his pocket he handed it to the lady.\\n\\nshe read it with apparently genuine astonishment.\\n\\n“i had no idea of this. evidently he was fully cognizant of the\\ndanger.”\\n\\n“now, madame, i will beg of you to be frank with me. is there any\\nincident in your husband’s past life in south america which might throw\\nlight on his murder?”\\n\\nmrs. renauld reflected deeply, but at last shook her head.\\n\\n“i can think of none. certainly my husband had many enemies, people he\\nhad got the better of in some way or another, but i can think of no one\\ndistinctive case. i do not say there is no such incident—only that i am\\nnot aware of it.”\\n\\nthe examining magistrate stroked his beard disconsolately.\\n\\n“and you can fix the time of this outrage?”\\n\\n“yes, i distinctly remember hearing the clock on the mantelpiece strike\\ntwo.” she nodded towards an eight-day travelling clock in a leather\\ncase which stood in the centre of the chimney-piece.\\n\\npoirot rose from his seat, scrutinized the clock carefully, and nodded,\\nsatisfied.\\n\\n“and here too,” exclaimed m. bex, “is a wrist watch, knocked off the\\ndressing-table by the assassins, without doubt, and smashed to atoms.\\nlittle did they know it would testify against them.”\\n\\ngently he picked away the fragments of broken glass. suddenly his face\\nchanged to one of utter stupefaction.\\n\\n“_mon dieu!___” he ejaculated.\\n\\n“what is it?”\\n\\n“the hands of the watch point to seven o’clock!”\\n\\n“what?” cried the examining magistrate, astonished.\\n\\nbut poirot, deft as ever, took the broken trinket from the startled\\ncommissary, and held it to his ear. then he smiled.\\n\\n“the glass is broken, yes, but the watch itself is still going.”\\n\\nthe explanation of the mystery was greeted with a relieved smile. but\\nthe magistrate bethought him of another point.\\n\\n“but surely it is not seven o’clock now?”\\n\\n“no,” said poirot gently, “it is a few minutes after five. possibly the\\nwatch gains, is that so, madame?”\\n\\nmrs. renauld was frowning perplexedly.\\n\\n“it does gain,” she admitted, “but i’ve never known it to gain quite so\\nmuch as that.”\\n\\nwith a gesture of impatience, the magistrate left the matter of the\\nwatch and proceeded with his interrogatory.\\n\\n“madame, the front door was found ajar. it seems almost certain that\\nthe murderers entered that way, yet it has not been forced at all. can\\nyou suggest any explanation?”\\n\\n“possibly my husband went out for a stroll the last thing, and forgot\\nto latch it when he came in.”\\n\\n“is that a likely thing to happen?”\\n\\n“very. my husband was the most absent-minded of men.”\\n\\nthere was a slight frown on her brow as she spoke, as though this trait\\nin the dead man’s character had at times vexed her.\\n\\n“there is one inference i think we might draw,” remarked the commissary\\nsuddenly. “since the men insisted on m. renauld dressing himself, it\\nlooks as though the place they were taking him to, the place where ‘the\\nsecret’ was concealed, lay some distance away.”\\n\\nthe magistrate nodded.\\n\\n“yes, far, and yet not too far, since he spoke of being back by\\nmorning.”\\n\\n“what times does the last train leave the station of merlinville?”\\nasked poirot.\\n\\n“eleven-fifty one way, and 12:17 the other, but it is more probable\\nthat they had a motor waiting.”\\n\\n“of course,” agreed poirot, looking somewhat crestfallen.\\n\\n“indeed, that might be one way of tracing them,” continued the\\nmagistrate, brightening. “a motor containing two foreigners is quite\\nlikely to have been noticed. that is an excellent point, m. bex.”\\n\\nhe smiled to himself, and then, becoming grave once more, he said to\\nmrs. renauld:\\n\\n“there is another question. do you know any one of the name of\\n‘duveen’?”\\n\\n“duveen?” mrs. renauld repeated, thoughtfully. “no, for the moment, i\\ncannot say i do.”\\n\\n“you have never heard your husband mention any one of that name?”\\n\\n“never.”\\n\\n“do you know any one whose christian name is bella?”\\n\\nhe watched mrs. renauld narrowly as he spoke, seeking to surprise any\\nsigns of anger or consciousness, but she merely shook her head in quite\\na natural manner. he continued his questions.\\n\\n“are you aware that your husband had a visitor last night?”\\n\\nnow he saw the red mount slightly in her cheeks, but she replied\\ncomposedly.\\n\\n“no, who was that?”\\n\\n“a lady.”\\n\\n“indeed?”\\n\\nbut for the moment the magistrate was content to say no more. it seemed\\nunlikely that madame daubreuil had any connection with the crime, and\\nhe was anxious not to upset mrs. renauld more than necessary.\\n\\nhe made a sign to the commissary, and the latter replied with a nod.\\nthen rising, he went across the room, and returned with the glass jar\\nwe had seen in the outhouse in his hand. from this, he took the dagger.\\n\\n“madame,” he said gently, “do you recognize this?”\\n\\nshe gave a little cry.\\n\\n“yes, that is my little dagger.” then—she saw the stained point, and\\nshe drew back, her eyes widening with horror. “is that—blood?”\\n\\n“yes, madame. your husband was killed with this weapon.” he removed it\\nhastily from sight. “you are quite sure about it’s being the one that\\nwas on your dressing-table last night?”\\n\\n“oh, yes. it was a present from my son. he was in the air force during\\nthe war. he gave his age as older than it was.” there was a touch of\\nthe proud mother in her voice. “this was made from a streamline\\naeroplane wire, and was given to me by my son as a souvenir of the\\nwar.”\\n\\n“i see, madame. that brings us to another matter. your son, where is he\\nnow? it is necessary that he should be telegraphed to without delay.”\\n\\n“jack? he is on his way to buenos ayres.”\\n\\n“what?”\\n\\n“yes. my husband telegraphed to him yesterday. he had sent him on\\nbusiness to paris, but yesterday he discovered that it would be\\nnecessary for him to proceed without delay to south america. there was\\na boat leaving cherbourg for buenos ayres last night, and he wired him\\nto catch it.”\\n\\n“have you any knowledge of what the business in buenos ayres was?”\\n\\n“no, monsieur, i know nothing of its nature, but buenos ayres is not my\\nson’s final destination. he was going overland from there to santiago.”\\n\\nand, in unison, the magistrate and the commissary exclaimed:\\n\\n“santiago! again santiago!”\\n\\nit was at this moment, when we were all stunned by the mention of that\\nword, that poirot approached mrs. renauld. he had been standing by the\\nwindow like a man lost in a dream, and i doubt if he had fully taken in\\nwhat had passed. he paused by the lady’s side with a bow.\\n\\n“_pardon___, madame, but may i examine your wrists.”\\n\\nthough slightly surprised at the request, mrs. renauld held them out to\\nhim. round each of them was a cruel red mark where the cords had bitten\\ninto the flesh. as he examined them, i fancied that a momentary flicker\\nof excitement i had seen in his eyes disappeared.\\n\\n“they must cause you great pain,” he said, and once more he looked\\npuzzled.\\n\\nbut the magistrate was speaking excitedly.\\n\\n“young m. renauld must be communicated with at once by wireless. it is\\nvital that we should know anything he can tell us about this trip to\\nsantiago.” he hesitated. “i hoped he might have been near at hand, so\\nthat we could have saved you pain, madame.” he paused.\\n\\n“you mean,” she said in a low voice, “the identification of my\\nhusband’s body?”\\n\\nthe magistrate bowed his head.\\n\\n“i am a strong woman, monsieur. i can bear all that is required of me.\\ni am ready—now.”\\n\\n“oh, tomorrow will be quite soon enough, i assure you—”\\n\\n“i prefer to get it over,” she said in a low tone, a spasm of pain\\ncrossing her face. “if you will be so good as to give me your arm,\\ndoctor?”\\n\\nthe doctor hastened forward, a cloak was thrown over mrs. renauld’s\\nshoulders, and a slow procession went down the stairs. m. bex hurried\\non ahead to open the door of the shed. in a minute or two mrs. renauld\\nappeared in the doorway. she was very pale, but resolute. behind her,\\nm. hautet was clacking commiserations and apologies like an animated\\nhen.\\n\\nshe raised her hand to her face.\\n\\n“a moment, messieurs, while i steel myself.”\\n\\nshe took her hand away and looked down at the dead man. then the\\nmarvellous self-control which had upheld her so far deserted her.\\n\\n“paul!” she cried. “husband! oh, god!” and pitching forward she fell\\nunconscious to the ground.\\n\\ninstantly poirot was beside her, he raised the lid of her eye, felt her\\npulse. when he had satisfied himself that she had really fainted, he\\ndrew aside. he caught me by the arm.\\n\\n“i am an imbecile, my friend! if ever there was love and grief in a\\nwoman’s voice, i heard it then. my little idea was all wrong. _eh\\nbien!___ i must start again!”\\n\\n\\n\\n6 the scene of the crime\\n\\nbetween them, the doctor and m. hautet carried the unconscious woman\\ninto the house. the commissary looked after them, shaking his head.\\n\\n“_pauvre femme___,” he murmured to himself. “the shock was too much for\\nher. well, well, we can do nothing. now, m. poirot, shall we visit the\\nplace where the crime was committed?”\\n\\n“if you please, m. bex.”\\n\\nwe passed through the house, and out by the front door. poirot had\\nlooked up at the staircase in passing, and shook his head in a\\ndissatisfied manner.\\n\\n“it is to me incredible that the servants heard nothing. the creaking\\nof that staircase, with _three___ people descending it, would awaken\\nthe dead!”\\n\\n“it was the middle of the night, remember. they were sound asleep by\\nthen.”\\n\\nbut poirot continued to shake his head as though not fully accepting\\nthe explanation. on the sweep of the drive, he paused, looking up at\\nthe house.\\n\\n“what moved them in the first place to try if the front door were open?\\nit was a most unlikely thing that it should be. it was far more\\nprobable that they should at once try to force a window.”\\n\\n“but all the windows on the ground floor are barred with iron\\nshutters,” objected the commissary.\\n\\npoirot pointed to a window on the first floor.\\n\\n“that is the window of the bedroom we have just come from, is it not?\\nand see—there is a tree by which it would be the easiest thing in the\\nworld to mount.”\\n\\n“possibly,” admitted the other. “but they could not have done so\\nwithout leaving footprints in the flower-bed.”\\n\\ni saw the justice of his words. there were two large oval flower-beds\\nplanted with scarlet geraniums, one each side of the steps leading up\\nto the front door. the tree in question had its roots actually at the\\nback of the bed itself, and it would have been impossible to reach it\\nwithout stepping on the bed.\\n\\n“you see,” continued the commissary, “owing to the dry weather no\\nprints would show on the drive or paths; but, on the soft mould of the\\nflower-bed, it would have been a very different affair.”\\n\\npoirot went close to the bed and studied it attentively. as bex had\\nsaid, the mould was perfectly smooth. there was not an indentation on\\nit anywhere.\\n\\npoirot nodded, as though convinced, and we turned away, but he suddenly\\ndarted off and began examining the other flower-bed.\\n\\n“m. bex!” he called. “see here. here are plenty of traces for you.”\\n\\nthe commissary joined him—and smiled.\\n\\n“my dear m. poirot, those are without doubt the footprints of the\\ngardener’s large hobnailed boots. in any case, it would have no\\nimportance, since this side we have no tree, and consequently no means\\nof gaining access to the upper story.”\\n\\n“true,” said poirot, evidently crestfallen. “so you think these\\nfootprints are of no importance?”\\n\\n“not the least in the world.”\\n\\nthen, to my utter astonishment, poirot pronounced these words:\\n\\n“i do not agree with you. i have a little idea that these footprints\\nare the most important things we have seen yet.”\\n\\nm. bex said nothing, merely shrugged his shoulders. he was far too\\ncourteous to utter his real opinion.\\n\\n“shall we proceed?” he asked instead.\\n\\n“certainly. i can investigate this matter of the footprints later,”\\nsaid poirot cheerfully.\\n\\ninstead of following the drive down to the gate, m. bex turned up a\\npath that branched off at right angles. it led, up a slight incline,\\nround to the right of the house, and was bordered on either side by a\\nkind of shrubbery. suddenly it emerged into a little clearing from\\nwhich one obtained a view of the sea. a seat had been placed here, and\\nnot far from it was a rather ramshackle shed. a few steps further on, a\\nneat line of small bushes marked the boundary of the villa grounds. m.\\nbex pushed his way through these and we found ourselves on a wide\\nstretch of open downs. i looked round, and saw something that filled me\\nwith astonishment.\\n\\n“why, this is a golf course,” i cried.\\n\\nbex nodded.\\n\\n“the limits are not completed yet,” he explained. “it is hoped to be\\nable to open them sometime next month. it was some of the men working\\non them who discovered the body early this morning.”\\n\\ni gave a gasp. a little to my left, where for the moment i had\\noverlooked it, was a long narrow pit, and by it, face downwards, was\\nthe body of a man! for a moment, my heart gave a terrible leap, and i\\nhad a wild fancy that the tragedy had been duplicated. but the\\ncommissary dispelled my illusion by moving forward with a sharp\\nexclamation of annoyance:\\n\\n“what have my police been about? they had strict orders to allow no one\\nnear the place without proper credentials!”\\n\\nthe man on the ground turned his head over his shoulder.\\n\\n“but i have proper credentials,” he remarked, and rose slowly to his\\nfeet.\\n\\n“my dear m. giraud,” cried the commissary. “i had no idea that you had\\narrived, even. the examining magistrate has been awaiting you with the\\nutmost impatience.”\\n\\nas he spoke, i was scanning the new-comer with the keenest curiosity.\\nthe famous detective from the paris sûreté was familiar to me by name,\\nand i was extremely interested to see him in the flesh. he was very\\ntall, perhaps about thirty years of age, with auburn hair and\\nmoustache, and a military carriage. there was a trace of arrogance in\\nhis manner which showed that he was fully alive to his own importance.\\nbex introduced us, presenting poirot as a colleague. a flicker of\\ninterest came into the detective’s eye.\\n\\n“i know you by name, m. poirot,” he said. “you cut quite a figure in\\nthe old days, didn’t you? but methods are very different now.”\\n\\n“crimes, though, are very much the same,” remarked poirot gently.\\n\\ni saw at once that giraud was prepared to be hostile. he resented the\\nother being associated with him, and i felt that if he came across any\\nclue of importance he would be more than likely to keep it to himself.\\n\\n“the examining magistrate—” began bex again. but giraud interrupted him\\nrudely:\\n\\n“a fig for the examining magistrate! the light is the important thing.\\nfor all practical purposes it will be gone in another half-hour or so.\\ni know all about the case, and the people at the house will do very\\nwell until tomorrow, but, if we’re going to find a clue to the\\nmurderers, here is the spot we shall find it. is it your police who\\nhave been trampling all over the place? i thought they knew better\\nnowadays.”\\n\\n“assuredly they do. the marks you complain of were made by the workmen\\nwho discovered the body.”\\n\\nthe other grunted disgustedly.\\n\\n“i can see the tracks where the three of them came through the\\nhedge—but they were cunning. you can just recognize the centre\\nfootmarks as those of m. renauld, but those on either side have been\\ncarefully obliterated. not that there would really be much to see\\nanyway on this hard ground, but they weren’t taking any chances.”\\n\\n“the external sign,” said poirot. “that is what you seek, eh?”\\n\\nthe other detective stared.\\n\\n“of course.”\\n\\na very faint smile came to poirot’s lips. he seemed about to speak, but\\nchecked himself. he bent down to where a spade was lying.\\n\\n“that’s what the grave was dug with, right enough,” said giraud. “but\\nyou’ll get nothing from it. it was renauld’s own spade, and the man who\\nused it wore gloves. here they are.” he gesticulated with his foot to\\nwhere two soiled earth-stained gloves were lying. “and they’re\\nrenauld’s too—or at least his gardener’s. i tell you, the men who\\nplanned out this crime were taking no chances. the man was stabbed with\\nhis own dagger, and would have been buried with his own spade. they\\ncounted on leaving no traces! but i’ll beat them. there’s always\\n_something!___ and i mean to find it.”\\n\\nbut poirot was now apparently interested in something else, a short\\ndiscoloured piece of lead-piping which lay beside the spade. he touched\\nit delicately with his finger.\\n\\n“and does this, too, belong to the murdered man?” he asked, and i\\nthought i detected a subtle flavour of irony in the question.\\n\\ngiraud shrugged his shoulders to indicate that he neither knew nor\\ncared.\\n\\n“may have been lying around here for weeks. anyway, it doesn’t interest\\nme.”\\n\\n“i, on the contrary, find it very interesting,” said poirot sweetly.\\n\\ni guessed that he was merely bent on annoying the paris detective and,\\nif so, he succeeded. the other turned away rudely, remarking that he\\nhad no time to waste, and bending down he resumed his minute search of\\nthe ground.\\n\\nmeanwhile poirot, as though struck by a sudden idea, stepped back over\\nthe boundary, and tried the door of the little shed.\\n\\n“that’s locked,” said giraud over his shoulder. “but it’s only a place\\nwhere the gardener keeps his rubbish. the spade didn’t come from there,\\nbut from the toolshed up by the house.”\\n\\n“marvellous,” murmured m. bex, to me ecstatically. “he has been here\\nbut half an hour, and he already knows everything! what a man!\\nundoubtedly giraud is the greatest detective alive today.”\\n\\nalthough i disliked the detective heartily, i nevertheless was secretly\\nimpressed. efficiency seemed to radiate from the man. i could not help\\nfeeling that, so far, poirot had not greatly distinguished himself, and\\nit vexed me. he seemed to be directing his attention to all sorts of\\nsilly, puerile points that had nothing to do with the case. indeed, at\\nthis juncture, he suddenly asked:\\n\\n“m. bex, tell me, i pray you, the meaning of this whitewashed line that\\nextends all round the grave. is it a device of the police?”\\n\\n“no, m. poirot, it is an affair of the golf course. it shows that there\\nis here to be a ‘bunkair,’ as you call it.”\\n\\n“a bunkair?” poirot turned to me. “that is the irregular hole filled\\nwith sand and a bank at one side, is it not?”\\n\\ni concurred.\\n\\n“you do not play the golf, m. poirot?” inquired bex.\\n\\n“i? never! what a game!” he became excited. “figure to yourself, each\\nhole it is of a different length. the obstacles, they are not arranged\\nmathematically. even the greens are frequently up one side! there is\\nonly one pleasing thing—the how do you call them?—tee boxes! they, at\\nleast, are symmetrical.”\\n\\ni could not refrain from a laugh at the way the game appeared to\\npoirot, and my little friend smiled at me affectionately, bearing no\\nmalice. then he asked:\\n\\n“but m. renauld, without doubt he played the golf?”\\n\\n“yes, he was a keen golfer. it’s mainly owing to him, and to his large\\nsubscriptions, that this work is being carried forward. he even had a\\nsay in the designing of it.”\\n\\npoirot nodded thoughtfully.\\n\\nthen he remarked:\\n\\n“it was not a very good choice they made—of a spot to bury the body?\\nwhen the men began to dig up the ground, all would have been\\ndiscovered.”\\n\\n“exactly,” cried giraud triumphantly. “and that _proves___ that they\\nwere strangers to the place. it’s an excellent piece of indirect\\nevidence.”\\n\\n“yes,” said poirot doubtfully. “no one who knew would bury a body\\nthere—unless—unless—they _wanted___ it to be discovered. and that is\\nclearly absurd, is it not?”\\n\\ngiraud did not even trouble to reply.\\n\\n“yes,” said poirot, in a somewhat dissatisfied voice.\\n“yes—undoubtedly—absurd!”\\n\\n\\n\\n7 the mysterious madame daubreuil\\n\\nas we retraced our steps to the house, m. bex excused himself for\\nleaving us, explaining that he must immediately acquaint the examining\\nmagistrate with the fact of giraud’s arrival. giraud himself had been\\nobviously delighted when poirot declared that he had seen all he\\nwanted. the last thing we observed, as we left the spot, was giraud,\\ncrawling about on all fours, with a thoroughness in his search that i\\ncould not but admire. poirot guessed my thoughts, for as soon as we\\nwere alone he remarked ironically:\\n\\n“at last you have seen the detective you admire—the human foxhound! is\\nit not so, my friend?”\\n\\n“at any rate, he’s _doing___ something,” i said, with asperity. “if\\nthere’s anything to find, he’ll find it. now you—”\\n\\n“_eh bien!___ i also have found something! a piece of lead-piping.”\\n\\n“nonsense, poirot. you know very well that’s got nothing to do with it.\\ni meant _little___ things—traces that may lead us infallibly to the\\nmurderers.”\\n\\n“_mon ami___, a clue of two feet long is every bit as valuable as one\\nmeasuring two millimetres! but it is the romantic idea that all\\nimportant clues must be infinitesimal! as to the piece of lead-piping\\nhaving nothing to do with the crime, you say that because giraud told\\nyou so. no”—as i was about to interpose a question—“we will say no\\nmore. leave giraud to his search, and me to my ideas. the case seems\\nstraightforward enough—and yet—and yet, _mon ami___, i am not\\nsatisfied! and do you know why? because of the wrist watch that is two\\nhours fast. and then there are several curious little points that do\\nnot seem to fit in. for instance, if the object of the murderers was\\nrevenge, why did they not stab renauld in his sleep and have done with\\nit?”\\n\\n“they wanted the ‘secret,’\\u200a” i reminded him.\\n\\npoirot brushed a speck of dust from his sleeve with a dissatisfied air.\\n\\n“well, where is this ‘secret’? presumably some distance away, since\\nthey wish him to dress himself. yet he is found murdered close at hand,\\nalmost within ear-shot of the house. then again, it is pure chance that\\na weapon such as the dagger should be lying about casually, ready to\\nhand.”\\n\\nhe paused frowning, and then went on:\\n\\n“why did the servants hear nothing? were they drugged? was there an\\naccomplice and did that accomplice see to it that the front door should\\nremain open? i wonder if—”\\n\\nhe stopped abruptly. we had reached the drive in front of the house.\\nsuddenly he turned to me.\\n\\n“my friend, i am about to surprise you—to please you! i have taken your\\nreproaches to heart! we will examine some footprints!”\\n\\n“where?”\\n\\n“in that right-hand bed yonder. m. bex says that they are the footmarks\\nof the gardener. let us see if that is so. see, he approaches with his\\nwheelbarrow.”\\n\\nindeed an elderly man was just crossing the drive with a barrowful of\\nseedlings. poirot called to him, and he set down the barrow and came\\nhobbling towards us.\\n\\n“you are going to ask him for one of his boots to compare with the\\nfootmarks?” i asked breathlessly. my faith in poirot revived a little.\\nsince he said the footprints in this right-hand bed were important,\\npresumably they _were___.\\n\\n“exactly,” said poirot.\\n\\n“but won’t he think it very odd?”\\n\\n“he will not think about it at all.”\\n\\nwe could say no more, for the old man had joined us.\\n\\n“you want me for something, monsieur?”\\n\\n“yes. you have been gardener here a long time, haven’t you?”\\n\\n“twenty-four years, monsieur.”\\n\\n“and your name is—?”\\n\\n“auguste, monsieur.”\\n\\n“i was admiring these magnificent geraniums. they are truly superb.\\nthey have been planted long?”\\n\\n“some time, monsieur. but of course, to keep the beds looking smart,\\none must keep bedding out a few new plants, and remove those that are\\nover, besides keeping the old blooms well picked off.”\\n\\n“you put in some new plants yesterday, didn’t you? those in the middle\\nthere, and in the other bed also?”\\n\\n“monsieur has a sharp eye. it takes always a day or so for them to\\n‘pick up.’ yes, i put ten new plants in each bed last night. as\\nmonsieur doubtless knows, one should not put in plants when the sun is\\nhot.”\\n\\nauguste was charmed with poirot’s interest, and was quite inclined to\\nbe garrulous.\\n\\n“that is a splendid specimen there,” said poirot, pointing. “might i\\nperhaps have a cutting of it?”\\n\\n“but certainly, monsieur.” the old fellow stepped into the bed, and\\ncarefully took a slip from the plant poirot had admired.\\n\\npoirot was profuse in his thanks, and auguste departed to his barrow.\\n\\n“you see?” said poirot with a smile, as he bent over the bed to examine\\nthe indentation of the gardener’s hobnailed boot. “it is quite simple.”\\n\\n“i did not realize—”\\n\\n“that the foot would be inside the boot? you do not use your excellent\\nmental capacities sufficiently. well, what of the footmark?”\\n\\ni examined the bed carefully.\\n\\n“all the footmarks in the bed were made by the same boot,” i said at\\nlength after a careful study.\\n\\n“you think so? _eh bien___, i agree with you,” said poirot.\\n\\nhe seemed quite uninterested, and as though he were thinking of\\nsomething else.\\n\\n“at any rate,” i remarked, “you will have one bee less in your bonnet\\nnow.”\\n\\n“_mon dieu!___ but what an idiom! what does it mean?”\\n\\n“what i meant was that now you will give up your interest in these\\nfootmarks.”\\n\\nbut to my surprise poirot shook his head.\\n\\n“no, no, _mon ami___. at last i am on the right track. i am still in\\nthe dark, but, as i hinted just now to m. bex, these footmarks are the\\nmost important and interesting things in the case! that poor giraud—i\\nshould not be surprised if he took no notice of them whatever.”\\n\\nat that moment, the front door opened, and m. hautet and the commissary\\ncame down the steps.\\n\\n“ah, m. poirot, we were coming to look for you,” said the magistrate.\\n“it is getting late, but i wish to pay a visit to madame daubreuil.\\nwithout doubt she will be very much upset by m. renauld’s death, and we\\nmay be fortunate enough to get a clue from her. the secret that he did\\nnot confide to his wife, it is possible that he may have told it to the\\nwoman whose love held him enslaved. we know where our samsons are weak,\\ndon’t we?”\\n\\ni admired the picturesqueness of m. hautet’s language. i suspected that\\nthe examining magistrate was by now thoroughly enjoying his part in the\\nmysterious drama.\\n\\n“is m. giraud not going to accompany us?” asked poirot.\\n\\n“m. giraud has shown clearly that he prefers to conduct the case in his\\nown way,” said m. hautet dryly. one could see easily enough that\\ngiraud’s cavalier treatment of the examining magistrate had not\\nprejudiced the latter in his favour. we said no more, but fell into\\nline. poirot walked with the examining magistrate, and the commissary\\nand i followed a few paces behind.\\n\\n“there is no doubt that françoise’s story is substantially correct,” he\\nremarked to me in a confidential tone. “i have been telephoning\\nheadquarters. it seems that three times in the last six weeks—that is\\nto say since the arrival of m. renauld at merlinville—madame daubreuil\\nhas paid a large sum in notes into her banking account. altogether the\\nsum totals two hundred thousand francs!”\\n\\n“dear me,” i said, considering, “that must be something like four\\nthousand pounds!”\\n\\n“precisely. yes, there can be no doubt that he was absolutely\\ninfatuated. but it remains to be seen whether he confided his secret to\\nher. the examining magistrate is hopeful, but i hardly share his\\nviews.”\\n\\nduring this conversation we were walking down the lane towards the fork\\nin the road where our car had halted earlier in the afternoon, and in\\nanother moment i realized that the villa marguerite, the home of the\\nmysterious madame daubreuil, was the small house from which the\\nbeautiful girl had emerged.\\n\\n“she has lived here for many years,” said the commissary, nodding his\\nhead towards the house. “very quietly, very unobtrusively. she seems to\\nhave no friends or relations other than the acquaintances she has made\\nin merlinville. she never refers to the past, nor to her husband. one\\ndoes not even know if he is alive or dead. there is a mystery about\\nher, you comprehend.” i nodded, my interest growing.\\n\\n“and—the daughter?” i ventured.\\n\\n“a truly beautiful young girl—modest, devout, all that she should be.\\none pities her, for, though she may know nothing of the past, a man who\\nwants to ask her hand in marriage must necessarily inform himself, and\\nthen—” the commissary shrugged his shoulders cynically.\\n\\n“but it would not be her fault!” i cried, with rising indignation.\\n\\n“no. but what will you? a man is particular about his wife’s\\nantecedents.”\\n\\ni was prevented from further argument by our arrival at the door. m.\\nhautet rang the bell. a few minutes elapsed, and then we heard a\\nfootfall within, and the door was opened. on the threshold stood my\\nyoung goddess of that afternoon. when she saw us, the colour left her\\ncheeks, leaving her deathly white, and her eyes widened with\\napprehension. there was no doubt about it, she was afraid!\\n\\n“mademoiselle daubreuil,” said m. hautet, sweeping off his hat, “we\\nregret infinitely to disturb you, but the exigencies of the law—you\\ncomprehend? my compliments to madame your mother, and will she have the\\ngoodness to grant me a few moments’ interview.”\\n\\nfor a moment the girl stood motionless. her left hand was pressed to\\nher side, as though to still the sudden unconquerable agitation of her\\nheart. but she mastered herself, and said in a low voice:\\n\\n“i will go and see. please come inside.”\\n\\nshe entered a room on the left of the hall, and we heard the low murmur\\nof her voice. and then another voice, much the same in timbre, but with\\na slightly harder inflection behind its mellow roundness said:\\n\\n“but certainly. ask them to enter.”\\n\\nin another minute we were face to face with the mysterious madame\\ndaubreuil.\\n\\nshe was not nearly so tall as her daughter, and the rounded curves of\\nher figure had all the grace of full maturity. her hair, again unlike\\nher daughter’s, was dark, and parted in the middle in the madonna\\nstyle. her eyes, half hidden by the drooping lids, were blue. there was\\na dimple in the round chin, and the half parted lips seemed always to\\nhover on the verge of a mysterious smile. there was something almost\\nexaggeratedly feminine about her, at once yielding and seductive.\\nthough very well preserved, she was certainly no longer young, but her\\ncharm was of the quality which is independent of age.\\n\\nstanding there, in her black dress with the fresh white collar and\\ncuffs, her hands clasped together, she looked subtly appealing and\\nhelpless.\\n\\n“you wished to see me, monsieur?” she asked.\\n\\n“yes, madame.” m. hautet cleared his throat. “i am investigating the\\ndeath of m. renauld. you have heard of it, no doubt?”\\n\\nshe bowed her head without speaking. her expression did not change.\\n\\n“we came to ask you whether you can—er—throw any light upon the\\ncircumstances surrounding it?”\\n\\n“i?” the surprise of her tone was excellent.\\n\\n“yes, madame. it would, perhaps, be better if we could speak to you\\nalone.” he looked meaningly in the direction of the girl.\\n\\nmadame daubreuil turned to her.\\n\\n“marthe, dear—”\\n\\nbut the girl shook her head.\\n\\n“no, _maman___, i will not go. i am not a child. i am twenty-two. i\\nshall not go.”\\n\\nmadame daubreuil turned back to the examining magistrate.\\n\\n“you see, monsieur.”\\n\\n“i should prefer not to speak before mademoiselle daubreuil.”\\n\\n“as my daughter says, she is not a child.”\\n\\nfor a moment the magistrate hesitated, baffled.\\n\\n“very well, madame,” he said at last. “have it your own way. we have\\nreason to believe that you were in the habit of visiting the dead man\\nat his villa in the evenings. is that so?”\\n\\nthe colour rose in the lady’s pale cheeks, but she replied quietly:\\n\\n“i deny your right to ask me such a question!”\\n\\n“madame, we are investigating a murder.”\\n\\n“well, what of it? i had nothing to do with the murder.”\\n\\n“madame, we do not say that for a moment. but you knew the dead man\\nwell. did he ever confide in you as to any danger that threatened him?”\\n\\n“never.”\\n\\n“did he ever mention his life in santiago, and any enemies he may have\\nmade there?”\\n\\n“no.”\\n\\n“then you can give us no help at all?”\\n\\n“i fear not. i really do not see why you should come to me. cannot his\\nwife tell you what you want to know?” her voice held a slender\\ninflection of irony.\\n\\n“madame renauld has told us all she can.”\\n\\n“ah!” said madame daubreuil. “i wonder—”\\n\\n“you wonder what, madame?”\\n\\n“nothing.”\\n\\nthe examining magistrate looked at her. he was aware that he was\\nfighting a duel, and that he had no mean antagonist.\\n\\n“you persist in your statement that m. renauld confided nothing in\\nyou?”\\n\\n“why should you think it likely that he should confide in me?”\\n\\n“because, madame,” said m. hautet, with calculated brutality. “a man\\ntells to his mistress what he does not always tell to his wife.”\\n\\n“ah!” she sprang forward. her eyes flashed fire. “monsieur, you insult\\nme! and before my daughter! i can tell you nothing. have the goodness\\nto leave my house!”\\n\\nthe honours undoubtedly rested with the lady. we left the villa\\nmarguerite like a shamefaced pack of schoolboys. the magistrate\\nmuttered angry ejaculations to himself. poirot seemed lost in thought.\\nsuddenly he came out of his reverie with a start, and inquired of m.\\nhautet if there was a good hotel near at hand.\\n\\n“there is a small place, the hotel des bains, on this side of town. a\\nfew hundred yards down the road. it will be handy for your\\ninvestigations. we shall see you in the morning then, i presume?”\\n\\n“yes, i thank you, m. hautet.”\\n\\nwith mutual civilities, we parted company, poirot and i going towards\\nmerlinville, and the others returning to the villa geneviève.\\n\\n“the french police system is very marvellous,” said poirot, looking\\nafter them. “the information they possess about every one’s life, down\\nto the most commonplace detail, is extraordinary. though he has only\\nbeen here a little over six weeks, they are perfectly well acquainted\\nwith m. renauld’s tastes and pursuits, and at a moment’s notice they\\ncan produce information as to madame daubreuil’s banking account, and\\nthe sums that have lately been paid in! undoubtedly the _dossier___ is\\na great institution. but what is that?” he turned sharply.\\n\\na figure was running hatless, down the road after us. it was marthe\\ndaubreuil.\\n\\n“i beg your pardon,” she cried breathlessly, as she reached us. “i—i\\nshould not do this, i know. you must not tell my mother. but is it\\ntrue, what the people say, that m. renauld called in a detective before\\nhe died, and—and that you are he?”\\n\\n“yes, mademoiselle,” said poirot gently. “it is quite true. but how did\\nyou learn it?”\\n\\n“françoise told our amélie,” explained marthe, with a blush.\\n\\npoirot made a grimace.\\n\\n“the secrecy, it is impossible in an affair of this kind! not that it\\nmatters. well, mademoiselle, what is it you want to know?”\\n\\nthe girl hesitated. she seemed longing, yet fearing, to speak. at last,\\nalmost in a whisper, she asked:\\n\\n“is—any one suspected?”\\n\\npoirot eyed her keenly.\\n\\nthen he replied evasively:\\n\\n“suspicion is in the air at present, mademoiselle.”\\n\\n“yes, i know—but—any one in particular?”\\n\\n“why do you want to know?”\\n\\nthe girl seemed frightened by the question. all at once poirot’s words\\nabout her earlier in the day recurred to me. the “girl with the anxious\\neyes!”\\n\\n“m. renauld was always very kind to me,” she replied at last. “it is\\nnatural that i should be interested.”\\n\\n“i see,” said poirot. “well, mademoiselle, suspicion at present is\\nhovering round two persons.”\\n\\n“two?”\\n\\ni could have sworn there was a note of surprise and relief in her\\nvoice.\\n\\n“their names are unknown, but they are presumed to be chilians from\\nsantiago. and now, mademoiselle, you see what comes of being young and\\nbeautiful! i have betrayed professional secrets for you!”\\n\\nthe girl laughed merrily, and then, rather shyly, she thanked him.\\n\\n“i must run back now. _maman___ will miss me.”\\n\\nand she turned and ran back up the road, looking like a modern\\natalanta. i stared after her.\\n\\n“_mon ami___,” said poirot, in his gentle ironical voice, “is it that\\nwe are to remain planted here all night—just because you have seen a\\nbeautiful young woman, and your head is in a whirl?”\\n\\ni laughed and apologized.\\n\\n“but she _is___ beautiful, poirot. any one might be excused for being\\nbowled over by her.”\\n\\npoirot groaned.\\n\\n“_mon dieu!___ but it is that you have the susceptible heart!”\\n\\n“poirot,” i said, “do you remember after the styles case when—”\\n\\n“when you were in love with two charming women at once, and neither of\\nthem were for you? yes, i remember.”\\n\\n“you consoled me by saying that perhaps some day we should hunt\\ntogether again, and that then—”\\n\\n“_eh bien?___”\\n\\n“well, we are hunting together again, and—” i paused, and laughed\\nrather self-consciously.\\n\\nbut to my surprise poirot shook his head very earnestly.\\n\\n“ah, _mon ami___, do not set your heart on marthe daubreuil. she is not\\nfor you, that one! take it from papa poirot!”\\n\\n“why,” i cried, “the commissary assured me that she was as good as she\\nis beautiful! a perfect angel!”\\n\\n“some of the greatest criminals i have known had the faces of angels,”\\nremarked poirot cheerfully. “a malformation of the grey cells may\\ncoincide quite easily with the face of a madonna.”\\n\\n“poirot,” i cried, horrified, “you cannot mean that you suspect an\\ninnocent child like this!”\\n\\n“ta-ta-ta! do not excite yourself! i have not said that i suspected\\nher. but you must admit that her anxiety to know about the case is\\nsomewhat unusual.”\\n\\n“for once, i see further than you do,” i said. “her anxiety is not for\\nherself—but for her mother.”\\n\\n“my friend,” said poirot, “as usual, you see nothing at all. madame\\ndaubreuil is very well able to look after herself without her daughter\\nworrying about her. i admit i was teasing you just now, but all the\\nsame i repeat what i said before. do not set your heart on that girl.\\nshe is not for you! i, hercule poirot, know it. _sacré!___ if only i\\ncould remember where i had seen that face!”\\n\\n“what face?” i asked, surprised. “the daughter’s?”\\n\\n“no. the mother’s.”\\n\\nnoting my surprise, he nodded emphatically.\\n\\n“but yes—it is as i tell you. it was a long time ago, when i was still\\nwith the police in belgium. i have never actually seen the woman\\nbefore, but i have seen her picture—and in connection with some case. i\\nrather fancy—”\\n\\n“yes?”\\n\\n“i may be mistaken, but i rather fancy that it was a murder case!”\\n\\n\\n\\n8 an unexpected meeting\\n\\nwe were up at the villa betimes next morning. the man on guard at the\\ngate did not bar our way this time. instead, he respectfully saluted\\nus, and we passed on to the house. the maid léonie was just coming down\\nthe stairs, and seemed not averse to the prospect of a little\\nconversation.\\n\\npoirot inquired after the health of mrs. renauld.\\n\\nléonie shook her head.\\n\\n“she is terribly upset, _la pauvre dame!___ she will eat nothing—but\\nnothing! and she is as pale as a ghost. it is heartrending to see her.\\nah, _par exemple___, it is not i who would grieve like that for a man\\nwho had deceived me with another woman!”\\n\\npoirot nodded sympathetically.\\n\\n“what you say is very just, but what will you? the heart of a woman who\\nloves will forgive many blows. still, undoubtedly there must have been\\nmany scenes of recrimination between them in the last few months?”\\n\\nagain léonie shook her head.\\n\\n“never, monsieur. never have i heard madame utter a word of protest—of\\nreproach, even! she had the temper and disposition of an angel—quite\\ndifferent to monsieur.”\\n\\n“monsieur renauld had not the temper of an angel?”\\n\\n“far from it. when he enraged himself, the whole house knew of it. the\\nday that he quarrelled with m. jack—_ma foi!___ they might have been\\nheard in the market place, they shouted so loud!”\\n\\n“indeed,” said poirot. “and when did this quarrel take place?”\\n\\n“oh! it was just before m. jack went to paris. almost he missed his\\ntrain. he came out of the library, and caught up his bag which he had\\nleft in the hall. the automobile, it was being repaired, and he had to\\nrun for the station. i was dusting the salon, and i saw him pass, and\\nhis face was white—white—with two burning spots of red. ah, but he was\\nangry!”\\n\\nléonie was enjoying her narrative thoroughly.\\n\\n“and the dispute, what was it about?”\\n\\n“ah, that i do not know,” confessed léonie. “it is true that they\\nshouted, but their voices were so loud and high, and they spoke so\\nfast, that only one well acquainted with english could have\\ncomprehended. but monsieur, he was like a thundercloud all day!\\nimpossible to please him!”\\n\\nthe sound of a door shutting upstairs cut short léonie’s loquacity.\\n\\n“and françoise who awaits me!” she exclaimed, awakening to a tardy\\nremembrance of her duties. “that old one, she always scolds.”\\n\\n“one moment, mademoiselle. the examining magistrate, where is he?”\\n\\n“they have gone out to look at the automobile in the garage. monsieur\\nthe commissary had some idea that it might have been used on the night\\nof the murder.”\\n\\n“_quelle idée___,” murmured poirot, as the girl disappeared.\\n\\n“you will go out and join them?”\\n\\n“no, i shall await their return in the _salon___. it is cool there on\\nthis hot morning.”\\n\\nthis placid way of taking things did not quite commend itself to me.\\n\\n“if you don’t mind—” i said, and hesitated.\\n\\n“not in the least. you wish to investigate on your own account, eh?”\\n\\n“well, i’d rather like to have a look at giraud, if he’s anywhere\\nabout, and see what he’s up to.”\\n\\n“the human foxhound,” murmured poirot, as he leaned back in a\\ncomfortable chair, and closed his eyes. “by all means, my friend. au\\nrevoir.”\\n\\ni strolled out of the front door. it was certainly hot. i turned up the\\npath we had taken the day before. i had a mind to study the scene of\\nthe crime myself. i did not go directly to the spot, however, but\\nturned aside into the bushes, so as to come out on the links some\\nhundred yards or so further to the right. if giraud were still on the\\nspot, i wanted to observe his methods before he knew of my presence.\\nbut the shrubbery here was much denser, and i had quite a struggle to\\nforce my way through. when i emerged at last on the course, it was\\nquite unexpectedly and with such vigour that i cannoned heavily into a\\nyoung lady who had been standing with her back to the plantation.\\n\\nshe not unnaturally gave a suppressed shriek, but i, too, uttered an\\nexclamation of surprise. for it was my friend of the train, cinderella!\\n\\nthe surprise was mutual.\\n\\n“you,” we both exclaimed simultaneously.\\n\\nthe young lady recovered herself first.\\n\\n“my only aunt!” she exclaimed. “what are you doing here?”\\n\\n“for the matter of that, what are you?” i retorted.\\n\\n“when last i saw you, the day before yesterday, you were trotting home\\nto england like a good little boy. have they given you a season ticket\\nto and fro, on the strength of your m.p.?”\\n\\ni ignored the end of the speech.\\n\\n“when last i saw you,” i said, “you were trotting home with your\\nsister, like a good little girl. by the way, how is your sister?”\\n\\na flash of white teeth rewarded me.\\n\\n“how kind of you to ask! my sister is well, i thank you.”\\n\\n“she is here with you?”\\n\\n“she remained in town,” said the minx with dignity.\\n\\n“i don’t believe you’ve got a sister,” i laughed. “if you have, her\\nname is harris!”\\n\\n“do you remember mine?” she asked, with a smile.\\n\\n“cinderella. but you’re going to tell me the real one now, aren’t you?”\\n\\nshe shook her head with a wicked look.\\n\\n“not even why you’re here?”\\n\\n“oh, that! i suppose you’ve heard of members of my profession\\n‘resting.’\\u200a”\\n\\n“at expensive french watering-places?”\\n\\n“dirt cheap if you know where to go.”\\n\\ni eyed her keenly.\\n\\n“still, you’d no intention of coming here when i met you two days ago?”\\n\\n“we all have our disappointments,” said miss cinderella sententiously.\\n“there now, i’ve told you quite as much as is good for you. little boys\\nshould not be inquisitive. you’ve not yet told me what you’re doing\\nhere? got the m.p. in tow, i suppose, doing the gay boy on the beach.”\\n\\ni shook my head. “guess again. you remember my telling you that my\\ngreat friend was a detective?”\\n\\n“yes?”\\n\\n“and perhaps you’ve heard about this crime—at the villa geneviève—?”\\n\\nshe stared at me. her breast heaved, and her eyes grew wide and round.\\n\\n“you don’t mean—that you’re in on _that?___”\\n\\ni nodded. there was no doubt that i had scored heavily. her emotion, as\\nshe regarded me, was only too evident. for some few seconds, she\\nremained silent, staring at me. then she nodded her head emphatically.\\n\\n“well, if that doesn’t beat the band! tote me round. i want to see all\\nthe horrors.”\\n\\n“what do you mean?”\\n\\n“what i say. bless the boy, didn’t i tell you i doted on crimes? what\\ndo you think i’m imperilling my ankles for in high-heeled shoes over\\nthis stubble? i’ve been nosing round for hours. tried the front way in,\\nbut that old stick-in-the-mud of a french gendarme wasn’t taking any. i\\nguess helen of troy, and cleopatra, and mary, queen of scots, rolled in\\none wouldn’t cut ice with him! it’s a real piece of luck happening on\\nyou this way. come on, show me all the sights.”\\n\\n“but look here—wait a minute—i can’t. nobody’s allowed in. they’re\\nawfully strict.”\\n\\n“aren’t you and your friend the big bugs?”\\n\\ni was loath to relinquish my position of importance.\\n\\n“why are you so keen?” i asked weakly. “and what is it you want to\\nsee.”\\n\\n“oh, everything! the place where it happened, and the weapon, and the\\nbody, and any finger-prints or interesting things like that. i’ve never\\nhad a chance of being right in on a murder like this before. it’ll last\\nme all my life?”\\n\\ni turned away, sickened. what were women coming to nowadays? the girl’s\\nghoulish excitement nauseated me. i had read of the mobs of women who\\nbesieged the law courts when some wretched man was being tried for his\\nlife on the capital charge. i had sometimes wondered who these women\\nwere. now i knew. they were of the likeness of cinderella, young, yet\\nobsessed with a yearning for morbid excitement, for sensation at any\\nprice, without regard to any decency or good feeling. the vividness of\\nthe girl’s beauty had attracted me in spite of myself, yet at heart i\\nretained my first impression of disapproval and dislike. i thought of\\nmy mother, long since dead. what would she have said of this strange\\nmodern product of girlhood? the pretty face with the paint and powder,\\nand the ghoulish mind behind!\\n\\n“come off your high horse,” said the lady suddenly. “and don’t give\\nyourself airs. when you got called to this job, did you put your nose\\nin the air and say it was a nasty business, and you wouldn’t be mixed\\nup in it?”\\n\\n“no, but—”\\n\\n“if you’d been here on a holiday, wouldn’t you be nosing round just the\\nsame as i am? of course you would.”\\n\\n“i’m a man. you’re a woman.”\\n\\n“your idea of a woman is some one who gets on a chair and shrieks if\\nshe sees a mouse. that’s all prehistoric. but you _will___ show me\\nround, won’t you? you see, it might make a big difference to me.”\\n\\n“in what way?”\\n\\n“they’re keeping all the reporters out. i might make a big scoop with\\none of the papers. you don’t know how much they pay for a bit of inside\\nstuff.”\\n\\ni hesitated. she slipped a small soft hand into mine.\\n\\n“_please___—there’s a dear.”\\n\\ni capitulated. secretly, i knew that i should rather enjoy the part of\\nshowman. after all, the moral attitude displayed by the girl was none\\nof my business. i was a little nervous as to what the examining\\nmagistrate might say, but i reassured myself by the reflection that no\\nharm could possibly be done.\\n\\nwe repaired first to the spot where the body had been discovered. a man\\nwas on guard there, who saluted respectfully, knowing me by sight, and\\nraised no question as to my companion. presumably he regarded her as\\nvouched for by me. i explained to cinderella just how the discovery had\\nbeen made, and she listened attentively, sometimes putting an\\nintelligent question. then we turned our steps in the direction of the\\nvilla. i proceeded rather cautiously, for, truth to tell, i was not at\\nall anxious to meet any one. i took the girl through the shrubbery\\nround to the back of the house where the small shed was. i recollected\\nthat yesterday evening, after relocking the door, m. bex had left the\\nkey with the _sergent de ville___ marchaud, “in case m. giraud should\\nrequire it while we are upstairs.” i thought it quite likely that the\\nsûreté detective, after using it, had returned it to marchaud again.\\nleaving the girl out of sight in the shrubbery, i entered the house.\\nmarchaud was on duty outside the door of the _salon___. from within\\ncame the murmur of voices.\\n\\n“monsieur desires hautet? he is within. he is again interrogating\\nfrançoise.”\\n\\n“no,” i said hastily, “i don’t want him. but i should very much like\\nthe key of the shed outside if it is not against regulations.”\\n\\n“but certainly, monsieur.” he produced it. “here it is. m. le juge gave\\norders that all facilities were to be placed at your disposal. you will\\nreturn it to me when you have finished out there, that is all.”\\n\\n“of course.”\\n\\ni felt a thrill of satisfaction as i realized that in marchaud’s eyes,\\nat least, i ranked equally in importance with poirot. the girl was\\nwaiting for me. she gave an exclamation of delight as she saw the key\\nin my hand.\\n\\n“you’ve got it then?”\\n\\n“of course,” i said coolly. “all the same, you know, what i’m doing is\\nhighly irregular.”\\n\\n“you’ve been a perfect duck, and i shan’t forget it. come along. they\\ncan’t see us from the house, can they?”\\n\\n“wait a minute.” i arrested her eager advance. “i won’t stop you if you\\nreally wish to go in. but do you? you’ve seen the grave, and the\\ngrounds, and you’ve heard all the details of the affair. isn’t that\\nenough for you? this is going to be gruesome, you know,\\nand—unpleasant.”\\n\\nshe looked at me for a moment with an expression that i could not quite\\nfathom. then she laughed.\\n\\n“me for the horrors,” she said. “come along.”\\n\\nin silence we arrived at the door of the shed. i opened it and we\\npassed in. i walked over to the body, and gently pulled down the sheet\\nas m. bex had done the preceding afternoon. a little gasping sound\\nescaped from the girl’s lips, and i turned and looked at her. there was\\nhorror on her face now, and those debonair high spirits of hers were\\nquenched utterly. she had not chosen to listen to my advice, and she\\nwas punished now for her disregard of it. i felt singularly merciless\\ntowards her. she should go through with it now. i turned the corpse\\ngently over.\\n\\n“you see,” i said, “he was stabbed in the back.”\\n\\nher voice was almost soundless.\\n\\n“with what?”\\n\\ni nodded towards the glass jar.\\n\\n“that dagger.”\\n\\nsuddenly the girl reeled, and then sank down in a heap. i sprang to her\\nassistance.\\n\\n“you are faint. come out of here. it has been too much for you.”\\n\\n“water,” she murmured. “quick. water.\\u200a…”\\n\\ni left her, and rushed into the house. fortunately none of the servants\\nwere about, and i was able to secure a glass of water unobserved and\\nadd a few drops of brandy from a pocket flask. in a few minutes i was\\nback again. the girl was lying as i had left her, but a few sips of the\\nbrandy and water revived her in a marvellous manner.\\n\\n“take me out of here—oh, quickly, quickly!” she cried, shuddering.\\n\\nsupporting her with my arm i led her out into the air, and she pulled\\nthe door to behind her. then she drew a deep breath.\\n\\n“that’s better. oh, it was horrible! why did you ever let me go in?”\\n\\ni felt this to be so feminine that i could not forbear a smile.\\nsecretly, i was not dissatisfied with her collapse. it proved that she\\nwas not quite so callous as i had thought her. after all she was little\\nmore than a child, and her curiosity had probably been of the\\nunthinking order.\\n\\n“i did my best to stop you, you know,” i said gently.\\n\\n“i suppose you did. well, good-bye.”\\n\\n“look here, you can’t start off like that—all alone. you’re not fit for\\nit. i insist on accompanying you back to merlinville.”\\n\\n“nonsense. i’m quite all right now.”\\n\\n“supposing you felt faint again? no, i shall come with you.”\\n\\nbut this she combated with a good deal of energy. in the end, however,\\ni prevailed so far as to be allowed to accompany her to the outskirts\\nof the town. we retraced our steps over our former route, passing the\\ngrave again, and making a detour on to the road. where the first\\nstraggling line of shops began, she stopped and held out her hand.\\n\\n“good-bye, and thank you ever so much for coming with me.”\\n\\n“are you sure you’re all right now?”\\n\\n“quite, thanks. i hope you won’t get into any trouble over showing me\\nthings?”\\n\\ni disclaimed the idea lightly.\\n\\n“well, good-bye.”\\n\\n“au revoir,” i corrected. “if you’re staying here, we shall meet\\nagain.”\\n\\nshe flashed a smile at me.\\n\\n“that’s so. au revoir, then.”\\n\\n“wait a second, you haven’t told me your address?”\\n\\n“oh, i’m staying at the hôtel du phare. it’s a little place, but quite\\ngood. come and look me up tomorrow.”\\n\\n“i will,” i said, with perhaps rather unnecessary _empressement___.\\n\\ni watched her out of sight, then turned and retraced my steps to the\\nvilla. i remembered that i had not relocked the door of the shed.\\nfortunately no one had noticed the oversight, and turning the key i\\nremoved it and returned it to the _sergent de ville___. and, as i did\\nso, it came upon me suddenly that though cinderella had given me her\\naddress i still did not know her name.\\n\\n\\n\\n9 m. giraud finds some clues\\n\\nin the _salon___ i found the examining magistrate busily interrogating\\nthe old gardener auguste. poirot and the commissary, who were both\\npresent, greeted me respectively with a smile and a polite bow. i\\nslipped quietly into a seat. m. hautet was painstaking and meticulous\\nin the extreme, but did not succeed in eliciting anything of\\nimportance.\\n\\nthe gardening gloves auguste admitted to be his. he wore them when\\nhandling a certain species of primula plant which was poisonous to some\\npeople. he could not say when he had worn them last. certainly he had\\nnot missed them. where were they kept? sometimes in one place,\\nsometimes in another. the spade was usually to be found in the small\\ntool shed. was it locked? of course it was locked. where was the key\\nkept? _parbleu___, it was in the door of course! there was nothing of\\nvalue to steal. who would have expected a party of bandits, of\\nassassins? such things did not happen in madame la vicomtesse’s time.\\nm. hautet signifying that he had finished with him, the old man\\nwithdrew, grumbling to the last. remembering poirot’s unaccountable\\ninsistence on the footprints in the flower beds, i scrutinized him\\nnarrowly as he gave his evidence. either he had nothing to do with the\\ncrime or he was a consummate actor. suddenly, just as he was going out\\nof the door, an idea struck me. “_pardon___ m. hautet,” i cried, “but\\nwill you permit me to ask him one question?”\\n\\n“but certainly, monsieur.”\\n\\nthus encouraged, i turned to auguste.\\n\\n“where do you keep your boots?”\\n\\n“_sac à papier!___” growled the old man. “on my feet. where else?”\\n\\n“but when you go to bed at night?”\\n\\n“under my bed.”\\n\\n“but who cleans them?”\\n\\n“nobody. why should they be cleaned? is it that i promenade myself on\\nthe front like a young man? on sunday i wear the sunday boots, _bien\\nentendu___, but otherwise—!” he shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\ni shook my head, discouraged.\\n\\n“well, well,” said the magistrate. “we do not advance very much.\\nundoubtedly we are held up until we get the return cable from santiago.\\nhas any one seen giraud? in verity that one lacks politeness! i have a\\nvery good mind to send for him and—”\\n\\n“you will not have to send far, m. le juge.”\\n\\nthe quiet voice startled us. giraud was standing outside looking in\\nthrough the open window.\\n\\nhe leaped lightly into the room, and advanced to the table.\\n\\n“here i am, m. le juge, at your service. accept my excuses for not\\npresenting myself sooner.”\\n\\n“not at all. not at all,” said the magistrate, rather confused.\\n\\n“of course i am only a detective,” continued the other. “i know nothing\\nof interrogatories. were i conducting one, i should be inclined to do\\nso without an open window. any one standing outside can so easily hear\\nall that passes.\\u200a… but no matter.”\\n\\nm. hautet flushed angrily. there was evidently going to be no love lost\\nbetween the examining magistrate and the detective in charge of the\\ncase. they had fallen foul of each other at the start. perhaps in any\\nevent it would have been much the same. to giraud, all examining\\nmagistrates were fools, and to m. hautet who took himself seriously,\\nthe casual manner of the paris detective could not fail to give\\noffence.\\n\\n“_eh bien___, m. giraud,” said the magistrate rather sharply. “without\\ndoubt you have been employing your time to a marvel? you have the names\\nof the assassins for us, have you not? and also the precise spot where\\nthey find themselves now?”\\n\\nunmoved by this irony, giraud replied:\\n\\n“i know at least where they have come from.”\\n\\n“_comment?___”\\n\\ngiraud took two small objects from his pocket and laid them down on the\\ntable. we crowded round. the objects were very simple ones: the stub of\\na cigarette, and an unlighted match. the detective wheeled round on\\npoirot.\\n\\n“what do you see there?” he asked.\\n\\nthere was something almost brutal in his tone. it made my cheeks flush.\\nbut poirot remained unmoved. he shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n“a cigarette end, and a match.”\\n\\n“and what does that tell you?”\\n\\npoirot spread out his hands.\\n\\n“it tells me—nothing.”\\n\\n“ah!” said giraud, in a satisfied voice. “you haven’t made a study of\\nthese things. that’s not an ordinary match—not in this country at\\nleast. it’s common enough in south america. luckily it’s unlighted. i\\nmightn’t have recognized it otherwise. evidently one of the men threw\\naway his cigarette end, and lit another, spilling one match out of the\\nbox as he did so.”\\n\\n“and the other match?” asked poirot.\\n\\n“which match?”\\n\\n“the one he _did___ light his cigarette with. you have found that\\nalso?”\\n\\n“no.”\\n\\n“perhaps you didn’t search very thoroughly.”\\n\\n“not search thoroughly—” for a moment it seemed as though the detective\\nwere going to break out angrily, but with an effort he controlled\\nhimself. “i see you love a joke, m. poirot. but in any case, match or\\nno match, the cigarette end would be sufficient. it is a south american\\ncigarette with liquorice pectoral paper.”\\n\\npoirot bowed. the commissary spoke:\\n\\n“the cigarette end and match might have belonged to m. renauld.\\nremember, it is only two years since he returned from south america.”\\n\\n“no,” replied the other confidently. “i have already searched among the\\neffects of m. renauld. the cigarettes he smoked and the matches he used\\nare quite different.”\\n\\n“you do not think it odd,” asked poirot, “that these strangers should\\ncome unprovided with a weapon, with gloves, with a spade, and that they\\nshould so conveniently find all these things?”\\n\\ngiraud smiled in a rather superior manner.\\n\\n“undoubtedly it is strange. indeed, without the theory that i hold, it\\nwould be inexplicable.”\\n\\n“aha!” said m. hautet. “an accomplice. an accomplice within the house!”\\n\\n“or outside it,” said giraud with a peculiar smile.\\n\\n“but some one must have admitted them? we cannot allow that, by an\\nunparalleled piece of good fortune, they found the door ajar for them\\nto walk in?”\\n\\n“_d’accord___, m. le juge. the door was opened for them, but it could\\njust as easily be opened from outside—by some one who possessed a key.”\\n\\n“but who did possess a key?”\\n\\ngiraud shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n“as for that, no one who possesses one is going to admit the fact if\\nthey can help it. but several people _might___ have had one. m. jack\\nrenauld, the son, for instance. it is true that he is on his way to\\nsouth america, but he might have lost the key or had it stolen from\\nhim. then there is the gardener—he has been here many years. one of the\\nyounger servants may have a lover. it is easy to take an impression of\\na key and have one cut. there are many possibilities. then there is\\nanother person who, i should judge, is exceedingly likely to have such\\na thing in her keeping.”\\n\\n“who is that?”\\n\\n“madame daubreuil,” said the detective dryly.\\n\\n“eh, eh!” said the magistrate, his face falling a little, “so you have\\nheard about that, have you?”\\n\\n“i hear everything,” said giraud imperturbably.\\n\\n“there is one thing i could swear you have not heard,” said m. hautet,\\ndelighted to be able to show superior knowledge, and without more ado,\\nhe retailed the story of the mysterious visitor the night before. he\\nalso touched on the cheque made out to “duveen,” and finally handed\\ngiraud the letter signed “bella.”\\n\\ngiraud listened in silence, studied the letter attentively, and then\\nhanded it back.\\n\\n“all very interesting, m. le juge. but my theory remains unaffected.”\\n\\n“and your theory is?”\\n\\n“for the moment i prefer not to say. remember, i am only just beginning\\nmy investigations.”\\n\\n“tell me one thing, m. giraud,” said poirot suddenly. “your theory\\nallows for the door being opened. it does not explain why it was\\n_left___ open. when they departed, would it not have been natural for\\nthem to close it behind them. if a _sergent de ville___ had chanced to\\ncome up to the house, as is sometimes done to see that all is well,\\nthey might have been discovered and overtaken almost at once.”\\n\\n“bah! they forgot it. a mistake, i grant you.”\\n\\nthen, to my surprise, poirot uttered almost the same words as he had\\nuttered to bex the previous evening:\\n\\n“_i do not agree with you.___ the door being left open was the result\\nof either design or necessity, and any theory that does not admit that\\nfact is bound to prove vain.”\\n\\nwe all regarded the little man with a good deal of astonishment. the\\nconfession of ignorance drawn from him over the match end had, i\\nthought, been bound to humiliate him, but here he was self satisfied as\\never, laying down the law to the great giraud without a tremor.\\n\\nthe detective twisted his moustache, eyeing my friend in a somewhat\\nbantering fashion.\\n\\n“you don’t agree with me, eh? well, what strikes you particularly about\\nthe case. let’s hear your views.”\\n\\n“one thing presents itself to me as being significant. tell me, m.\\ngiraud, does nothing strike you as familiar about this case? is there\\nnothing it reminds you of?”\\n\\n“familiar? reminds me of? i can’t say off-hand. i don’t think so,\\nthough.”\\n\\n“you are wrong,” said poirot quietly. “a crime almost precisely similar\\nhas been committed before.”\\n\\n“when? and where?”\\n\\n“ah, that, unfortunately, i cannot for the moment remember—but i shall\\ndo so. i had hoped you might be able to assist me.”\\n\\ngiraud snorted incredulously.\\n\\n“there have been many affairs of masked men! i cannot remember the\\ndetails of them all. these crimes all resemble each other more or\\nless.”\\n\\n“there is such a thing as the individual touch.” poirot suddenly\\nassumed his lecturing manner, and addressed us collectively. “i am\\nspeaking to you now of the psychology of crime. m. giraud knows quite\\nwell that each criminal has his particular method, and that the police,\\nwhen called in to investigate—say a case of burglary—can often make a\\nshrewd guess at the offender, simply by the peculiar method he has\\nemployed. (japp would tell you the same, hastings.) man is an\\nunoriginal animal. unoriginal within the law in his daily respectable\\nlife, equally unoriginal outside the law. if a man commits a crime, any\\nother crime he commits will resemble it closely. the english murderer\\nwho disposed of his wives in succession by drowning them in their baths\\nwas a case in point. had he varied his methods, he might have escaped\\ndetection to this day. but he obeyed the common dictates of human\\nnature, arguing that what had once succeeded would succeed again, and\\nhe paid the penalty of his lack of originality.”\\n\\n“and the point of all this?” sneered giraud.\\n\\n“that when you have two crimes precisely similar in design and\\nexecution, you find the same brain behind them both. i am looking for\\nthat brain, m. giraud—and i shall find it. here we have a true clue—a\\npsychological clue. you may know all about cigarettes and match ends,\\nm. giraud, but i, hercule poirot, know the mind of man!” and the\\nridiculous little fellow tapped his forehead with emphasis.\\n\\ngiraud remained singularly unimpressed.\\n\\n“for your guidance,” continued poirot, “i will also advise you of one\\nfact which might fail to be brought to your notice. the wrist watch of\\nmadame renauld, on the day following the tragedy, had gained two hours.\\nit might interest you to examine it.”\\n\\ngiraud stared.\\n\\n“perhaps it was in the habit of gaining?”\\n\\n“as a matter of fact, i am told it did.”\\n\\n“_eh bien___, then!”\\n\\n“all the same, two hours is a good deal,” said poirot softly. “then\\nthere is the matter of the footprints in the flower-bed.”\\n\\nhe nodded his head towards the open window. giraud took two eager\\nstrides, and looked out.\\n\\n“this bed here?”\\n\\n“yes.”\\n\\n“but i see no footprints?”\\n\\n“no,” said poirot, straightening a little pile of books on a table.\\n“there are none.”\\n\\nfor a moment an almost murderous rage obscured giraud’s face. he took\\ntwo strides towards his tormentor, but at that moment the _salon___\\ndoor was opened, and marchaud announced.\\n\\n“m. stonor, the secretary, has just arrived from england. may he\\nenter?”\\n\\n\\n\\n10 gabriel stonor\\n\\nthe man who entered the room was a striking figure. very tall, with a\\nwell knit athletic frame, and a deeply bronzed face and neck, he\\ndominated the assembly. even giraud seemed anaemic beside him. when i\\nknew him better i realized that gabriel stonor was quite an unusual\\npersonality. english by birth, he had knocked about all over the world.\\nhe had shot big game in africa, travelled in korea, ranched in\\ncalifornia, and traded in the south sea islands. he had been secretary\\nto a new york railway magnate, and had spent a year encamped in the\\ndesert with a friendly tribe of arabs.\\n\\nhis unerring eye picked out m. hautet.\\n\\n“the examining magistrate in charge of the case? pleased to meet you,\\nm. le juge. this is a terrible business. how’s mrs. renauld? is she\\nbearing up fairly well? it must have been an awful shock to her.”\\n\\n“terrible, terrible,” said m. hautet. “permit me to introduce m.\\nbex—our commissary of police, m. giraud of the sûreté. this gentleman\\nis m. hercule poirot. m. renauld sent for him, but he arrived too late\\nto do anything to avert the tragedy. a friend of m. poirot’s, captain\\nhastings.”\\n\\nstonor looked at poirot with some interest.\\n\\n“sent for you, did he?”\\n\\n“you did not know, then, that m. renauld contemplated calling in a\\ndetective?” interposed m. bex.\\n\\n“no, i didn’t. but it doesn’t surprise me a bit.”\\n\\n“why?”\\n\\n“because the old man was rattled! i don’t know what it was all about.\\nhe didn’t confide in me. we weren’t on those terms. but rattled he\\nwas—and badly!”\\n\\n“h’m!” said m. hautet. “but you have no notion of the cause?”\\n\\n“that’s what i said, sir.”\\n\\n“you will pardon me, m. stonor, but we must begin with a few\\nformalities. your name?”\\n\\n“gabriel stonor.”\\n\\n“how long ago was it that you became secretary to m. renauld?”\\n\\n“about two years ago, when he first arrived from south america. i met\\nhim through a mutual friend, and he offered me the post. a thundering\\ngood boss he was too.”\\n\\n“did he talk to you much about his life in south america?”\\n\\n“yes, a good bit.”\\n\\n“do you know if he was ever in santiago?”\\n\\n“several times, i believe.”\\n\\n“he never mentioned any special incident that occurred there—anything\\nthat might have provoked some vendetta against him?”\\n\\n“never.”\\n\\n“did he speak of any secret that he had acquired whilst sojourning\\nthere?”\\n\\n“no.”\\n\\n“did he ever say anything at all about a secret?”\\n\\n“not that i can remember. but, for all that, there _was___ a mystery\\nabout him. i’ve never heard him speak of his boyhood for instance, or\\nof any incident prior to his arrival in south america. he was a french\\ncanadian by birth, i believe, but i’ve never heard him speak of his\\nlife in canada. he could shut up like a clam if he liked.”\\n\\n“so, as far as you know, he had no enemies, and you can give us no clue\\nas to any secret to obtain possession of which he might have been\\nmurdered?”\\n\\n“that’s so.”\\n\\n“m. stonor, have you ever heard the name of duveen in connection with\\nm. renauld?”\\n\\n“duveen. duveen.” he tried the name over thoughtfully. “i don’t think i\\nhave. and yet it seems familiar.”\\n\\n“do you know a lady, a friend of m. renauld’s whose christian name is\\nbella?”\\n\\nagain mr. stonor shook his head.\\n\\n“bella duveen? is that the full name? it’s curious! i’m sure i know it.\\nbut for the moment i can’t remember in what connection.”\\n\\nthe magistrate coughed.\\n\\n“you understand, m. stonor—the case is like this. _there must be no\\nreservations.___ you might, perhaps, through a feeling of consideration\\nfor madame renauld—for whom, i gather, you have a great esteem and\\naffection, you might—_enfin!___” said m. hautet getting rather tied up\\nin his sentence, “there must absolutely be no reservations.”\\n\\nstonor stared at him, a dawning light of comprehension in his eyes.\\n\\n“i don’t quite get you,” he said gently. “where does mrs. renauld come\\nin? i’ve an immense respect and affection for that lady; she’s a very\\nwonderful and unusual type, but i don’t quite see how my reservations,\\nor otherwise, could affect her?”\\n\\n“not if this bella duveen should prove to have been something more than\\na friend to her husband?”\\n\\n“ah!” said stonor. “i get you now. but i’ll bet my bottom dollar that\\nyou’re wrong. the old man never so much as looked at a petticoat. he\\njust adored his own wife. they were the most devoted couple i know.”\\n\\nm. hautet shook his head gently.\\n\\n“m. stonor, we hold absolute proof—a love letter written by this bella\\nto m. renauld, accusing him of having tired of her. moreover, we have\\nfurther proof that, at the time of his death, he was carrying on an\\nintrigue with a frenchwoman, a madame daubreuil, who rents the\\nadjoining villa. and this is the man who, according to you, never\\nlooked at a petticoat!”\\n\\nthe secretary’s eyes narrowed.\\n\\n“hold on, m. le juge. you’re barking up the wrong tree. i knew paul\\nrenauld. what you’ve just been saying is utterly impossible. there’s\\nsome other explanation.”\\n\\nthe magistrate shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n“what other explanation could there be?”\\n\\n“what leads you to think it was a love affair?”\\n\\n“madame daubreuil was in the habit of visiting him here in the\\nevenings. also, since m. renauld came to the villa geneviève, madame\\ndaubreuil has paid large sums of money into the bank in notes. in all,\\nthe amount totals four thousand pounds of your english money.”\\n\\n“i guess that’s right,” said stonor quietly. “i transmitted him those\\nsums at his request. but it wasn’t an intrigue.”\\n\\n“eh! _mon dieu!___ what else could it be?”\\n\\n“_blackmail___,” said stonor sharply, bringing down his hand with a\\nslam on the table. “that’s what it was.”\\n\\n“ah! voilà une idée!” cried the magistrate, shaken in spite of himself.\\n\\n“blackmail,” repeated stonor. “the old man was being bled—and at a good\\nrate too. four thousand in a couple of months. whew! i told you just\\nnow there was a mystery about renauld. evidently this madame daubreuil\\nknew enough of it to put the screws on.”\\n\\n“it is possible,” the commissary cried excitedly. “decidedly, it is\\npossible.”\\n\\n“possible?” roared stonor. “it’s certain! tell me, have you asked mrs.\\nrenauld about this love affair stunt of yours?”\\n\\n“no, monsieur. we did not wish to occasion her any distress if it could\\nreasonably be avoided.”\\n\\n“distress? why, she’d laugh in your face. i tell you, she and renauld\\nwere a couple in a hundred.”\\n\\n“ah, that reminds me of another point,” said m. hautet. “did m. renauld\\ntake you into his confidence at all as to the dispositions of his\\nwill?”\\n\\n“i know all about it—took it to the lawyer for him after he’d drawn it\\nout. i can give you the name of his solicitors if you want to see it.\\nthey’ve got it there. quite simple. half in trust to his wife for her\\nlifetime, the other half to his son. a few legacies. i rather think he\\nleft me a thousand.”\\n\\n“when was this will drawn up?”\\n\\n“oh, about a year and a half ago.”\\n\\n“would it surprise you very much, m. stonor, to hear that m. renauld\\nhad made another will, less than a fortnight ago?”\\n\\nstonor was obviously very much surprised.\\n\\n“i’d no idea of it. what’s it like?”\\n\\n“the whole of his vast fortune is left unreservedly to his wife. there\\nis no mention of his son.”\\n\\nmr. stonor gave vent to a prolonged whistle.\\n\\n“i call that rather rough on the lad. his mother adores him, of course,\\nbut to the world at large it looks rather like a want of confidence on\\nhis father’s part. it will be rather galling to his pride. still, it\\nall goes to prove what i told you, that renauld and his wife were on\\nfirst rate terms.”\\n\\n“quite so, quite so,” said m. hautet. “it is possible we shall have to\\nrevise our ideas on several points. we have, of course, cabled to\\nsantiago, and are expecting a reply from there any minute. in all\\npossibility, everything will then be perfectly clear and\\nstraightforward. on the other hand, if your suggestion of blackmail is\\ntrue, madame daubreuil ought to be able to give us valuable\\ninformation.”\\n\\npoirot interjected a remark:\\n\\n“m. stonor, the english chauffeur, masters, had he been long with m.\\nrenauld?”\\n\\n“over a year?”\\n\\n“have you any idea whether he has ever been in south america?”\\n\\n“i’m quite sure he hasn’t. before coming to mr. renauld, he had been\\nfor many years with some people in gloucestershire whom i know well.”\\n\\n“in fact, you can answer for him as being above suspicion?”\\n\\n“absolutely.”\\n\\npoirot seemed somewhat crest-fallen.\\n\\nmeanwhile the magistrate had summoned marchaud.\\n\\n“my compliments to madame renauld, and i should be glad to speak to her\\nfor a few minutes. beg her not to disturb herself. i will wait upon her\\nupstairs.”\\n\\nmarchaud saluted and disappeared.\\n\\nwe waited some minutes, and then, to our surprise, the door opened, and\\nmrs. renauld, deathly pale in her heavy mourning, entered the room.\\n\\nm. hautet brought forward a chair, uttering vigorous protestations, and\\nshe thanked him with a smile. stonor was holding one hand of hers in\\nhis with an eloquent sympathy. words evidently failed him. mrs. renauld\\nturned to m. hautet.\\n\\n“you wished to ask me something, m. le juge.”\\n\\n“with your permission, madame. i understand your husband was a french\\ncanadian by birth. can you tell me anything of his youth, or\\nupbringing?”\\n\\nshe shook her head.\\n\\n“my husband was always very reticent about himself, monsieur. he came\\nfrom the north west, i know, but i fancy that he had an unhappy\\nchildhood, for he never cared to speak of that time. our life was lived\\nentirely in the present and the future.”\\n\\n“was there any mystery in his past life?”\\n\\nmrs. renauld smiled a little, and shook her head.\\n\\n“nothing so romantic, i am sure, m. le juge.”\\n\\nm. hautet also smiled.\\n\\n“true, we must not permit ourselves to get melodramatic. there is one\\nthing more—” he hesitated.\\n\\nstonor broke in impetuously:\\n\\n“they’ve got an extraordinary idea into their heads mrs. renauld. they\\nactually fancy that mr. renauld was carrying on an intrigue with a\\nmadame daubreuil who, it seems, lives next door.”\\n\\nthe scarlet colour flamed into mrs. renauld’s cheeks. she flung her\\nhead up, then bit her lip, her face quivering. stonor stood looking at\\nher in astonishment, but m. bex leaned forward and said gently: “we\\nregret to cause you pain, madame, but have you any reason to believe\\nthat madame daubreuil was your husband’s mistress?”\\n\\nwith a sob of anguish, mrs. renauld buried her face in her hands. her\\nshoulders heaved convulsively. at last she lifted her head, and said\\nbrokenly:\\n\\n“she may have been.”\\n\\nnever, in all my life, have i seen anything to equal the blank\\namazement on stonor’s face. he was thoroughly taken aback.\\n\\n\\n\\n11 jack renauld\\n\\nwhat the next development of the conversation would have been, i cannot\\nsay, for at that moment the door was thrown violently open, and a tall\\nyoung man strode into the room.\\n\\njust for a moment i had the uncanny sensation that the dead man had\\ncome to life again. then i realized that this dark head was untouched\\nwith grey, and that, in point of fact, it was a mere boy who now burst\\nin among us with so little ceremony. he went straight to mrs. renauld\\nwith an impetuosity that took no heed of the presence of others.\\n\\n“mother!”\\n\\n“jack!” with a cry she folded him in her arms. “my dearest! but what\\nbrings you here? you were to sail on the _anzora___ from cherbourg two\\ndays ago?” then, suddenly recalling to herself the presence of others,\\nshe turned with a certain dignity, “my son, messieurs.”\\n\\n“aha!” said m. hautet, acknowledging the young man’s bow. “so you did\\nnot sail on the _anzora?___”\\n\\n“no, monsieur. as i was about to explain, the _anzora___ was detained\\ntwenty-four hours through engine trouble. i should have sailed last\\nnight instead of the night before, but, happening to buy an evening\\npaper, i saw in it an account of the—the awful tragedy that had\\nbefallen us—” his voice broke and the tears came into his eyes. “my\\npoor father—my poor, poor, father.”\\n\\nstaring at him like one in a dream, mrs. renauld repeated: “so you did\\nnot sail?” and then, with a gesture of infinite weariness, she murmured\\nas though to herself, “after all, it does not matter—now.”\\n\\n“sit down, m. renauld, i beg of you,” said m. hautet, indicating a\\nchair. “my sympathy for you is profound. it must have been a terrible\\nshock to you to learn the news as you did. however, it is most\\nfortunate that you were prevented from sailing. i am in hopes that you\\nmay be able to give us just the information we need to clear up this\\nmystery.”\\n\\n“i am at your disposal, m. le juge. ask me any questions you please.”\\n\\n“to begin with, i understand that this journey was being undertaken at\\nyour father’s request?”\\n\\n“quite so, m. le juge. i received a telegram bidding me to proceed\\nwithout delay to buenos ayres, and from thence via the andes to\\nvalparaiso and on to santiago.”\\n\\n“ah. and the object of this journey?”\\n\\n“i have no idea, m. le juge.”\\n\\n“what?”\\n\\n“no. see, here is the telegram.”\\n\\nthe magistrate took it and read it aloud.\\n\\n“\\u200a‘proceed immediately cherbourg embark _anzora___ sailing tonight\\nbuenos ayres. ultimate destination santiago. further instructions will\\nawait you buenos ayres. do not fail. matter is of utmost importance.\\nrenauld.’ and there had been no previous correspondence on the matter?”\\n\\njack renauld shook his head.\\n\\n“that is the only intimation of any kind. i knew, of course, that my\\nfather, having lived so long out there, had necessarily many interests\\nin south america. but he had never mooted any suggestion of sending me\\nout.”\\n\\n“you have, of course, been a good deal in south america, m. renauld?”\\n\\n“i was there as a child. but i was educated in england, and spent most\\nof my holidays in that country, so i really know far less of south\\namerica than might be supposed. you see, the war broke out when i was\\nseventeen.”\\n\\n“you served in the english flying corps, did you not?”\\n\\n“yes, m. le juge.”\\n\\nm. hautet nodded his head, and proceeded with his inquiries along the,\\nby now, well-known lines. in response, jack renauld declared definitely\\nthat he knew nothing of any enmity his father might have incurred in\\nthe city of santiago, or elsewhere in the south american continent,\\nthat he had noticed no change in his father’s manner of late, and that\\nhe had never heard him refer to a secret. he had regarded the mission\\nto south america as connected with business interests.\\n\\nas m. hautet paused for a minute, the quiet voice of giraud broke in.\\n\\n“i should like to put a few questions on my own account, m. le juge.”\\n\\n“by all means, m. giraud, if you wish,” said the magistrate coldly.\\n\\ngiraud edged his chair a little nearer to the table.\\n\\n“were you on good terms with your father, m. renauld?”\\n\\n“certainly i was,” returned the lad haughtily.\\n\\n“you assert that positively?”\\n\\n“yes.”\\n\\n“no little disputes, eh?”\\n\\njack shrugged his shoulders. “every one may have a difference of\\nopinion now and then.”\\n\\n“quite so, quite so. but if any one were to assert that you had a\\nviolent quarrel with your father on the eve of your departure for\\nparis, that person, without doubt, would be lying?”\\n\\ni could not but admire the ingenuity of giraud. his boast “i know\\neverything” had been no idle one. jack renauld was clearly disconcerted\\nby the question.\\n\\n“we—we did have an argument,” he admitted.\\n\\n“ah, an argument! in the course of that argument did you use this\\nphrase: ‘when you are dead, i can do as i please?’\\u200a”\\n\\n“i may have done,” muttered the other. “i don’t know.”\\n\\n“in response to that, did your father say: ‘but i am not dead yet!’ to\\nwhich you responded: ‘i wish you were!’\\u200a”\\n\\nthe boy made no answer. his hands fiddled nervously with the things on\\nthe table in front of him.\\n\\n“i must request an answer, please, m. renauld,” said giraud sharply.\\n\\nwith an angry exclamation, the boy swept a heavy paper-knife on to the\\nfloor.\\n\\n“what does it matter? you might as well know. yes, i did quarrel with\\nmy father. i dare say i said all those things—i was so angry i cannot\\neven remember what i said! i was furious—i could almost have killed him\\nat that moment—there, make the most of that!” he leant back in his\\nchair, flushed and defiant.\\n\\ngiraud smiled, then, moving his chair back a little, said:\\n\\n“that is all. you would, without doubt, prefer to continue the\\ninterrogatory, m. le juge.”\\n\\n“ah, yes, exactly,” said m. hautet. “and what was the subject of your\\nquarrel?”\\n\\n“i decline to state.”\\n\\nm. hautet sat up in his chair.\\n\\n“m. renauld, it is not permitted to trifle with the law!” he thundered.\\n“what was the subject of the quarrel?”\\n\\nyoung renauld remained silent, his boyish face sullen and overcast. but\\nanother voice spoke, imperturbable and calm, the voice of hercule\\npoirot.\\n\\n“i will inform you, if you like, m. le juge.”\\n\\n“you know?”\\n\\n“certainly i know. the subject of the quarrel was mademoiselle marthe\\ndaubreuil.”\\n\\nrenauld sprang round, startled. the magistrate leaned forward.\\n\\n“is this so, monsieur.”\\n\\njack renauld bowed his head.\\n\\n“yes,” he admitted. “i love mademoiselle daubreuil, and i wish to marry\\nher. when i informed my father of the fact, he flew at once into a\\nviolent rage. naturally i could not stand hearing the girl i loved\\ninsulted, and i, too, lost my temper.”\\n\\nm. hautet looked across at mrs. renauld.\\n\\n“you were aware of this—attachment, madame.”\\n\\n“i feared it,” she replied simply.\\n\\n“mother,” cried the boy. “you too! marthe is as good as she is\\nbeautiful. what can you have against her?”\\n\\n“i have nothing against mademoiselle daubreuil in any way. but i should\\nprefer you to marry an englishwoman, or if a frenchwoman not one who\\nhas a mother of doubtful antecedents!”\\n\\nher rancour against the older woman showed plainly in her voice, and i\\ncould well understand that it must have been a bitter blow to her when\\nher only son showed signs of falling in love with the daughter of her\\nrival.\\n\\nmrs. renauld continued, addressing the magistrate:\\n\\n“i ought, perhaps, to have spoken to my husband on the subject, but i\\nhoped that it was only a boy and girl flirtation which would blow over\\nall the quicker if no notice was taken of it. i blame myself now for my\\nsilence, but my husband, as i told you, had seemed so anxious and\\ncare-worn, different altogether from his normal self, that i was\\nchiefly concerned not to give him any additional worry.”\\n\\nm. hautet nodded.\\n\\n“when you informed your father of your intentions towards mademoiselle\\ndaubreuil,” he resumed, “he was surprised?”\\n\\n“he seemed completely taken aback. then he ordered me peremptorily to\\ndismiss any such idea from my mind. he would never give his consent to\\nsuch a marriage. nettled, i demanded what he had against mademoiselle\\ndaubreuil. to that he could give no satisfactory reply, but spoke in\\nslighting terms of the mystery surrounding the lives of the mother and\\ndaughter. i answered that i was marrying marthe, and not her\\nantecedents, but he shouted me down with a peremptory refusal to\\ndiscuss the matter in any way. the whole thing must be given up. the\\ninjustice and high-handedness of it all maddened me—especially since he\\nhimself always seemed to go out of his way to be attentive to the\\ndaubreuils and was always suggesting that they should be asked to the\\nhouse. i lost my head, and we quarrelled in earnest. my father reminded\\nme that i was entirely dependent on him, and it must have been in\\nanswer to that that i made the remark about doing as i pleased after\\nhis death—”\\n\\npoirot interrupted with a quick question.\\n\\n“you were aware, then, of the terms of your father’s will?”\\n\\n“i knew that he had left half his fortune to me, the other half in\\ntrust for my mother to come to me at her death,” replied the lad.\\n\\n“proceed with your story,” said the magistrate.\\n\\n“after that we shouted at each other in sheer rage, until i suddenly\\nrealized that i was in danger of missing my train to paris. i had to\\nrun for the station, still in a white heat of fury. however, once well\\naway, i calmed down. i wrote to marthe, telling her what had happened,\\nand her reply soothed me still further. she pointed out to me that we\\nhad only to be steadfast, and any opposition was bound to give way at\\nlast. our affection for each other must be tried and proved, and when\\nmy parents realized that it was no light infatuation on my part they\\nwould doubtless relent towards us. of course, to her, i had not dwelt\\non my father’s principal objection to the match. i soon saw that i\\nshould do my cause no good by violence. my father wrote me several\\nletters to paris, affectionate in tone, and which did not refer to our\\ndisagreement or its cause, and i replied in the same strain.”\\n\\n“you can produce those letters, eh?” said giraud.\\n\\n“i did not keep them.”\\n\\n“no matter,” said the detective.\\n\\nrenauld looked at him for a moment, but the magistrate was continuing\\nhis questions.\\n\\n“to pass to another matter, are you acquainted with the name of duveen,\\nm. renauld?”\\n\\n“duveen?” said jack. “duveen?” he leant forward, and slowly picked up\\nthe paper-knife he had swept from the table. as he lifted his head, his\\neyes met the watching ones of giraud. “duveen? no, i can’t say i am.”\\n\\n“will you read this letter, m. renauld? and tell me if you have any\\nidea as to who the person was who addressed it to your father?”\\n\\njack renauld took the letter, and read it through, the colour mounting\\nin his face as he did so.\\n\\n“addressed to my father?” the emotion and indignation in his tones were\\nevident.\\n\\n“yes. we found it in the pocket of his coat.”\\n\\n“does—” he hesitated, throwing the merest fraction of a glance towards\\nhis mother. the magistrate understood.\\n\\n“as yet—no. can you give us any clue as to the writer?”\\n\\n“i have no idea whatsoever.”\\n\\nm. hautet sighed.\\n\\n“a most mysterious case. ah, well, i suppose we can now rule out the\\nletter altogether. what do you think, m. giraud? it does not seem to\\nlead us anywhere.”\\n\\n“it certainly does not,” agreed the detective with emphasis.\\n\\n“and yet,” sighed the magistrate, “it promised at the beginning to be\\nsuch a beautiful and simple case!” he caught mrs. renauld’s eye, and\\nblushed in immediate confusion. “ah, yes,” he coughed, turning over the\\npapers on the table. “let me see, where were we? oh, the weapon. i fear\\nthis may give you pain, m. renauld. i understand it was a present from\\nyou to your mother. very sad—very distressing—”\\n\\njack renauld leaned forward. his face, which had flushed during the\\nperusal of the letter, was now deadly white.\\n\\n“do you mean—that it was with an aeroplane wire paper cutter that my\\nfather was—was killed? but it’s impossible! a little thing like that!”\\n\\n“alas, m. renauld, it is only too true! an ideal little tool, i fear.\\nsharp and easy to handle.”\\n\\n“where is it? can i see it? is it still in the—the body?”\\n\\n“oh, no, it had been removed. you would like to see it? to make sure?\\nit would be as well, perhaps, though madame has already identified it.\\nstill—m. bex, might i trouble you?”\\n\\n“certainly, m. le juge. i will fetch it immediately.”\\n\\n“would it not be better to take m. renauld to the shed?” suggested\\ngiraud smoothly. “without doubt he would wish to see his father’s\\nbody.”\\n\\nthe boy made a shivering gesture of negation, and the magistrate,\\nalways disposed to cross giraud whenever possible, replied.\\n\\n“but no—not at present. m. bex will be so kind as to bring it to us\\nhere.”\\n\\nthe commissary left the room. stonor crossed to jack, and wrung him by\\nthe hand. poirot had risen and was adjusting a pair of candlesticks\\nthat struck his trained eye as being a shade askew. the magistrate was\\nreading the mysterious love-letter through a last time, clinging\\ndesperately to his first theory of jealousy and a stab in the back.\\n\\nsuddenly the door burst open and the commissary rushed in.\\n\\n“m. le juge! m. le juge!”\\n\\n“but yes. what is it?”\\n\\n“the dagger! it is gone!”\\n\\n“_comment___—gone?”\\n\\n“vanished. disappeared. the glass jar that contained it is empty!”\\n\\n“what?” i cried. “impossible. why, only this morning i saw—” the words\\ndied on my tongue.\\n\\nbut the attention of the entire room was diverted to me.\\n\\n“what is that you say?” cried the commissary. “this morning?”\\n\\n“i saw it there this morning,” i said slowly. “about an hour and a half\\nago, to be accurate.”\\n\\n“you went to the shed, then? how did you get the key?”\\n\\n“i asked the _sergent de ville___ for it.”\\n\\n“and you went there? why?”\\n\\ni hesitated, but in the end i decided that the only thing to do was to\\nmake a clean breast of it.\\n\\n“m. le juge,” i said. “i have committed a grave fault, for which i must\\ncrave your indulgence.”\\n\\n“_eh bien!___ proceed, monsieur.”\\n\\n“the fact of the matter is,” i said, wishing myself anywhere else than\\nwhere i was, “that i met a young lady, an acquaintance of mine. she\\ndisplayed a great desire to see everything that was to be seen, and\\ni—well, in short, i took the key to show her the body.”\\n\\n“ah, _par exemple___,” cried the magistrate indignantly. “but it is a\\ngrave fault you have committed there, captain hastings. it is\\naltogether most irregular. you should not have permitted yourself this\\nfolly.”\\n\\n“i know,” i said meekly. “nothing that you can say could be too severe,\\nm. le juge.”\\n\\n“you did not invite this lady to come here?”\\n\\n“certainly not. i met her quite by accident. she is an english lady who\\nhappens to be staying in merlinville, though i was not aware of that\\nuntil my unexpected meeting with her.”\\n\\n“well, well,” said the magistrate, softening. “it was most irregular,\\nbut the lady is without doubt young and beautiful, _n’est-ce pas?___\\nwhat it is to be young! _o jeunesse, jeunesse!___” and he sighed\\nsentimentally.\\n\\nbut the commissary, less romantic, and more practical, took up the\\ntale:\\n\\n“but did not you reclose and lock the door when you departed.”\\n\\n“that’s just it,” i said slowly. “that’s what i blame myself for so\\nterribly. my friend was upset at the sight. she nearly fainted. i got\\nher some brandy and water, and afterwards insisted on accompanying her\\nback to town. in the excitement, i forgot to relock the door. i only\\ndid so when i got back to the villa.”\\n\\n“then for twenty minutes at least—” said the commissary slowly. he\\nstopped.\\n\\n“exactly,” i said.\\n\\n“twenty minutes,” mused the commissary.\\n\\n“it is deplorable,” said m. hautet, his sternness of manner returning.\\n“without precedent.”\\n\\nsuddenly another voice spoke.\\n\\n“you find it deplorable, m. le juge?” asked giraud.\\n\\n“certainly i do.”\\n\\n“_eh bien!___ i find it admirable,” said the other imperturbably.\\n\\nthis unexpected ally quite bewildered me.\\n\\n“admirable, m. giraud?” asked the magistrate, studying him cautiously\\nout of the corner of his eye.\\n\\n“precisely.”\\n\\n“and why?”\\n\\n“because we know now that the assassin, or an accomplice of the\\nassassin, has been near the villa only an hour ago. it will be strange\\nif, with that knowledge, we do not shortly lay hands upon him.” there\\nwas a note of menace in his voice. he continued: “he risked a good deal\\nto gain possession of that dagger. perhaps he feared that finger-prints\\nmight be discovered on it.”\\n\\npoirot turned to bex.\\n\\n“you said there were none?”\\n\\ngiraud shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n“perhaps he could not be sure.”\\n\\npoirot looked at him.\\n\\n“you are wrong, m. giraud. the assassin wore gloves. so he must have\\nbeen sure.”\\n\\n“i do not say it was the assassin himself. it may have been an\\naccomplice who was not aware of that fact.”\\n\\n“_ils sont mal renseignés, les accomplices!___” muttered poirot, but he\\nsaid no more.\\n\\nthe magistrate’s clerk was gathering up the papers on the table. m.\\nhautet addressed us:\\n\\n“our work here is finished. perhaps, m. renauld, you will listen whilst\\nyour evidence is read over to you. i have purposely kept all the\\nproceedings as informal as possible. i have been called original in my\\nmethods, but i maintain that there is much to be said for originality.\\nthe case is now in the clever hands of the renowned m. giraud. he will\\nwithout doubt distinguish himself. indeed, i wonder that he has not\\nalready laid his hands upon the murderers! madame, again let me assure\\nyou of my heart-felt sympathy. messieurs, i wish you all good day.”\\nand, accompanied by his clerk and the commissary, he took his\\ndeparture.\\n\\npoirot tugged out that large turnip of a watch of his, and observed the\\ntime.\\n\\n“let us return to the hotel for lunch, my friend,” he said. “and you\\nshall recount to me in full the indiscretions of this morning. no one\\nis observing us. we need make no adieux.”\\n\\nwe went quietly out of the room. the examining magistrate had just\\ndriven off in his car. i was going down the steps when poirot’s voice\\narrested me:\\n\\n“one little moment, my friend.” dexterously, he whipped out his yard\\nmeasure, and proceeded, quite solemnly, to measure an overcoat hanging\\nin the hall from the collar to the hem. i had not seen it hanging there\\nbefore, and guessed that it belonged to either mr. stonor, or jack\\nrenauld.\\n\\nthen, with a little satisfied grunt, poirot returned the measure to his\\npocket, and followed me out into the open air.\\n\\n\\n\\n12 poirot elucidates certain points\\n\\n“why did you measure that overcoat?” i asked, with some curiosity, as\\nwe walked down the hot white road at a leisurely pace.\\n\\n“_parbleu!___ to see how long it was,” replied my friend imperturbably.\\n\\ni was vexed. poirot’s incurable habit of making a mystery out of\\nnothing never failed to irritate me. i relapsed into silence, and\\nfollowed a train of thought of my own. although i had not noticed them\\nspecially at the time, certain words mrs. renauld had addressed to her\\nson now recurred to me, fraught with a new significance. “so you did\\nnot sail?” she had said, and then had added: “_after all, it does not\\nmatter—now.___”\\n\\nwhat had she meant by that? the words were enigmatical—significant. was\\nit possible that she knew more than we supposed? she had denied all\\nknowledge of the mysterious mission with which her husband was to have\\nentrusted his son. but was she really less ignorant than she pretended?\\ncould she enlighten us if she chose, and was her silence part of a\\ncarefully thought out and preconceived plan?\\n\\nthe more i thought about it, the more i was convinced that i was right.\\nmrs. renauld knew more than she chose to tell. in her surprise at\\nseeing her son, she had momentarily betrayed herself. i felt convinced\\nthat she knew, if not the assassins, at least the motive for the\\nassassination. but some very powerful considerations must keep her\\nsilent.\\n\\n“you think profoundly, my friend,” remarked poirot, breaking in upon my\\nreflections. “what is it that intrigues you so?”\\n\\ni told him, sure of my ground, though feeling expectant that he would\\nridicule my suspicions. but to my surprise he nodded thoughtfully.\\n\\n“you are quite right, hastings. from the beginning i have been sure\\nthat she was keeping something back. at first i suspected her, if not\\nof inspiring, at least of conniving at the crime.”\\n\\n“you suspected _her?___” i cried.\\n\\n“but certainly! she benefits enormously—in fact, by this new will, she\\nis the only person to benefit. so, from the start, she was singled out\\nfor attention. you may have noticed that i took an early opportunity of\\nexamining her wrists. i wished to see whether there was any possibility\\nthat she had gagged and bound herself. _eh bien___, i saw at once that\\nthere was no fake, the cords had actually been drawn so tight as to cut\\ninto the flesh. that ruled out the possibility of her having committed\\nthe crime single-handed. but it was still possible for her to have\\nconnived at it, or to have been the instigator with an accomplice.\\nmoreover, the story, as she told it, was singularly familiar to me—the\\nmasked men that she could not recognize, the mention of ‘the secret’—i\\nhad heard, or read, all these things before. another little detail\\nconfirmed my belief that she was not speaking the truth. _the wrist\\nwatch, hastings, the wrist watch!___”\\n\\nagain that wrist watch! poirot was eyeing me curiously.\\n\\n“you see, _mon ami?___ you comprehend?”\\n\\n“no,” i replied with some ill humour. “i neither see nor comprehend.\\nyou make all these confounded mysteries, and it’s useless asking you to\\nexplain. you always like keeping everything up your sleeve to the last\\nminute.”\\n\\n“do not enrage yourself, my friend,” said poirot with a smile. “i will\\nexplain if you wish. but not a word to giraud, _c’est entendu?___ he\\ntreats me as an old one of no importance! _we shall see!___ in common\\nfairness i gave him a hint. if he does not choose to act upon it, that\\nis his own look out.”\\n\\ni assured poirot that he could rely upon my discretion.\\n\\n“_c’est bien!___ let us then employ our little grey cells. tell me, my\\nfriend, at what time, according to you, did the tragedy take place?”\\n\\n“why, at two o’clock or thereabouts,” i said, astonished. “you\\nremember, mrs. renauld told us that she heard the clock strike while\\nthe men were in the room.”\\n\\n“exactly, and on the strength of that, you, the examining magistrate,\\nbex, and every one else, accept the time without further question. but\\ni, hercule poirot, say that madame renauld lied. _the crime took place\\nat least two hours earlier.___”\\n\\n“but the doctors—”\\n\\n“they declared, after examination of the body, that death had taken\\nplace between ten and seven hours previously. _mon ami___, for some\\nreason, it was imperative that the crime should seem to have taken\\nplace later than it actually did. you have read of a smashed watch or\\nclock recording the exact hour of a crime? so that the time should not\\nrest on mrs. renauld’s testimony alone, some one moved on the hands of\\nthat wrist watch to two o’clock, and then dashed it violently to the\\nground. but, as is often the case, they defeated their own object. the\\nglass was smashed, but the mechanism of the watch was uninjured. it was\\na most disastrous manoeuvre on their part, for it at once drew my\\nattention to two points—first, that madame renauld was lying: secondly,\\nthat there must be some vital reason for the postponement of the time.”\\n\\n“but what reason could there be?”\\n\\n“ah, that is the question! there we have the whole mystery. as yet, i\\ncannot explain it. there is only one idea that presents itself to me as\\nhaving a possible connection.”\\n\\n“and that is?”\\n\\n“the last train left merlinville at seventeen minutes past twelve.”\\n\\ni followed it out slowly.\\n\\n“so that, the crime apparently taking place some two hours later, any\\none leaving by that train would have an unimpeachable alibi!”\\n\\n“perfect, hastings! you have it!”\\n\\ni sprang up.\\n\\n“but we must inquire at the station. surely they cannot have failed to\\nnotice two foreigners who left by that train! we must go there at\\nonce!”\\n\\n“you think so, hastings?”\\n\\n“of course. let us go there now.”\\n\\npoirot restrained my ardour with a light touch upon the arm.\\n\\n“go by all means if you wish, _mon ami___—but if you go, i should not\\nask for particulars of two foreigners.”\\n\\ni stared, and he said rather impatiently:\\n\\n“là, là, you do not believe all that rigmarole, do you? the masked men\\nand all the rest of _cette histoire-là!___”\\n\\nhis words took me so much aback that i hardly knew how to respond. he\\nwent on serenely:\\n\\n“you heard me say to giraud, did you not, that all the details of this\\ncrime were familiar to me? _eh bien___, that presupposes one of two\\nthings, either the brain that planned the first crime also planned this\\none, or else an account read of a _cause célèbre___ unconsciously\\nremained in our assassin’s memory and prompted the details. i shall be\\nable to pronounce definitely on that after—” he broke off.\\n\\ni was revolving sundry matters in my mind.\\n\\n“but mr. renauld’s letter? it distinctly mentions a secret and\\nsantiago?”\\n\\n“undoubtedly there was a secret in m. renauld’s life—there can be no\\ndoubt of that. on the other hand, the word santiago, to my mind, is a\\nred herring, dragged continually across the track to put us off the\\nscent. it is possible that it was used in the same way on m. renauld,\\nto keep him from directing his suspicions into a quarter nearer at\\nhand. oh, be assured, hastings, the danger that threatened him was not\\nin santiago, it was near at hand, in france.”\\n\\nhe spoke so gravely, and with such assurance, that i could not fail to\\nbe convinced. but i essayed one final objection:\\n\\n“and the match and cigarette end found near the body? what of them.”\\n\\na light of pure enjoyment lit up poirot’s face.\\n\\n“planted! deliberately planted there for giraud or one of his tribe to\\nfind! ah, he is smart, giraud, he can do his tricks! so can a good\\nretriever dog. he comes in so pleased with himself. for hours he has\\ncrawled on his stomach. ‘see what i have found,’ he says. and then\\nagain to me: ‘what do you see here?’ me, i answer, with profound and\\ndeep truth, ‘nothing.’ and giraud, the great giraud, he laughs, he\\nthinks to himself, ‘oh, that he is imbecile, this old one!’ _but we\\nshall see.\\u200a…___”\\n\\nbut my mind had reverted to the main facts.\\n\\n“then all this story of the masked men—?”\\n\\n“is false.”\\n\\n“what really happened?”\\n\\npoirot shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n“one person could tell us—madame renauld. but she will not speak.\\nthreats and entreaties would not move her. a remarkable woman that,\\nhastings. i recognized as soon as i saw her that i had to deal with a\\nwoman of unusual character. at first, as i told you, i was inclined to\\nsuspect her of being concerned in the crime. afterwards i altered my\\nopinion.”\\n\\n“what made you do that?”\\n\\n“her spontaneous and genuine grief at the sight of her husband’s body.\\ni could swear that the agony in that cry of hers was genuine.”\\n\\n“yes,” i said thoughtfully, “one cannot mistake these things.”\\n\\n“i beg your pardon, my friend—one can always be mistaken. regard a\\ngreat actress, does not her acting of grief carry you away and impress\\nyou with its reality? no, however strong my own impression and belief,\\ni needed other evidence before i allowed myself to be satisfied. the\\ngreat criminal can be a great actor. i base my certainty in this case,\\nnot upon my own impression, but upon the undeniable fact that mrs.\\nrenauld actually fainted. i turned up her eyelids and felt her pulse.\\nthere was no deception—the swoon was genuine. therefore i was satisfied\\nthat her anguish was real and not assumed. besides, a small additional\\npoint not without interest, it was unnecessary for mrs. renauld to\\nexhibit unrestrained grief. she had had one paroxysm on learning of her\\nhusband’s death, and there would be no need for her to simulate another\\nsuch a violent one on beholding his body. no, mrs. renauld was not her\\nhusband’s murderess. but why has she lied? she lied about the wrist\\nwatch, she lied about the masked men—she lied about a third thing. tell\\nme, hastings, what is your explanation of the open door?”\\n\\n“well,” i said, rather embarrassed, “i suppose it was an oversight.\\nthey forgot to shut it.”\\n\\npoirot shook his head, and sighed.\\n\\n“that is the explanation of giraud. it does not satisfy me. there is a\\nmeaning behind that open door which for a moment i cannot fathom.”\\n\\n“i have an idea,” i cried suddenly.\\n\\n“_a la bonne heure!___ let us hear it.”\\n\\n“listen. we are agreed that mrs. renauld’s story is a fabrication. is\\nit not possible, then, that mr. renauld left the house to keep an\\nappointment—possibly with the murderer—leaving the front door open for\\nhis return. but he did not return, and the next morning he is found,\\nstabbed in the back.”\\n\\n“an admirable theory, hastings, but for two facts which you have\\ncharacteristically overlooked. in the first place, who gagged and bound\\nmadame renauld? and why on earth should they return to the house to do\\nso? in the second place, no man on earth would go out to keep an\\nappointment wearing his underclothes and an overcoat. there are\\ncircumstances in which a man might wear pajamas and an overcoat—but the\\nother, never!”\\n\\n“true,” i said, rather crest-fallen.\\n\\n“no,” continued poirot, “we must look elsewhere for a solution of the\\nopen door mystery. one thing i am fairly sure of—they did not leave\\nthrough the door. they left by the window.”\\n\\n“what?”\\n\\n“precisely.”\\n\\n“but there were no footmarks in the flower bed underneath.”\\n\\n“no—_and there ought to have been.___ listen, hastings. the gardener,\\nauguste, as you heard him say, planted both those beds the preceding\\nafternoon. in the one there are plentiful impressions of his big\\nhobnailed boots—in the other, _none!___ you see? some one had passed\\nthat way, some one who, to obliterate their footprints, smoothed over\\nthe surface of the bed with a rake.”\\n\\n“where did they get a rake?”\\n\\n“where they got the spade and the gardening gloves,” said poirot\\nimpatiently. “there is no difficulty about that.”\\n\\n“what makes you think that they left that way, though? surely it is\\nmore probable that they entered by the window, and left by the door.”\\n\\n“that is possible of course. yet i have a strong idea that they left by\\nthe window.”\\n\\n“i think you are wrong.”\\n\\n“perhaps, _mon ami___.”\\n\\ni mused, thinking over the new field of conjecture that poirot’s\\ndeductions had opened up to me. i recalled my wonder at his cryptic\\nallusions to the flower bed and the wrist watch. his remarks had seemed\\nso meaningless at the moment and now, for the first time, i realized\\nhow remarkably, from a few slight incidents, he had unravelled much of\\nthe mystery that surrounded the case. i paid a belated homage to my\\nfriend. as though he read my thoughts, he nodded sagely.\\n\\n“method, you comprehend! method! arrange your facts. arrange your\\nideas. and if some little fact will not fit in—do not reject it but\\nconsider it closely. though its significance escapes you, be sure that\\nit is significant.”\\n\\n“in the meantime,” i said, considering, “although we know a great deal\\nmore than we did, we are no nearer to solving the mystery of who killed\\nmr. renauld.”\\n\\n“no,” said poirot cheerfully. “in fact we are a great deal further\\noff.”\\n\\nthe fact seemed to afford him such peculiar satisfaction that i gazed\\nat him in wonder. he met my eye and smiled.\\n\\n“but yes, it is better so. before, there was at all events a clear\\ntheory as to how and by whose hands he met his death. now that is all\\ngone. we are in darkness. a hundred conflicting points confuse and\\nworry us. that is well. that is excellent. out of confusion comes forth\\norder. but if you find order to start with, if a crime seems simple and\\nabove-board, _eh bien, méfiez vous!___ it is, how do you say\\nit?—_cooked!___ the great criminal is simple—but very few criminals\\n_are___ great. in trying to cover up their tracks, they invariably\\nbetray themselves. ah, _mon ami___, i would that some day i could meet\\na really great criminal—one who commits his crime, and then—does\\nnothing! even i, hercule poirot, might fail to catch such a one.”\\n\\nbut i had not followed his words. a light had burst upon me.\\n\\n“poirot! mrs. renauld! i see it now. she must be shielding somebody.”\\n\\nfrom the quietness with which poirot received my remark, i could see\\nthat the idea had already occurred to him.\\n\\n“yes,” he said thoughtfully. “shielding some one—or screening some one.\\none of the two.”\\n\\ni saw very little difference between the two words, but i developed my\\ntheme with a good deal of earnestness. poirot maintained a strictly\\nnon-committal attitude, repeating:\\n\\n“it may be—yes, it may be. but as yet i do not know! there is something\\nvery deep underneath all this. you will see. something very deep.”\\n\\nthen, as we entered our hotel, he enjoined silence on me with a\\ngesture.\\n\\n\\n\\n13 the girl with the anxious eyes\\n\\nwe lunched with an excellent appetite. i understood well enough that\\npoirot did not wish to discuss the tragedy where we could so easily be\\noverheard. but, as is usual when one topic fills the mind to the\\nexclusion of everything else, no other subject of interest seemed to\\npresent itself. for a while we ate in silence, and then poirot observed\\nmaliciously:\\n\\n“_eh bien!___ and your indiscretions! you recount them not?”\\n\\ni felt myself blushing.\\n\\n“oh, you mean this morning?” i endeavoured to adopt a tone of absolute\\nnonchalance.\\n\\nbut i was no match for poirot. in a very few minutes he had extracted\\nthe whole story from me, his eyes twinkling as he did so.\\n\\n“_tiens!___ a story of the most romantic. what is her name, this\\ncharming young lady?”\\n\\ni had to confess that i did not know.\\n\\n“still more romantic! the first _rencontre___ in the train from paris,\\nthe second here. journeys end in lovers’ meetings, is not that the\\nsaying?”\\n\\n“don’t be an ass, poirot.”\\n\\n“yesterday it was mademoiselle daubreuil, today it is\\nmademoiselle—cinderella! decidedly you have the heart of a turk,\\nhastings! you should establish a harem!”\\n\\n“it’s all very well to rag me. mademoiselle daubreuil is a very\\nbeautiful girl, and i do admire her immensely—i don’t mind admitting\\nit. the other’s nothing—don’t suppose i shall ever see her again. she\\nwas quite amusing to talk to just for a railway journey, but she’s not\\nthe kind of girl i should ever get keen on.”\\n\\n“why?”\\n\\n“well—it sounds snobbish perhaps—but she’s not a lady, not in any sense\\nof the word.”\\n\\npoirot nodded thoughtfully. there was less raillery in his voice as he\\nasked:\\n\\n“you believe, then, in birth and breeding?”\\n\\n“i may be old-fashioned, but i certainly don’t believe in marrying out\\nof one’s class. it never answers.”\\n\\n“i agree with you, _mon ami___. ninety-nine times out of a hundred, it\\nis as you say. but there is always the hundredth time! still, that does\\nnot arise, as you do not propose to see the lady again.”\\n\\nhis last words were almost a question, and i was aware of the sharpness\\nwith which he darted a glance at me. and before my eyes, writ large in\\nletters of fire, i saw the words “hôtel du phare,” and i heard again\\nher voice saying “come and look me up” and my own answering with\\n_empressement___: “i will.”\\n\\nwell, what of it? i had meant to go at the time. but since then, i had\\nhad time to reflect. i did not like the girl. thinking it over in cold\\nblood, i came definitely to the conclusion that i disliked her\\nintensely. i had got hauled over the coals for foolishly gratifying her\\nmorbid curiosity, and i had not the least wish to see her again.\\n\\ni answered poirot lightly enough.\\n\\n“she asked me to look her up, but of course i shan’t.”\\n\\n“why ‘of course’?”\\n\\n“well—i don’t want to.”\\n\\n“i see.” he studied me attentively for some minutes. “yes. i see very\\nwell. and you are wise. stick to what you have said.”\\n\\n“that seems to be your invariable advice,” i remarked, rather piqued.\\n\\n“ah, my friend, have faith in papa poirot. some day, if you permit, i\\nwill arrange you a marriage of great suitability.”\\n\\n“thank you,” i said laughing, “but the prospect leaves me cold.”\\n\\npoirot sighed and shook his head.\\n\\n“_les anglais!___” he murmured. “no method—absolutely none whatever.\\nthey leave all to chance!” he frowned, and altered the position of the\\nsalt cellar.\\n\\n“mademoiselle cinderella is staying at the hôtel d’angleterre you told\\nme, did you not?”\\n\\n“no. hôtel du phare.”\\n\\n“true, i forgot.”\\n\\na moment’s misgiving shot across my mind. surely i had never mentioned\\nany hotel to poirot. i looked across at him, and felt reassured. he was\\ncutting his bread into neat little squares, completely absorbed in his\\ntask. he must have fancied i had told him where the girl was staying.\\n\\nwe had coffee outside facing the sea. poirot smoked one of his tiny\\ncigarettes, and then drew his watch from his pocket.\\n\\n“the train to paris leaves at 2:25,” he observed. “i should be\\nstarting.”\\n\\n“paris?” i cried.\\n\\n“that is what i said, _mon ami___.”\\n\\n“you are going to paris? but why?”\\n\\nhe replied very seriously.\\n\\n“to look for the murderer of m. renauld.”\\n\\n“you think he is in paris?”\\n\\n“i am quite certain that he is not. nevertheless, it is there that i\\nmust look for him. you do not understand, but i will explain it all to\\nyou in good time. believe me, this journey to paris is necessary. i\\nshall not be away long. in all probability i shall return tomorrow. i\\ndo not propose that you should accompany me. remain here and keep an\\neye on giraud. also cultivate the society of m. renauld _fils___. and\\nthirdly, if you wish, endeavour to cut him out with mademoiselle\\nmarthe. but i fear you will not have great success.”\\n\\ni did not quite relish the last remark.\\n\\n“that reminds me,” i said. “i meant to ask you how you knew about those\\ntwo?”\\n\\n“_mon ami___—i know human nature. throw together a boy young renauld\\nand a beautiful girl like mademoiselle marthe, and the result is almost\\ninevitable. then, the quarrel! it was money or a woman and, remembering\\nléonie’s description of the lad’s anger, i decided on the latter. so i\\nmade my guess—and i was right.”\\n\\n“and that was why you warned me against setting my heart on the lady?\\nyou already suspected that she loved young renauld?”\\n\\npoirot smiled.\\n\\n“at any rate—_i saw that she had anxious eyes.___ that is how always\\nthink of mademoiselle daubreuil _as the girl with the anxious\\neyes.\\u200a…___”\\n\\nhis voice was so grave that it impressed me uncomfortably.\\n\\n“what do you mean by that, poirot?”\\n\\n“i fancy, my friend, that we shall see before very long. but i must\\nstart.”\\n\\n“you’ve oceans of time.”\\n\\n“perhaps—perhaps. but i like plenty of leisure at the station. i do not\\nwish to rush, to hurry, to excite myself.”\\n\\n“at all events,” i said, rising, “i will come and see you off.”\\n\\n“you will do nothing of the sort. i forbid it.”\\n\\nhe was so peremptory that i stared at him in surprise. he nodded\\nemphatically.\\n\\n“i mean it, _mon ami___. au revoir! you permit that i embrace you? ah,\\nno, i forget that it is not the english custom. une poignee de main,\\nalors.”\\n\\ni felt rather at a loose end after poirot had left me. i strolled down\\nthe beach, and watched the bathers, without feeling energetic enough to\\njoin them. i rather fancied that cinderella might be disporting herself\\namongst them in some wonderful costume, but i saw no signs of her. i\\nstrolled aimlessly along the sands towards the further end of the town.\\nit occurred to me that, after all, it would only be decent feeling on\\nmy part to inquire after the girl. and it would save trouble in the\\nend. the matter would then be finished with. there would be no need for\\nme to trouble about her any further. but, if i did not go at all, she\\nmight quite possibly come and look me up at the villa. and that would\\nbe annoying in every way. decidedly it would be better to pay a short\\ncall, in the course of which i could make it quite clear that i could\\ndo nothing further for her in my capacity of showman.\\n\\naccordingly i left the beach, and walked inland. i soon found the hôtel\\ndu phare, a very unpretentious building. it was annoying in the extreme\\nnot to know the lady’s name and, to save my dignity, i decided to\\nstroll inside and look around. probably i should find her in the\\nlounge. merlinville was a small place, you left your hotel to go to the\\nbeach, and you left the beach to return to the hotel. there were no\\nother attractions. there was a casino being built, but it was not yet\\ncompleted.\\n\\ni had walked the length of the beach without seeing her, therefore she\\nmust be in the hotel. i went in. several people were sitting in the\\ntiny lounge, but my quarry was not amongst them. i looked into some\\nother rooms, but there was no sign of her. i waited for some time, till\\nmy impatience got the better of me. i took the concierge aside, and\\nslipped five francs into his hand.\\n\\n“i wish to see a lady who is staying here. a young english lady, small\\nand dark. i am not sure of her name.”\\n\\nthe man shook his head, and seemed to be suppressing a grin.\\n\\n“there is no such lady as you describe staying here.”\\n\\n“she is american possibly,” i suggested. these fellows are so stupid.\\n\\nbut the man continued to shake his head.\\n\\n“no, monsieur. there are only six or seven english and american ladies\\naltogether, and they are all much older than the lady you are seeking.\\nit is not here that you will find her, monsieur.”\\n\\nhe was so positive that i felt doubts.\\n\\n“but the lady told me she was staying here.”\\n\\n“monsieur must have made a mistake—or it is more likely the lady did,\\nsince there has been another gentleman here inquiring for her.”\\n\\n“what is that you say?” i cried, surprised.\\n\\n“but yes, monsieur. a gentleman who described her just as you have\\ndone.”\\n\\n“what was he like?”\\n\\n“he was a small gentleman, well dressed, very neat, very spotless, the\\nmoustache very stiff, the head of a peculiar shape, and the eyes\\ngreen.”\\n\\npoirot! so that was why he refused to let me accompany him to the\\nstation. the impertinence of it! i would thank him not to meddle in my\\nconcerns. did he fancy i needed a nurse to look after me? thanking the\\nman, i departed, somewhat at a loss, and still much incensed with my\\nmeddlesome friend. i regretted that he was, for the moment, out of\\nreach. i should have enjoyed telling him what i thought of his\\nunwarranted interference. had i not distinctly told him that i had no\\nintention of seeing the girl? decidedly, one’s friends can be too\\nzealous!\\n\\nbut where was the lady? i set aside my wrath, and tried to puzzle it\\nout. evidently, through inadvertence, she had named the wrong hotel.\\nthen another thought struck me. was it inadvertence? or had she\\ndeliberately withheld her name and given me the wrong address? the more\\ni thought about it, the more i felt convinced that this last surmise of\\nmine was right. for some reason or other she did not wish to let the\\nacquaintance ripen into friendship. and though half an hour earlier\\nthis had been precisely my own view, i did not enjoy having the tables\\nturned upon me. the whole affair was profoundly unsatisfactory, and i\\nwent up to the villa geneviève in a condition of distinct ill humour. i\\ndid not go to the house, but went up the path to the little bench by\\nthe shed, and sat there moodily enough.\\n\\ni was distracted from my thoughts by the sound of voices close at hand.\\nin a second or two i realized that they came, not from the garden i was\\nin, but from the adjoining garden of the villa marguerite, and that\\nthey were approaching rapidly. a girl’s voice was speaking, a voice\\nthat i recognized as that of the beautiful marthe.\\n\\n“_chéri___,” she was saying, “is it really true? are all our troubles\\nover.”\\n\\n“you know it, marthe,” jack renauld replied. “nothing can part us now,\\nbeloved. the last obstacle to our union is removed. nothing can take\\nyou from me.”\\n\\n“nothing?” the girl murmured. “oh, jack, jack—i am afraid.”\\n\\ni had moved to depart, realizing that i was quite unintentionally\\neavesdropping. as i rose to my feet, i caught sight of them through a\\ngap in the hedge. they stood together facing me, the man’s arm round\\nthe girl, his eyes looking into hers. they were a splendid looking\\ncouple, the dark, well-knit boy, and the fair young goddess. they\\nseemed made for each other as they stood there, happy in spite of the\\nterrible tragedy that overshadowed their young lives.\\n\\nbut the girl’s face was troubled, and jack renauld seemed to recognize\\nit, as he held her closer to him and asked:\\n\\n“but what are you afraid of, darling? what is there to fear—now?”\\n\\nand then i saw the look in her eyes, the look poirot had spoken of, as\\nshe murmured, so that i almost guessed at the words.\\n\\n“i am afraid—for _you___.\\u200a…”\\n\\ni did not hear young renauld’s answer, for my attention was distracted\\nby an unusual appearance a little further down the hedge. there\\nappeared to be a brown bush there, which seemed odd, to say the least\\nof it, so early in the summer. i stepped along to investigate, but, at\\nmy advance, the brown bush withdrew itself precipitately, and faced me\\nwith a finger to its lips. it was giraud.\\n\\nenjoining caution, he led the way round the shed until we were out of\\near-shot.\\n\\n“what were you doing there?” i asked.\\n\\n“exactly what you were doing—listening.”\\n\\n“but i was not there on purpose!”\\n\\n“ah!” said giraud. “i was.”\\n\\nas always, i admired the man whilst disliking him. he looked me up and\\ndown with a sort of contemptuous disfavour.\\n\\n“you didn’t help matters by butting in. i might have heard something\\nuseful in a minute. what have you done with your old fossil?”\\n\\n“m. poirot has gone to paris,” i replied coldly.\\n\\n“and i can tell you, m. giraud, that he is anything but an old fossil.\\nhe has solved many cases that have completely baffled the english\\npolice.”\\n\\n“bah! the english police!” giraud snapped his fingers disdainfully.\\n“they must be on a level with our examining magistrates. so he has gone\\nto paris, has he? well, a good thing. the longer he stays there, the\\nbetter. but what does he think he will find there?”\\n\\ni thought i read in the question a tinge of uneasiness. i drew myself\\nup.\\n\\n“that i am not at liberty to say,” i said quietly.\\n\\ngiraud subjected me to a piercing stare.\\n\\n“he has probably enough sense not to tell _you___,” he remarked rudely.\\n“good afternoon. i’m busy.”\\n\\nand with that, he turned on his heel, and left me without ceremony.\\nmatters seemed at a standstill at the villa geneviève. giraud evidently\\ndid not desire my company and, from what i had seen, it seemed fairly\\ncertain that jack renauld did not either.\\n\\ni went back to the town, had an enjoyable bath and returned to the\\nhotel. i turned in early, wondering whether the following day would\\nbring forth anything of interest.\\n\\ni was wholly unprepared for what it did bring forth. i was eating my\\npetit déjeuner in the dining-room, when the waiter, who had been\\ntalking to some one outside, came back in obvious excitement. he\\nhesitated for a minute, fidgeting with his napkin, and then burst out.\\n\\n“monsieur will pardon me, but he is connected, is he not, with the\\naffair at the villa geneviève?’\\n\\n“yes,” i said eagerly. “why?”\\n\\n“monsieur has not heard the news, though?”\\n\\n“what news?”\\n\\n“that there has been another murder there last night!”\\n\\n“_what?___”\\n\\nleaving my breakfast, i caught up my hat and ran as fast as i could.\\nanother murder—and poirot away! what fatality. but who had been\\nmurdered?\\n\\ni dashed in at the gate. a group of the servants was in the drive,\\ntalking and gesticulating. i caught hold of françoise.\\n\\n“what has happened?”\\n\\n“oh, monsieur! monsieur! another death! it is terrible. there is a\\ncurse upon the house. but yes, i say it, a curse! they should send for\\nm. le curé to bring some holy water. never will i sleep another night\\nunder that roof. it might be my turn, who knows?”\\n\\nshe crossed herself.\\n\\n“yes,” i cried, “but who has been killed?”\\n\\n“do i know—me? a man—a stranger. they found him up there—in the\\nshed—not a hundred yards from where they found poor monsieur. and that\\nis not all. he is stabbed—stabbed to the heart _with the same\\ndagger!___”\\n\\n\\n\\n14 the second body\\n\\nwaiting for no more, i turned and ran up the path to the shed. the two\\nmen on guard there stood aside to let me pass and, filled with\\nexcitement, i entered.\\n\\nthe light was dim, the place was a mere rough wooden erection to keep\\nold pots and tools in. i had entered impetuously, but on the threshold\\ni checked myself, fascinated by the spectacle before me.\\n\\ngiraud was on his hands and knees, a pocket torch in his hand with\\nwhich he was examining every inch of the ground. he looked up with a\\nfrown at my entrance, then his face relaxed a little in a sort of\\ngood-humoured contempt.\\n\\n“ah, _c’est l’anglais!___ enter then. let us see what you can make of\\nthis affair.”\\n\\nrather stung by his tone, i stooped my head, and passed in.\\n\\n“there he is,” said giraud, flashing his torch to the far corner.\\n\\ni stepped across.\\n\\nthe dead man lay straight upon his back. he was of medium height,\\nswarthy of complexion, and possibly about fifty years of age. he was\\nneatly dressed in a dark blue suit, well cut and probably made by an\\nexpensive tailor, but not new. his face was terribly convulsed, and on\\nhis left side, just over the heart, the hilt of a dagger stood up,\\nblack and shining. i recognized it. it was the same dagger i had seen\\nreposing in the glass jar the preceding morning!\\n\\n“i’m expecting the doctor any minute,” explained giraud. “although we\\nhardly need him. there’s no doubt what the man died of. he was stabbed\\nto the heart, and death must have been pretty well instantaneous.”\\n\\n“when was it done? last night?”\\n\\ngiraud shook his head.\\n\\n“hardly. i don’t lay down the law on medical evidence, but the man’s\\nbeen dead well over twelve hours. when do you say you last saw that\\ndagger?”\\n\\n“about ten o’clock yesterday morning.”\\n\\n“then i should be inclined to fix the crime as being done not long\\nafter that.”\\n\\n“but people were passing and repassing this shed continually.”\\n\\ngiraud laughed disagreeably.\\n\\n“you progress to a marvel! who told you he was killed in this shed?”\\n\\n“well—” i felt flustered. “i—i assumed it.”\\n\\n“oh, what a fine detective! look at him, _mon petit___—does a man\\nstabbed to the heart fall like that—neatly with his feet together, and\\nhis arms to his side? no. again does a man lie down on his back and\\npermit himself to be stabbed without raising a hand to defend himself?\\nit is absurd, is it not? but see here—and here—” he flashed the torch\\nalong the ground. i saw curious irregular marks in the soft dirt. “he\\nwas dragged here after he was dead. half dragged, half carried by two\\npeople. their tracks do not show on the hard ground outside, and here\\nthey have been careful to obliterate them—but one of the two was a\\nwoman, my young friend.”\\n\\n“a woman?”\\n\\n“yes.”\\n\\n“but if the tracks are obliterated, how do you know?”\\n\\n“because, blurred as they are, the prints of the woman’s shoe are\\nunmistakable. also, by _this___—” and, leaning forward, he drew\\nsomething from the handle of the dagger and held it up for me to see.\\nit was a woman’s long black hair—similar to the one poirot had taken\\nfrom the arm-chair in the library.\\n\\nwith a slightly ironic smile he wound it round the dagger again.\\n\\n“we will leave things as they are as much as possible,” he explained.\\n“it pleases the examining magistrate. _eh bien___, do you notice\\nanything else?”\\n\\ni was forced to shake my head.\\n\\n“look at his hands.”\\n\\ni did. the nails were broken and discoloured, and the skin was hard. it\\nhardly enlightened me as much as i should have liked it to have done. i\\nlooked up at giraud.\\n\\n“they are not the hands of a gentleman,” he said, answering my look.\\n“on the contrary his clothes are those of a well-to-do man. that is\\ncurious, is it not?”\\n\\n“very curious,” i agreed.\\n\\n“and none of his clothing is marked. what do we learn from that? this\\nman was trying to pass himself off as other than he was. he was\\nmasquerading. why? did he fear something? was he trying to escape by\\ndisguising himself? as yet we do not know, but one thing we do know—he\\nwas as anxious to conceal his identity as we are to discover it.”\\n\\nhe looked down at the body again.\\n\\n“as before there are no finger-prints on the handle of the dagger. the\\nmurderer again wore gloves.”\\n\\n“you think, then, that the murderer was the same in both cases?” i\\nasked eagerly.\\n\\ngiraud became inscrutable.\\n\\n“never mind what i think. we shall see. marchaud!”\\n\\nthe _sergent de ville___ appeared at the doorway.\\n\\n“monsieur?”\\n\\n“why is madame renauld not here? i sent for her a quarter of an hour\\nago?”\\n\\n“she is coming up the path now, monsieur, and her son with her.”\\n\\n“good. i only want one at a time, though.”\\n\\nmarchaud saluted and disappeared again. a moment later he reappeared\\nwith mrs. renauld.\\n\\n“here is madame.”\\n\\ngiraud came forward with a curt bow.\\n\\n“this way, madame.” he led her across, and then, standing suddenly\\naside. “here is the man. do you know him?”\\n\\nand as he spoke, his eyes, gimlet-like, bored into her face, seeking to\\nread her mind, noting every indication of her manner.\\n\\nbut mrs. renauld remained perfectly calm—too calm, i felt. she looked\\ndown at the corpse almost without interest, certainly without any sign\\nof agitation or recognition.\\n\\n“no,” she said. “i have never seen him in my life. he is quite a\\nstranger to me.”\\n\\n“you are sure?”\\n\\n“quite sure.”\\n\\n“you do not recognize in him one of your assailants, for instance?”\\n\\n“no,” she seemed to hesitate, as though struck by the idea. “no, i do\\nnot think so. of course they wore beards—false ones the examining\\nmagistrate thought, but still—no.” now she seemed to make her mind up\\ndefinitely. “i am sure neither of the two was this man.”\\n\\n“very well, madame. that is all, then.”\\n\\nshe stepped out with head erect, the sun flashing on the silver threads\\nin her hair. jack renauld succeeded her. he, too, failed to identify\\nthe man, in a completely natural manner.\\n\\ngiraud merely grunted. whether he was pleased or chagrined i could not\\ntell. he merely called to marchaud:\\n\\n“you have got the other there?”\\n\\n“yes, monsieur.”\\n\\n“bring her in then.”\\n\\n“the other” was madame daubreuil. she came indignantly, protesting with\\nvehemence.\\n\\n“i object, monsieur! this is an outrage! what have i to do with all\\nthis?”\\n\\n“madame,” said giraud brutally, “i am investigating not one murder, but\\ntwo murders! for all i know you may have committed them both.”\\n\\n“how dare you?” she cried. “how dare you insult me by such a wild\\naccusation! it is infamous.”\\n\\n“infamous, is it? what about this?” stooping, he again detached the\\nhair, and held it up. “do you see this, madame?” he advanced towards\\nher. “you permit that i see whether it matches?”\\n\\nwith a cry she started backwards, white to the lips.\\n\\n“it is false—i swear it. i know nothing of the crime—of either crime.\\nany one who says i do lies! ah! _mon dieu___, what shall i do?”\\n\\n“calm yourself, madame,” said giraud coldly. “no one has accused you as\\nyet. but you will do well to answer my questions without more ado.”\\n\\n“anything you wish, monsieur.”\\n\\n“look at the dead man. have you ever seen him before?”\\n\\ndrawing nearer, a little of the colour creeping back to her face,\\nmadame daubreuil looked down at the victim with a certain amount of\\ninterest and curiosity. then she shook her head.\\n\\n“i do not know him.”\\n\\nit seemed impossible to doubt her, the words came so naturally. giraud\\ndismissed her with a nod of the head. “you are letting her go?” i asked\\nin a low voice. “is that wise? surely that black hair is from her\\nhead.”\\n\\n“i do not need teaching my business,” said giraud dryly. “she is under\\nsurveillance. i have no wish to arrest her as yet.”\\n\\nthen, frowning, he gazed down at the body.\\n\\n“should you say that was a spanish type at all?” he asked suddenly.\\n\\ni considered the face carefully.\\n\\n“no,” i said at last. “i should put him down as a frenchman most\\ndecidedly.”\\n\\ngiraud gave a grunt of dissatisfaction.\\n\\n“same here.”\\n\\nhe stood there for a moment, then with an imperative gesture he waved\\nme aside, and once more, on hands and knees, he continued his search of\\nthe floor of the shed. he was marvellous. nothing escaped him. inch by\\ninch he went over the floor, turning over pots, examining old sacks. he\\npounced on a bundle by the door, but it proved to be only a ragged coat\\nand trousers, and he flung it down again with a snarl. two pairs of old\\ngloves interested him, but in the end he shook his head and laid them\\naside. then he went back to the pots, methodically turning them over\\none by one. in the end, he rose to his feet, and shook his head\\nthoughtfully. he seemed baffled and perplexed. i think he had forgotten\\nmy presence.\\n\\nbut, at that moment, a stir and bustle was heard outside, and our old\\nfriend, the examining magistrate, accompanied by his clerk and m. bex,\\nwith the doctor behind him, came bustling in.\\n\\n“but this is extraordinary, mr. giraud,” cried m. hautet. “another\\ncrime! ah, we have not got to the bottom of this case. there is some\\ndeep mystery here. but who is the victim this time?”\\n\\n“that is just what nobody can tell us, m. le juge. he has not been\\nidentified.”\\n\\n“where is the body?” asked the doctor.\\n\\ngiraud moved aside a little.\\n\\n“there in the corner. he has been stabbed to the heart, as you see. and\\nwith the dagger that was stolen yesterday morning. i fancy that the\\nmurder followed hard upon the theft—but that is for you to say. you can\\nhandle the dagger freely—there are no finger-prints on it.”\\n\\nthe doctor knelt down by the dead man, and giraud turned to the\\nexamining magistrate.\\n\\n“a pretty little problem, is it not? but i shall solve it.”\\n\\n“and so no one can identify him,” mused the magistrate. “could it\\npossibly be one of the assassins? they may have fallen out among\\nthemselves.”\\n\\ngiraud shook his head.\\n\\n“the man is a frenchman—i would take my oath of that—”\\n\\nbut at that moment they were interrupted by the doctor who was sitting\\nback on his heels with a perplexed expression.\\n\\n“you say he was killed yesterday morning?”\\n\\n“i fix it by the theft of the dagger,” explained giraud. “he may, of\\ncourse, have been killed later in the day.”\\n\\n“later in the day? fiddlesticks! this man has been dead at least\\nforty-eight hours, and probably longer.”\\n\\nwe stared at each other in blank amazement.\\n\\n\\n\\n15 a photograph\\n\\nthe doctor’s words were so surprising that we were all momentarily\\ntaken aback. here was a man stabbed with a dagger which we knew to have\\nbeen stolen only twenty-four hours previously, and yet dr. durand\\nasserted positively that he had been dead at least forty-eight hours!\\nthe whole thing was fantastic to the last extreme.\\n\\nwe were still recovering from the surprise of the doctor’s\\nannouncement, when a telegram was brought to me. it had been sent up\\nfrom the hotel to the villa. i tore it open. it was from poirot, and\\nannounced his return by the train arriving at merlinville at 12:28.\\n\\ni looked at my watch and saw that i had just time to get comfortably to\\nthe station and meet him there. i felt that it was of the utmost\\nimportance that he should know at once of the new and startling\\ndevelopments in the case.\\n\\nevidently, i reflected, poirot had had no difficulty in finding what he\\nwanted in paris. the quickness of his return proved that. very few\\nhours had sufficed. i wondered how he would take the exciting news i\\nhad to impart.\\n\\nthe train was some minutes late, and i strolled aimlessly up and down\\nthe platform, until it occurred to me that i might pass the time by\\nasking a few questions as to who had left merlinville by the last train\\non the evening of the tragedy.\\n\\ni approached the chief porter, an intelligent looking man, and had\\nlittle difficulty in persuading him to enter upon the subject. it was a\\ndisgrace to the police, he hotly affirmed, that such brigands of\\nassassins should be allowed to go about unpunished. i hinted that there\\nwas some possibility they might have left by the midnight train, but he\\nnegatived the idea decidedly. he would have noticed two foreigners—he\\nwas sure of it. only about twenty people had left by the train, and he\\ncould not have failed to observe them.\\n\\ni do not know what put the idea into my head—possibly it was the deep\\nanxiety underlying marthe daubreuil’s tones—but i asked suddenly:\\n\\n“young m. renauld—he did not leave by that train, did he?”\\n\\n“ah, no, monsieur. to arrive and start off again within half an hour,\\nit would not be amusing, that!”\\n\\ni stared at the man, the significance of his words almost escaping me.\\nthen i saw.\\u200a…\\n\\n“you mean,” i said, my heart beating a little, “that m. jack renauld\\narrived at merlinville that evening?”\\n\\n“but yes, monsieur. by the last train arriving the other way, the\\n11:40.”\\n\\nmy brain whirled. that, then, was the reason of marthe’s poignant\\nanxiety. jack renauld had been in merlinville on the night of the\\ncrime! but why had he not said so? why, on the contrary, had he led us\\nto believe that he had remained in cherbourg? remembering his frank\\nboyish countenance, i could hardly bring myself to believe that he had\\nany connection with the crime. yet why this silence on his part about\\nso vital a matter? one thing was certain, marthe had known all along.\\nhence her anxiety, and her eager questioning of poirot to know whether\\nany one were suspected.\\n\\nmy cogitations were interrupted by the arrival of the train, and in\\nanother moment i was greeting poirot. the little man was radiant. he\\nbeamed and vociferated and, forgetting my english reluctance, embraced\\nme warmly on the platform.\\n\\n“_mon cher ami___, i have succeeded—but succeeded to a marvel!”\\n\\n“indeed? i’m delighted to hear it. have you heard the latest here?”\\n\\n“how would you that i should hear anything? there have been some\\ndevelopments, eh? the brave giraud, he has made an arrest? or even\\narrests perhaps? ah, but i will make him look foolish, that one! but\\nwhere are you taking me, my friend? do we not go to the hotel? it is\\nnecessary that i attend to my moustaches—they are deplorably limp from\\nthe heat of travelling. also, without doubt, there is dust on my coat.\\nand my tie, that i must rearrange.”\\n\\ni cut short his remonstrances.\\n\\n“my dear poirot—never mind all that. we must go to the villa at once.\\n_there has been another murder!___”\\n\\ni have frequently been disappointed when fancying that i was giving\\nnews of importance to my friend. either he has known it already or he\\nhas dismissed it as irrelevant to the main issue—and in the latter case\\nevents have usually proved him justified. but this time i could not\\ncomplain of missing my effect. never have i seen a man so\\nflabbergasted. his jaw dropped. all the jauntiness went out of his\\nbearing. he stared at me open-mouthed.\\n\\n“what is that you say? another murder? ah, then, i am all wrong. i have\\nfailed. giraud may mock himself at me—he will have reason!”\\n\\n“you did not expect it, then?”\\n\\n“i? not the least in the world. it demolishes my theory—it ruins\\neverything—it—ah, no!” he stopped dead, thumping himself on the chest.\\n“it is impossible. i _cannot___ be wrong! the facts, taken methodically\\nand in their proper order admit of only one explanation. i must be\\nright! i _am___ right!”\\n\\n“but then—”\\n\\nhe interrupted me.\\n\\n“wait, my friend. i must be right, therefore this new murder is\\nimpossible unless—unless—oh, wait, i implore you. say no word—”\\n\\nhe was silent for a moment or two, then, resuming his normal manner, he\\nsaid in a quiet assured voice: “the victim is a man of middle-age. his\\nbody was found in the locked shed near the scene of the crime and had\\nbeen dead at least forty-eight hours. and it is most probable that he\\nwas stabbed in a similar manner to m. renauld, though not necessarily\\nin the back.”\\n\\nit was my turn to gape—and gape i did. in all my knowledge of poirot he\\nhad never done anything so amazing as this. and, almost inevitably, a\\ndoubt crossed my mind.\\n\\n“poirot,” i cried, “you’re pulling my leg. you’ve heard all about it\\nalready.”\\n\\nhe turned his earnest gaze upon me reproachfully.\\n\\n“would i do such a thing? i assure you that i have heard nothing\\nwhatsoever. did you not observe the shock your news was to me?”\\n\\n“but how on earth could you know all that?”\\n\\n“i was right then? but i knew it. the little grey cells, my friend, the\\nlittle grey cells! they told me. thus, and in no other way, could there\\nhave been a second death. now tell me all. if we go round to the left\\nhere, we can take a short cut across the golf links which will bring us\\nto the back of the villa geneviève much more quickly.”\\n\\nas we walked, taking the way he had indicated, i recounted all i knew.\\npoirot listened attentively.\\n\\n“the dagger was in the wound, you say? that is curious. you are sure it\\nwas the same one?”\\n\\n“absolutely certain. that’s what make it so impossible.”\\n\\n“nothing is impossible. there may have been two daggers.”\\n\\ni raised my eyebrows.\\n\\n“surely that is in the highest degree unlikely? it would be a most\\nextraordinary coincidence.”\\n\\n“you speak as usual, without reflection, hastings. in some cases two\\nidentical weapons _would___ be highly improbable. but not here. this\\nparticular weapon was a war souvenir which was made to jack renauld’s\\norders. it is really highly unlikely, when you come to think of it,\\nthat he should have had only one made. very probably he would have\\nanother for his own use.”\\n\\n“but nobody has mentioned such a thing,” i objected.\\n\\na hint of the lecturer crept into poirot’s tone. “my friend, in working\\nupon a case, one does not take into account only the things that are\\n‘mentioned.’ there is no reason to mention many things which may be\\nimportant. equally, there is often an excellent reason for _not___\\nmentioning them. you can take your choice of the two motives.”\\n\\ni was silent, impressed in spite of myself. another few minutes brought\\nus to the famous shed. we found all our friends there and, after an\\ninterchange of polite amenities, poirot began his task.\\n\\nhaving watched giraud at work, i was keenly interested. poirot bestowed\\nbut a cursory glance on the surroundings. the only thing he examined\\nwas the ragged coat and trousers by the door. a disdainful smile rose\\nto giraud’s lips, and, as though noting it, poirot flung the bundle\\ndown again.\\n\\n“old clothes of the gardener’s?” he queried.\\n\\n“exactly,” said giraud.\\n\\npoirot knelt down by the body. his fingers were rapid but methodical.\\nhe examined the texture of the clothes, and satisfied himself that\\nthere were no marks on them. the boots he subjected to special care,\\nalso the dirty and broken finger-nails. whilst examining the latter he\\nthrew a quick question at giraud.\\n\\n“you saw these?”\\n\\n“yes, i saw them,” replied the other. his face remained inscrutable.\\n\\nsuddenly poirot stiffened.\\n\\n“dr. durand!”\\n\\n“yes?” the doctor came forward.\\n\\n“there is foam on the lips. you observed it?”\\n\\n“i didn’t notice it, i must admit.”\\n\\n“but you observe it now?”\\n\\n“oh, certainly.”\\n\\npoirot again shot a question at giraud.\\n\\n“you noticed it without doubt?”\\n\\nthe other did not reply. poirot proceeded. the dagger had been\\nwithdrawn from the wound. it reposed in a glass jar by the side of the\\nbody. poirot examined it, then he studied the wound closely. when he\\nlooked up, his eyes were excited, and shone with the green light i knew\\nso well.\\n\\n“it is a strange wound, this! it has not bled. there is no stain on the\\nclothes. the blade of the dagger is slightly discoloured, that is all.\\nwhat do you think, m. le docteur?”\\n\\n“i can only say that it is most abnormal.”\\n\\n“it is not abnormal at all. it is most simple. the man was stabbed\\n_after he was dead___.” and, stilling the clamour of voices that arose\\nwith a wave of his hand, poirot turned to giraud and added, “m. giraud\\nagrees with me, do you not, monsieur?”\\n\\nwhatever giraud’s real belief, he accepted the position without moving\\na muscle. calmly and almost scornfully he replied:\\n\\n“certainly i agree.”\\n\\nthe murmur of surprise and interest broke out again.\\n\\n“but what an idea!” cried m. hautet. “to stab a man after he is dead!\\nbarbaric! unheard of! some unappeasable hate, perhaps.”\\n\\n“no, m. le juge,” said poirot. “i should fancy it was done quite\\ncold-bloodedly—to create an impression.”\\n\\n“what impression?”\\n\\n“the impression it nearly did create,” returned poirot oracularly.\\n\\nm. bex had been thinking.\\n\\n“how, then, was the man killed?”\\n\\n“he was not killed. he died. he died, m. le juge, if i am not much\\nmistaken, of an epileptic fit!”\\n\\nthis statement of poirot’s again aroused considerable excitement. dr.\\ndurand knelt down again, and made a searching examination. at last he\\nrose to his feet.\\n\\n“well, m. le docteur?”\\n\\n“m. poirot, i am inclined to believe that you are correct in your\\nassertion. i was misled to begin with. the incontrovertible fact that\\nthe man had been stabbed distracted my attention from any other\\nindications.”\\n\\npoirot was the hero of the hour. the examining magistrate was profuse\\nin compliments. poirot responded gracefully, and then excused himself\\non the pretext that neither he nor i had yet lunched, and that he\\nwished to repair the ravages of the journey. as we were about to leave\\nthe shed, giraud approached us.\\n\\n“one more thing, m. poirot,” he said, in his suave mocking voice. “we\\nfound this coiled round the handle of the dagger. a woman’s hair.”\\n\\n“ah!” said poirot. “a woman’s hair? what woman’s, i wonder?”\\n\\n“i wonder also,” said giraud. then, with a bow, he left us.\\n\\n“he was insistent, the good giraud,” said poirot thoughtfully, as we\\nwalked towards the hotel. “i wonder in what direction he hopes to\\nmislead me? a woman’s hair—h’m!”\\n\\nwe lunched heartily, but i found poirot somewhat distrait and\\ninattentive. afterwards we went up to our sitting-room and there i\\nbegged him to tell me something of his mysterious journey to paris.\\n\\n“willingly, my friend. i went to paris to find _this___.”\\n\\nhe took from his pocket a small faded newspaper cutting. it was the\\nreproduction of a woman’s photograph. he handed it to me. i uttered an\\nexclamation.\\n\\n“you recognize it, my friend?”\\n\\ni nodded. although the photo obviously dated from very many years back,\\nand the hair was dressed in a different style, the likeness was\\nunmistakable.\\n\\n“madame daubreuil!” i exclaimed.\\n\\npoirot shook his head with a smile.\\n\\n“not quite correct, my friend. she did not call herself by that name in\\nthose days. that is a picture of the notorious madame beroldy!”\\n\\nmadame beroldy! in a flash the whole thing came back to me. the murder\\ntrial that had evoked such world-wide interest.\\n\\n\\n_the beroldy case.___\\n\\n\\n\\n16 the beroldy case\\n\\nsome twenty years or so before the opening of the present story,\\nmonsieur arnold beroldy, a native of lyons, arrived in paris\\naccompanied by his pretty wife and their little daughter, a mere babe.\\nmonsieur beroldy was a junior partner in a firm of wine merchants, a\\nstout middle-aged man, fond of the good things of life, devoted to his\\ncharming wife, and altogether unremarkable in every way. the firm in\\nwhich monsieur beroldy was a partner was a small one, and although\\ndoing well, it did not yield a large income to the junior partner. the\\nberoldys had a small apartment and lived in a very modest fashion to\\nbegin with.\\n\\nbut unremarkable though monsieur beroldy might be, his wife was\\nplentifully gilded with the brush of romance. young and good looking,\\nand gifted withal with a singular charm of manner, madame beroldy at\\nonce created a stir in the quarter, especially when it began to be\\nwhispered that some interesting mystery surrounded her birth. it was\\nrumoured that she was the illegitimate daughter of a russian grand\\nduke. others asserted that it was an austrian archduke, and that the\\nunion was legal, though morganatic. but all stories agreed upon one\\npoint, that jeanne beroldy was the centre of an interesting mystery.\\nquestioned by the curious, madame beroldy did not deny these rumours.\\non the other hand she let it be clearly understood that, though her\\n“lips” were “sealed,” all these stories had a foundation in fact. to\\nintimate friends she unburdened herself further, spoke of political\\nintrigues, of “papers,” of obscure dangers that threatened her. there\\nwas also much talk of crown jewels that were to be sold secretly, with\\nherself acting as the go-between.\\n\\namongst the friends and acquaintances of the beroldys was a young\\nlawyer, georges conneau. it was soon evident that the fascinating\\njeanne had completely enslaved his heart. madame beroldy encouraged the\\nyoung man in a discreet fashion, but being always careful to affirm her\\ncomplete devotion to her middle-aged husband. nevertheless, many\\nspiteful persons did not hesitate to declare that young conneau was her\\nlover—and not the only one!\\n\\nwhen the beroldys had been in paris about three months, another\\npersonage came upon the scene. this was mr. hiram p. trapp, a native of\\nthe united states, and extremely wealthy. introduced to the charming\\nand mysterious madame beroldy, he fell a prompt victim to her\\nfascinations. his admiration was obvious, though strictly respectful.\\n\\nabout this time, madame beroldy became more outspoken in her\\nconfidences. to several friends, she declared herself greatly worried\\non her husband’s behalf. she explained that he had been drawn into\\nseveral schemes of a political nature, and also referred to some\\nimportant papers that had been entrusted to him for safekeeping and\\nwhich concerned a “secret” of far reaching european importance. they\\nhad been entrusted to his custody to throw pursuers off the track, but\\nmadame beroldy was nervous, having recognized several important members\\nof the revolutionary circle in paris.\\n\\non the 28th day of november, the blow fell. the woman who came daily to\\nclean and cook for the beroldys was surprised to find the door of the\\napartment standing wide open. hearing faint moans issuing from the\\nbedroom, she went in. a terrible sight met her eyes. madame beroldy lay\\non the floor, bound hand and foot, uttering feeble moans, having\\nmanaged to free her mouth from a gag. on the bed was monsieur beroldy,\\nlying in a pool of blood, with a knife driven through his heart.\\n\\nmadame beroldy’s story was clear enough. suddenly awakened from sleep,\\nshe had discerned two masked men bending over her. stifling her cries,\\nthey had bound and gagged her. they had then demanded of monsieur\\nberoldy the famous “secret.”\\n\\nbut the intrepid wine merchant refused point-blank to accede to their\\nrequest. angered by his refusal, one of the men incontinently stabbed\\nhim through the heart. with the dead man’s keys, they had opened the\\nsafe in the corner, and had carried away with them a mass of papers.\\nboth men were heavily bearded, and had worn masks, but madame beroldy\\ndeclared positively that they were russians.\\n\\nthe affair created an immense sensation. it was referred to variously\\nas “the nihilist atrocity,” “revolutionaries in paris,” and the\\n“russian mystery.” time went on, and the mysterious bearded men were\\nnever traced. and then, just as public interest was beginning to die\\ndown, a startling development occurred. madame beroldy was arrested and\\ncharged with the murder of her husband.\\n\\nthe trial, when it came on, aroused widespread interest. the youth and\\nbeauty of the accused, and her mysterious history, were sufficient to\\nmake of it a _cause célèbre___. people ranged themselves wildly for or\\nagainst the prisoner. but her partisans received several severe checks\\nto their enthusiasm. the romantic past of madame beroldy, her royal\\nblood, and the mysterious intrigues in which she had her being were\\nshown to be mere fantasies of the imagination.\\n\\nit was proved beyond doubt that jeanne beroldy’s parents were a highly\\nrespectable and prosaic couple, fruit merchants, who lived on the\\noutskirts of lyons. the russian grand duke, the court intrigues, and\\nthe political schemes—all the stories current were traced back to—the\\nlady herself! from her brain had emanated these ingenious myths, and\\nshe was proved to have raised a considerable sum of money from various\\ncredulous persons by her fiction of the “crown jewels”—the jewels in\\nquestion being found to be mere paste imitations. remorselessly the\\nwhole story of her life was laid bare. the motive for the murder was\\nfound in mr. hiram p. trapp. mr. trapp did his best, but relentlessly\\nand agilely cross-questioned he was forced to admit that he loved the\\nlady, and that, had she been free, he would have asked her to be his\\nwife. the fact that the relations between them were admittedly platonic\\nstrengthened the case against the accused. debarred from becoming his\\nmistress by the simple honourable nature of the man, jeanne beroldy had\\nconceived the monstrous project of ridding herself of her elderly\\nundistinguished husband, and becoming the wife of the rich american.\\n\\nthroughout, madame beroldy confronted her accusers with complete sang\\nfroid and self possession. her story never varied. she continued to\\ndeclare strenuously that she was of royal birth, and that she had been\\nsubstituted for the daughter of the fruit seller at an early age.\\nabsurd and completely unsubstantiated as these statements were, a great\\nnumber of people believed implicitly in their truth.\\n\\nbut the prosecution was implacable. it denounced the masked “russians”\\nas a myth, and asserted that the crime had been committed by madame\\nberoldy and her lover, georges conneau. a warrant was issued for the\\narrest of the latter, but he had wisely disappeared. evidence showed\\nthat the bonds which secured madame beroldy were so loose that she\\ncould easily have freed herself.\\n\\nand then, towards the close of the trial, a letter, posted in paris,\\nwas sent to the public prosecutor. it was from georges conneau and,\\nwithout revealing his whereabouts, it contained a full confession of\\nthe crime. he declared that he had indeed struck the fatal blow at\\nmadame beroldy’s instigation. the crime had been planned between them.\\nbelieving that her husband ill-treated her, and maddened by his own\\npassion for her, a passion which he believed her to return, he had\\nplanned the crime and struck the fatal blow that should free the woman\\nhe loved from a hateful bondage. now, for the first time, he learnt of\\nmr. hiram p. trapp, and realized that the woman he loved had betrayed\\nhim! not for his sake did she wish to be free—but in order to marry the\\nwealthy american. she had used him as a cat’s-paw, and now, in his\\njealous rage, he turned and denounced her, declaring that throughout he\\nhad acted at her instigation.\\n\\nand then madame beroldy proved herself the remarkable woman she\\nundoubtedly was. without hesitation, she dropped her previous defence,\\nand admitted that the “russians” were a pure invention on her part. the\\nreal murderer was georges conneau. maddened by passion, he had\\ncommitted the crime, vowing that if she did not keep silence he would\\nenact a terrible vengeance from her. terrified by his threats, she had\\nconsented—also fearing it likely that if she told the truth she might\\nbe accused of conniving at the crime. but she had steadfastly refused\\nto have anything more to do with her husband’s murderer, and it was in\\nrevenge for this attitude on her part that he had written this letter\\naccusing her. she swore solemnly that she had had nothing to do with\\nthe planning of the crime, that she had awoke on that memorable night\\nto find georges conneau standing over her, the blood-stained knife in\\nhis hand.\\n\\nit was a touch and go affair. madame beroldy’s story was hardly\\ncredible. but this woman, whose fairy tales of royal intrigues had been\\nso easily accepted, had the supreme art of making herself believed. her\\naddress to the jury was a masterpiece. the tears streaming down her\\nface, she spoke of her child, of her woman’s honour—of her desire to\\nkeep her reputation untarnished for the child’s sake. she admitted\\nthat, georges conneau having been her lover, she might perhaps be held\\nmorally responsible for the crime—but, before god, nothing more! she\\nknew that she had committed a grave fault in not denouncing conneau to\\nthe law, but she declared in a broken voice that that was a thing no\\nwoman could have done.\\u200a… she had loved him! could she let her hand be\\nthe one to send him to the guillotine? she had been guilty of much, but\\nshe was innocent of the terrible crime imputed to her.\\n\\nhowever that may have been, her eloquence and personality won the day.\\nmadame beroldy, amidst a scene of unparalleled excitement, was\\nacquitted. despite the utmost endeavours of the police, georges conneau\\nwas never traced. as for madame beroldy, nothing more was heard of her.\\ntaking the child with her, she left paris to begin a new life.\\n\\n\\n\\n17 we make further investigations\\n\\ni have set down the beroldy case in full. of course all the details did\\nnot present themselves to my memory as i have recounted them here.\\nnevertheless, i recalled the case fairly accurately. it had attracted a\\ngreat deal of interest at the time, and had been fully reported by the\\nenglish papers, so that it did not need much effort of memory on my\\npart to recollect the salient details.\\n\\njust for the moment, in my excitement, it seemed to clear up the whole\\nmatter. i admit that i am impulsive, and poirot deplores my custom of\\njumping to conclusions, but i think i had some excuse in this instance.\\nthe remarkable way in which this discovery justified poirot’s point of\\nview struck me at once.\\n\\n“poirot,” i said, “i congratulate you. i see everything now.”\\n\\n“if that is indeed the truth, _i___ congratulate _you___, _mon ami___.\\nfor as a rule you are not famous for seeing—eh, is it not so?”\\n\\ni felt a little annoyed.\\n\\n“come now, don’t rub it in. you’ve been so confoundedly mysterious all\\nalong with your hints and your insignificant details that any one might\\nfail to see what you were driving at.”\\n\\npoirot lit one of his little cigarettes with his usual precision. then\\nhe looked up.\\n\\n“and since you see everything now, _mon ami___, what exactly is it that\\nyou see?”\\n\\n“why, that it was madame daubreuil—beroldy, who murdered mr. renauld.\\nthe similarity of the two cases proves that beyond a doubt.”\\n\\n“then you consider that madame beroldy was wrongly acquitted? that in\\nactual fact she was guilty of connivance in her husband’s murder?”\\n\\ni opened my eyes wide.\\n\\n“but of course! don’t you?”\\n\\npoirot walked to the end of the room, absentmindedly straightened a\\nchair, and then said thoughtfully.\\n\\n“yes, that is my opinion. but there is no ‘of course’ about it, my\\nfriend. technically speaking, madame beroldy is innocent.”\\n\\n“of that crime, perhaps. but not of this.”\\n\\npoirot sat down again, and regarded me, his thoughtful air more marked\\nthan ever.\\n\\n“so it is definitely your opinion, hastings, that madame daubreuil\\nmurdered m. renauld?”\\n\\n“yes.”\\n\\n“why?”\\n\\nhe shot the question at me with such suddenness that i was taken aback.\\n\\n“why?” i stammered. “why? oh, because—” i came to a stop.\\n\\npoirot nodded his head at me.\\n\\n“you see, you come to a stumbling-block at once. why should madame\\ndaubreuil (i shall call her that for clearness sake) murder m. renauld?\\nwe can find no shadow of a motive. she does not benefit by his death;\\nconsidered as either mistress or blackmailer she stands to lose. you\\ncannot have a murder without a motive. the first crime was different,\\nthere we had a rich lover waiting to step into her husband’s shoes.”\\n\\n“money is not the only motive for murder,” i objected.\\n\\n“true,” agreed poirot placidly. “there are two others, the _crime\\npassionnel___ is one. and there is the third rare motive, murder for an\\nidea which implies some form of mental derangement on the part of the\\nmurderer. homicidal mania, and religious fanaticism belong to that\\nclass. we can rule it out here.”\\n\\n“but what about the _crime passionnel?___ can you rule that out? if\\nmadame daubreuil was renauld’s mistress, if she found that his\\naffection was cooling, or if her jealousy was aroused in any way, might\\nshe not have struck him down in a moment of anger?”\\n\\npoirot shook his head.\\n\\n“if—i say _if___, you note—madame daubreuil was renauld’s mistress, he\\nhad not had time to tire of her. and in any case you mistake her\\ncharacter. she is a woman who can simulate great emotional stress. she\\nis a magnificent actress. but, looked at dispassionately, her life\\ndisproves her appearance. throughout, if we examine it, she had been\\ncold-blooded and calculating in her motives and actions. it was not to\\nlink her life with that of her young lover that she connived at her\\nhusband’s murder. the rich american, for whom she probably did not care\\na button, was her objective. if she committed a crime, she would always\\ndo so for gain. here there was no gain. besides, how do you account for\\nthe digging of the grave? that was a man’s work.”\\n\\n“she might have had an accomplice,” i suggested, unwilling to\\nrelinquish my belief.\\n\\n“i pass to another objection. you have spoken of the similarity between\\nthe two crimes. wherein does that lie, my friend?”\\n\\ni stared at him in astonishment.\\n\\n“why, poirot, it was you who remarked on that! the story of the masked\\nmen, the ‘secret,’ the papers!”\\n\\npoirot smiled a little.\\n\\n“do not be so indignant, i beg of you. i repudiate nothing. the\\nsimilarity of the two stories links the two cases together inevitably.\\nbut reflect now on something very curious. it is not madame daubreuil\\nwho tells us this tale—if it were all would indeed be plain sailing—it\\nis madame renauld. is she then in league with the other?”\\n\\n“i can’t believe that,” i said slowly. “if it is so, she must be the\\nmost consummate actress the world has ever known.”\\n\\n“ta-ta-ta,” said poirot impatiently. “again you have the sentiment, and\\nnot the logic! if it is necessary for a criminal to be a consummate\\nactress, then by all means assume her to be one. but is it necessary? i\\ndo not believe madame renauld to be in league with madame daubreuil for\\nseveral reasons, some of which i have already enumerated to you. the\\nothers are self-evident. therefore, that possibility eliminated, we\\ndraw very near to the truth which is, as always, very curious and\\ninteresting.”\\n\\n“poirot,” i cried, “what more do you know?”\\n\\n“_mon ami___, you must make your own deductions. you have ‘access to\\nthe facts!’ concentrate your grey cells. reason—not like giraud—but\\nlike hercule poirot.”\\n\\n“but are you _sure?___”\\n\\n“my friend, in many ways i have been an imbecile. but at last i see\\nclearly.”\\n\\n“you know everything?”\\n\\n“i have discovered what m. renauld sent for me to discover.”\\n\\n“and you know the murderer?”\\n\\n“i know one murderer.”\\n\\n“what do you mean?”\\n\\n“we talk a little at cross-purposes. there are here not one crime, but\\ntwo. the first i have solved, the second—_eh bien___, i will confess, i\\nam not sure!”\\n\\n“but, poirot, i thought you said the man in the shed had died a natural\\ndeath?”\\n\\n“ta-ta-ta.” poirot made his favourite ejaculation of impatience. “still\\nyou do not understand. one may have a crime without a murderer, but for\\ntwo crimes it is essential to have two bodies.”\\n\\nhis remark struck me as so peculiarly lacking in lucidity that i looked\\nat him in some anxiety. but he appeared perfectly normal. suddenly he\\nrose and strolled to the window.\\n\\n“here he is,” he observed.\\n\\n“who?”\\n\\n“m. jack renauld. i sent a note up to the villa to ask him to come\\nhere.”\\n\\nthat changed the course of my ideas, and i asked poirot if he knew that\\njack renauld had been in merlinville on the night of the crime. i had\\nhoped to catch my astute little friend napping, but as usual, he was\\nomniscient. he, too, had inquired at the station.\\n\\n“and without doubt we are not original in the idea, hastings. the\\nexcellent giraud, he also has probably made his inquiries.”\\n\\n“you don’t think—” i said, and then stopped. “ah, no, it would be too\\nhorrible!”\\n\\npoirot looked inquiringly at me, but i said no more. it had just\\noccurred to me that though there were seven women directly or\\nindirectly connected with the case mrs. renauld, madame daubreuil and\\nher daughter, the mysterious visitor, and the three servants—there was,\\nwith the exception of old auguste who could hardly count, only one\\nman—jack renauld. _and a man must have dug a grave.\\u200a…___\\n\\ni had no time to develop further the appalling idea that had occurred\\nto me, for jack renauld was ushered into the room.\\n\\npoirot greeted him in a business-like manner.\\n\\n“take a seat, monsieur. i regret infinitely to derange you, but you\\nwill perhaps understand that the atmosphere of the villa is not too\\ncongenial to me. m. giraud and i do not see eye to eye about\\neverything. his politeness to me has not been striking and you will\\ncomprehend that i do not intend any little discoveries i may make to\\nbenefit him in any way.”\\n\\n“exactly, m. poirot,” said the lad. “that fellow giraud is an\\nill-conditioned brute, and i’d be delighted to see some one score at\\nhis expense.”\\n\\n“then i may ask a little favour of you?”\\n\\n“certainly.”\\n\\n“i will ask you to go to the railway station and take a train to the\\nnext station along the line, abbalac. ask there at the cloak-room\\nwhether two foreigners deposited a valise there on the night of the\\nmurder. it is a small station, and they are almost certain to remember.\\nwill you do this?”\\n\\n“of course i will,” said the boy, mystified, though ready for the task.\\n\\n“i and my friend, you comprehend, have business elsewhere,” explained\\npoirot. “there is a train in a quarter of an hour, and i will ask you\\nnot to return to the villa, as i have no wish for giraud to get an\\ninkling of your errand.”\\n\\n“very well, i will go straight to the station.”\\n\\nhe rose to his feet. poirot’s voice stopped him.\\n\\n“one moment, m. renauld, there is one little matter that puzzles me.\\nwhy did you not mention to m. hautet this morning that you were in\\nmerlinville on the night of the crime?”\\n\\njack renauld’s face went crimson. with an effort he controlled himself.\\n\\n“you have made a mistake. i was in cherbourg, as i told the examining\\nmagistrate this morning.”\\n\\npoirot looked at him, his eyes narrowed, cat-like, until they only\\nshowed a gleam of green.\\n\\n“then it is a singular mistake that i have made there—for it is shared\\nby the station staff. they say you arrived by the 11:40 train.”\\n\\nfor a moment jack renauld hesitated, then he made up his mind.\\n\\n“and if i did? i suppose you do not mean to accuse me of participating\\nin my father’s murder?” he asked the question haughtily, his head\\nthrown back.\\n\\n“i should like an explanation of the reason that brought you here.”\\n\\n“that is simple enough. i came to see my fiancée, mademoiselle\\ndaubreuil. i was on the eve of a long voyage, uncertain as to when i\\nshould return. i wished to see her before i went, to assure her of my\\nunchanging devotion.”\\n\\n“and you did see her?” poirot’s eyes never left the other’s face.\\n\\nthere was an appreciable pause before renauld replied. then he said:\\n\\n“yes.”\\n\\n“and afterwards?”\\n\\n“i found i had missed the last train. i walked to st. beauvais where i\\nknocked up a garage and got a car to take me back to cherbourg.”\\n\\n“st. beauvais? that is fifteen kilometres. a long walk, m. renauld.”\\n\\n“i—i felt like walking.”\\n\\npoirot bowed his head as a sign that he accepted the explanation. jack\\nrenauld took up his hat and cane and departed. in a trice poirot jumped\\nto his feet.\\n\\n“quick, hastings. we will go after him.”\\n\\nkeeping a discreet distance behind our quarry, we followed him through\\nthe streets of merlinville. but when poirot saw that he took the\\nturning to the station, he checked himself.\\n\\n“all is well. he has taken the bait. he will go to abbalac, and will\\ninquire for the mythical valise left by the mythical foreigners. yes,\\n_mon ami___, all that was a little invention of my own.”\\n\\n“you wanted him out of the way!” i exclaimed.\\n\\n“your penetration is amazing, hastings! now, if you please, we will go\\nup to the villa geneviève.”\\n\\n\\n\\n18 giraud acts\\n\\n“by the way, poirot,” i said, as we walked along the hot white road,\\n“i’ve got a bone to pick with you. i dare say you meant well, but\\nreally it was no business of yours to go mouching round to the hôtel du\\nphare without letting me know.”\\n\\npoirot shot a quick sidelong glance at me.\\n\\n“and how did you know i had been there?” he inquired.\\n\\nmuch to my annoyance i felt the colour rising in my cheeks.\\n\\n“i happened to look in in passing,” i explained with as much dignity as\\ni could muster.\\n\\ni rather feared poirot’s banter, but to my relief, and somewhat to my\\nsurprise, he only shook his head with a rather unusual gravity.\\n\\n“if i have offended your susceptibilities in any way, i demand pardon\\nof you. you will understand better soon. but, believe me, i have\\nstriven to concentrate all my energies on the case.”\\n\\n“oh, it’s all right,” i said, mollified by the apology. “i know it’s\\nonly that you have my interests at heart. but i can take care of myself\\nall right.”\\n\\npoirot seemed to be about to say something further, but checked\\nhimself.\\n\\narrived at the villa, poirot led the way up to the shed where the\\nsecond body had been discovered. he did not, however, go in, but paused\\nby the bench which i have mentioned before as being set some few yards\\naway from it. after contemplating it for a moment or two, he paced\\ncarefully from it to the hedge which marked the boundary between the\\nvilla geneviève and the villa marguerite. then he paced back again,\\nnodding his head as he did so. returning again to the hedge, he parted\\nthe bushes with his hands.\\n\\n“with good fortune,” he remarked to me over his shoulder, “mademoiselle\\nmarthe may find herself in the garden. i desire to speak to her and\\nwould prefer not to call formally at the villa marguerite. ah, all is\\nwell, there she is. pst, mademoiselle! pst! _un moment, s’il vous\\nplaît.___”\\n\\ni joined him at the moment that marthe daubreuil, looking slightly\\nstartled, came running up to the hedge at his call.\\n\\n“a little word with you, mademoiselle, if it is permitted?”\\n\\n“certainly, monsieur poirot.”\\n\\ndespite her acquiescence, her eyes looked troubled and afraid.\\n\\n“mademoiselle, do you remember running after me on the road the day\\nthat i came to your house with the examining magistrate? you asked me\\nif any one were suspected of the crime.”\\n\\n“and you told me two chilians.” her voice sounded rather breathless,\\nand her left hand stole to her breast.\\n\\n“will you ask me the same question again, mademoiselle?”\\n\\n“what do you mean?”\\n\\n“this. if you were to ask me that question again, i should give you a\\ndifferent answer. some one is suspected—but not a chilian.”\\n\\n“who?” the word came faintly between her parted lips.\\n\\n“m. jack renauld.”\\n\\n“what?” it was a cry. “jack? impossible. who dares to suspect him?”\\n\\n“giraud.”\\n\\n“giraud!” the girl’s face was ashy. “i am afraid of that man. he is\\ncruel. he will—he will—” she broke off. there was courage gathering in\\nher face, and determination. i realized in that moment that she was a\\nfighter. poirot, too, watched her intently.\\n\\n“you know, of course, that he was here on the night of the murder?” he\\nasked.\\n\\n“yes,” she replied mechanically. “he told me.”\\n\\n“it was unwise to have tried to conceal the fact,” ventured poirot.\\n\\n“yes, yes,” she replied impatiently. “but we cannot waste time on\\nregrets. we must find something to save him. he is innocent, of course,\\nbut that will not help him with a man like giraud who has his\\nreputation to think of. he must arrest some one, and that some one will\\nbe jack.”\\n\\n“the facts will tell against him,” said poirot. “you realize that?”\\n\\nshe faced him squarely, and used the words i had heard her say in her\\nmother’s drawing-room.\\n\\n“i am not a child, monsieur. i can be brave and look facts in the face.\\nhe is innocent, and we must save him.”\\n\\nshe spoke with a kind of desperate energy, then was silent, frowning as\\nshe thought.\\n\\n“mademoiselle,” said poirot observing her keenly, “is there not\\nsomething that you are keeping back that you could tell us?”\\n\\nshe nodded perplexedly.\\n\\n“yes, there is something, but i hardly know whether you will believe\\nit—it seems so absurd.”\\n\\n“at any rate, tell us, mademoiselle.”\\n\\n“it is this. m. giraud sent for me, as an afterthought, to see if i\\ncould identify the man in there.” she signed with her head towards the\\nshed. “i could not. at least i could not at the moment. but since i\\nhave been thinking—”\\n\\n“well?”\\n\\n“it seems so queer, and yet i am almost sure. i will tell you. on the\\nmorning of the day m. renauld was murdered, i was walking in the garden\\nhere, when i heard a sound of men’s voices quarrelling. i pushed aside\\nthe bushes and looked through. one of the men was m. renauld and the\\nother was a tramp, a dreadful looking creature in filthy rags. he was\\nalternately whining and threatening. i gathered he was asking for\\nmoney, but at that moment _maman___ called me from the house, and i had\\nto go. that is all, only—i am almost sure that the tramp and the dead\\nman in the shed are one and the same.”\\n\\npoirot uttered an exclamation.\\n\\n“but why did you not say so at the time, mademoiselle?”\\n\\n“because at first it only struck me that the face was vaguely familiar\\nin some way. the man was differently dressed, and apparently belonged\\nto a superior station in life. but tell me, monsieur poirot, is it not\\npossible that this tramp might have attacked and killed m. renauld, and\\ntaken his clothes and money?”\\n\\n“it is an idea, mademoiselle,” said poirot slowly. “it leaves a lot\\nunexplained, but it is certainly an idea. i will think of it.”\\n\\na voice called from the house.\\n\\n“_maman___,” whispered marthe, “i must go.” and she slipped away\\nthrough the trees.\\n\\n“come,” said poirot, and taking my arm, turned in the direction of the\\nvilla.\\n\\n“what do you really think?” i asked, in some curiosity. “was that story\\ntrue, or did the girl make it up in order to divert suspicion from her\\nlover?”\\n\\n“it is a curious tale,” said poirot, “but i believe it to be the\\nabsolute truth. unwittingly, mademoiselle marthe told us the truth on\\nanother point—and incidentally gave jack renauld the lie. did you\\nnotice his hesitation when i asked him if he saw marthe daubreuil on\\nthe night of the crime? he paused and then said ‘yes.’ i suspected that\\nhe was lying. it was necessary for me to see mademoiselle marthe before\\nhe could put her on her guard. three little words gave me the\\ninformation i wanted. when i asked her if she knew that jack renauld\\nwas here that night, she answered ‘he _told___ me.’ now, hastings, what\\nwas jack renauld doing here on that eventful evening, and if he did not\\nsee mademoiselle marthe whom did he see?”\\n\\n“surely, poirot,” i cried, aghast, “you cannot believe that a boy like\\nthat would murder his own father.”\\n\\n“_mon ami___,” said poirot, “you continue to be of a sentimentality\\nunbelievable! i have seen mothers who murdered their little children\\nfor the sake of the insurance money! after that, one can believe\\nanything.”\\n\\n“and the motive?”\\n\\n“money of course. remember that jack renauld thought that he would come\\nin to half his father’s fortune at the latter’s death.”\\n\\n“but the tramp. where does he come in?”\\n\\npoirot shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n“giraud would say that he was an accomplice—an apache who helped young\\nrenauld to commit the crime, and who was conveniently put out of the\\nway afterwards.”\\n\\n“but the hair round the dagger? the woman’s hair?”\\n\\n“ah,” said poirot, smiling broadly. “that is the cream of giraud’s\\nlittle jest. according to him, it is not a woman’s hair at all.\\nremember that the youths of today wear their hair brushed straight back\\nfrom the forehead with pomade or hairwash to make it lie flat.\\nconsequently some of the hairs are of considerable length.”\\n\\n“and you believe that too?”\\n\\n“no,” said poirot with a curious smile. “for i know it to be the hair\\nof a woman—and more, which woman!”\\n\\n“madame daubreuil,” i announced positively.\\n\\n“perhaps,” said poirot, regarding me quizzically.\\n\\nbut i refused to allow myself to get annoyed.\\n\\n“what are we going to do now?” i asked, as we entered the hall of the\\nvilla geneviève.\\n\\n“i wish to make a search amongst the effects of m. jack renauld. that\\nis why i had to get him out of the way for a few hours.”\\n\\n“but will not giraud have searched already?” i asked doubtfully.\\n\\n“of course. he builds a case, as a beaver builds a dam, with a\\nfatiguing industry. but he will not have looked for the things that i\\nam seeking—in all probability he would not have seen their importance\\nif they stared him in the face. let us begin.”\\n\\nneatly and methodically, poirot opened each drawer in turn, examined\\nthe contents, and returned them exactly to their places. it was a\\nsingularly dull and uninteresting proceeding. poirot waded on through\\ncollars, pajamas and socks. a purring noise outside drew me to the\\nwindow. instantly i became galvanized into life.\\n\\n“poirot!” i cried. “a car has just driven up. giraud is in it, and jack\\nrenauld, and two gendarmes.”\\n\\n“_sacré tonnerre!___” growled poirot. “that animal of a giraud, could\\nhe not wait? i shall not be able to replace the things in this last\\ndrawer with the proper method. let us be quick.”\\n\\nunceremoniously he tumbled out the things on the floor, mostly ties and\\nhandkerchiefs. suddenly with a cry of triumph poirot pounced on\\nsomething, a small square cardboard, evidently a photograph. thrusting\\nit into his pocket, he returned the things pell-mell to the drawer, and\\nseizing me by the arm dragged me out of the room and down the stairs.\\nin the hall stood giraud, contemplating his prisoner.\\n\\n“good afternoon, m. giraud,” said poirot. “what have we here?”\\n\\ngiraud nodded his head towards jack.\\n\\n“he was trying to make a getaway, but i was too sharp for him. he is\\nunder arrest for the murder of his father, m. paul renauld.”\\n\\npoirot wheeled to confront the boy who leaned limply against the door,\\nhis face ashy pale.\\n\\n“what do you say to that, _jeune homme?___”\\n\\njack renauld stared at him stonily.\\n\\n“nothing,” he said.\\n\\n\\n\\n19 i use my grey cells\\n\\ni was dumbfounded. up to the last, i had not been able bring myself to\\nbelieve jack renauld guilty. i had expected a ringing proclamation of\\nhis innocence when poirot challenged him. but now, watching him as he\\nstood, white and limp against the wall, and hearing the damning\\nadmission fall from his lips, i doubted no longer.\\n\\nbut poirot had turned to giraud.\\n\\n“what are your grounds for arresting him?”\\n\\n“do you expect me to give them to you?”\\n\\n“as a matter of courtesy, yes.”\\n\\ngiraud looked at him doubtfully. he was torn between a desire to refuse\\nrudely and the pleasure of triumphing over his adversary.\\n\\n“you think i have made a mistake, i suppose?” he sneered.\\n\\n“it would not surprise me,” replied poirot, with a soupçon of malice.\\n\\ngiraud’s face took on a deeper tinge of red.\\n\\n“_eh bien___, come in here. you shall judge for yourself.” he flung\\nopen the door of the _salon___, and we passed in, leaving jack renauld\\nin the care of the two other men.\\n\\n“now, m. poirot,” said giraud laying his hat on the table, and speaking\\nwith the utmost sarcasm, “i will treat you to a little lecture on\\ndetective work. i will show you how we moderns work.”\\n\\n“_bien!___” said poirot, composing himself to listen. “i will show you\\nhow admirably the old guard can listen,” and he leaned back and closed\\nhis eyes, opening them for a moment to remark. “do not fear that i\\nshall sleep. i will attend most carefully.”\\n\\n“of course,” began giraud, “i soon saw through all that chilian\\ntomfoolery. two men were in it—but they were not mysterious foreigners!\\nall that was a blind.”\\n\\n“very creditable so far, my dear giraud,” murmured poirot. “especially\\nafter that clever trick of theirs with the match and cigarette end.”\\n\\ngiraud glared, but continued:\\n\\n“a man must have been connected with the case, in order to dig the\\ngrave. there is no man who actually benefits by the crime, but there\\nwas a man who thought he would benefit. i heard of jack renauld’s\\nquarrel with his father, and of the threats that he had used. the\\nmotive was established. now as to means. jack renauld was in\\nmerlinville that night. he concealed the fact—which turned suspicion\\ninto certainty. then we found a second victim—_stabbed with the same\\ndagger___. we know when that dagger was stolen. captain hastings here\\ncan fix the time. jack renauld, arriving from cherbourg, was the only\\nperson who could have taken it. i have accounted for all the other\\nmembers of the household.”\\n\\npoirot interrupted:\\n\\n“you are wrong. there is one other person who could have taken the\\ndagger.”\\n\\n“you refer to m. stonor? he arrived at the front door, in an automobile\\nwhich had brought him straight from calais. ah, believe me, i have\\nlooked into everything. m. jack renauld arrived by train. an hour\\nelapsed between his arrival, and the moment he presented himself at the\\nhouse. without doubt, he saw captain hastings and his companion leave\\nthe shed, slipped in himself and took the dagger, stabbed his\\naccomplice in the shed—”\\n\\n“who was already dead!”\\n\\ngiraud shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n“possibly he did not observe that. he may have judged him to be\\nsleeping. without doubt they had a rendezvous. in any case he knew this\\napparent second murder would greatly complicate the case. it did.”\\n\\n“but it could not deceive m. giraud,” murmured poirot.\\n\\n“you mock yourself at me. but i will give you one last irrefutable\\nproof. madame renauld’s story was false—a fabrication from beginning to\\nend. we believe madame renauld to have loved her husband—_yet she lied\\nto shield his murderer___. for whom will a woman lie? sometimes for\\nherself, usually for the man she loves, _always___ for her children.\\nthat is the last—the irrefutable proof. you cannot get round it.”\\n\\ngiraud paused, flushed and triumphant. poirot regarded him steadily.\\n\\n“that is my case,” said giraud. “what have you to say to it?”\\n\\n“only that there is one thing you have failed to take into account.”\\n\\n“what is that?”\\n\\n“jack renauld was presumably acquainted with the planning out of the\\ngolf course. he knew that the body would be discovered almost at once,\\nwhen they started to dig the bunker.”\\n\\ngiraud laughed out loud.\\n\\n“but it is idiotic what you say there! he wanted the body to be found!\\nuntil it was found, he could not presume death, and would have been\\nunable to enter into his inheritance.”\\n\\ni saw a quick flash of green in poirot’s eyes as he rose to his feet.\\n\\n“then why bury it?” he asked softly. “reflect, giraud. since it was to\\njack renauld’s advantage that the body should be found without delay,\\n_why dig a grave at all?___”\\n\\ngiraud did not reply. the question found him unprepared. he shrugged\\nhis shoulders as though to intimate that it was of no importance.\\n\\npoirot moved towards the door. i followed him.\\n\\n“there is one more thing that you have failed to take into account,” he\\nsaid over his shoulder.\\n\\n“what is that?”\\n\\n“the piece of lead piping,” said poirot, and left the room.\\n\\njack renauld still stood in the hall, with a white dumb face, but as we\\ncame out of the _salon___, he looked up sharply. at the same moment\\nthere was the sound of a footfall on the staircase. mrs. renauld was\\ndescending it. at the sight of her son, standing between the two\\nmyrmidons of the law, she stopped as though petrified.\\n\\n“jack,” she faltered. “jack, what is this?”\\n\\nhe looked up at her, his face set.\\n\\n“they have arrested me, mother.”\\n\\n“what?”\\n\\nshe uttered a piercing cry, and before any one could get to her swayed\\nand fell heavily. we both ran to her and lifted her up. in a minute\\npoirot stood up again.\\n\\n“she has cut her head badly, on the corner of the stairs. i fancy there\\nis a slight concussion also. if giraud wants a statement from her, he\\nwill have to wait. she will probably be unconscious for at least a\\nweek.”\\n\\ndenise and françoise had run to their mistress, and leaving her in\\ntheir charge poirot left the house. he walked with his head bent down,\\nfrowning thoughtfully at the ground. for some time i did not speak, but\\nat last i ventured to put a question to him.\\n\\n“do you believe then, in spite of all appearances to the contrary, that\\njack renauld may not be guilty?”\\n\\npoirot did not answer at once, but after a long wait he said gravely:\\n\\n“i do not know, hastings. there is just a chance of it. of course\\ngiraud is all wrong—wrong from beginning to end. if jack renauld is\\nguilty, it is in spite of giraud’s arguments, not _because___ of them.\\nand the gravest indictment against him is known only to me.”\\n\\n“what is that?” i asked, impressed.\\n\\n“if you would use your grey cells, and see the whole case clearly as i\\ndo, you too would perceive it, my friend.”\\n\\nthis was what i called one of poirot’s irritating answers. he went on,\\nwithout waiting for me to speak.\\n\\n“let us walk this way to the sea. we will sit on that little mound\\nthere, overlooking the beach, and review the case. you shall know all\\nthat i know, but i would prefer that you should come at the truth by\\nyour own efforts—not by my leading you by the hand.”\\n\\nwe established ourselves on the grassy knoll as poirot had suggested,\\nlooking out to sea. from farther along the sand, the cries of the\\nbathers reached us faintly. the sea was of the palest blue, and the\\nhalcyon calm reminded me of the day we had arrived at merlinville, my\\nown good spirits, and poirot’s suggestion that i was “fey.” what a long\\ntime seemed to have elapsed since then. and in reality it was only\\nthree days!\\n\\n“think, my friend,” said poirot’s voice encouragingly. “arrange your\\nideas. be methodical. be orderly. there is the secret of success.”\\n\\ni endeavoured to obey him, casting my mind back over all the details of\\nthe case. and reluctantly it seemed to me that the only clear and\\npossible solution was that of giraud—which poirot despised. i reflected\\nanew. if there was daylight anywhere it was in the direction of madame\\ndaubreuil. giraud was ignorant of her connection with the beroldy case.\\npoirot had declared the beroldy case to be all important. it was there\\ni must seek. i was on the right track now. and suddenly i started as an\\nidea of bewildering luminosity shot into my brain. trembling i built up\\nmy hypothesis.\\n\\n“you have a little idea, i see, _mon ami!___ capital. we progress.”\\n\\ni sat up, and lit a pipe.\\n\\n“poirot,” i said, “it seems to me we have been strangely remiss. i say\\nwe—although i dare say _i___ would be nearer the mark. but you must pay\\nthe penalty of your determined secrecy. so i say again we have been\\nstrangely remiss. there is some one we have forgotten.”\\n\\n“and who is that?” inquired poirot, with twinkling eyes.\\n\\n“georges conneau!”\\n\\n\\n\\n20 an amazing statement\\n\\nthe next moment poirot embraced me warmly. “_enfin!___ you have\\narrived. and all by yourself. it is superb! continue your reasoning.\\nyou are right. decidedly we have done wrong to forget georges conneau.”\\n\\ni was so flattered by the little man’s approval that i could hardly\\ncontinue. but at last i collected my thoughts and went on.\\n\\n“georges conneau disappeared twenty years ago, but we have no reason to\\nbelieve that he is dead.”\\n\\n“_aucunement___,” agreed poirot. “proceed.”\\n\\n“therefore we will assume that he is alive.”\\n\\n“exactly.”\\n\\n“or that he was alive until recently.”\\n\\n“_de mieux en mieux!___”\\n\\n“we will presume,” i continued, my enthusiasm rising, “that he has\\nfallen on evil days. he has become a criminal, an apache, a tramp—a\\nwhat you will. he chances to come to merlinville. there he finds the\\nwoman he has never ceased to love.”\\n\\n“eh eh! the sentimentality,” warned poirot.\\n\\n“where one hates one also loves,” i quoted or misquoted. “at any rate\\nhe finds her there, living under an assumed name. but she has a new\\nlover, the englishman, renauld. georges conneau, the memory of old\\nwrongs rising in him, quarrels with this renauld. he lies in wait for\\nhim as he comes to visit his mistress, and stabs him in the back. then,\\nterrified at what he has done, he starts to dig a grave. i imagine it\\nlikely that madame daubreuil comes out to look for her lover. she and\\nconneau have a terrible scene. he drags her into the shed, and there\\nsuddenly falls down in an epileptic fit. now supposing jack renauld to\\nappear. madame daubreuil tells him all, points out to him the dreadful\\nconsequences to her daughter if this scandal of the past is revived.\\nhis father’s murderer is dead—let them do their best to hush it up.\\njack renauld consents—goes to the house and has an interview with his\\nmother, winning her over to his point of view. primed with the story\\nthat madame daubreuil has suggested to him, she permits herself to be\\ngagged and bound. there, poirot, what do you think of that?” i leaned\\nback, flushed with the pride of successful reconstruction.\\n\\npoirot looked at me thoughtfully.\\n\\n“i think that you should write for the kinema, _mon ami___,” he\\nremarked at last.\\n\\n“you mean—?”\\n\\n“it would make a good film, the story that you have recounted to me\\nthere—but it bears no sort of resemblance to everyday life.”\\n\\n“i admit that i haven’t gone into all the details, but—”\\n\\n“you have gone further—you have ignored them magnificently. what about\\nthe way the two men were dressed? do you suggest that after stabbing\\nhis victim, conneau removed his suit of clothes, donned it himself, and\\nreplaced the dagger?”\\n\\n“i don’t see that that matters,” i objected rather huffily. “he may\\nhave obtained clothes and money from madame daubreuil by threats\\nearlier in the day.”\\n\\n“by threats—eh? you seriously advance that supposition?”\\n\\n“certainly. he could have threatened to reveal her identity to the\\nrenaulds, which would probably have put an end to all hopes of her\\ndaughter’s marriage.”\\n\\n“you are wrong, hastings. he could not blackmail her, for she had the\\nwhip hand. georges conneau, remember, is still wanted for murder. a\\nword from her and he is in danger of the guillotine.”\\n\\ni was forced, rather reluctantly, to admit the truth of this.\\n\\n“_your___ theory,” i remarked acidly, “is doubtless correct as to all\\nthe details?”\\n\\n“my theory is the truth,” said poirot quietly. “and the truth is\\nnecessarily correct. in your theory you made a fundamental error. you\\npermitted your imagination to lead you astray with midnight\\nassignations and passionate love scenes. but in investigating crime we\\nmust take our stand upon the commonplace. shall i demonstrate my\\nmethods to you?”\\n\\n“oh, by all means let us have a demonstration!”\\n\\npoirot sat very upright and began, wagging his forefinger emphatically\\nto emphasize his points.\\n\\n“i will start as you started from the basic fact of georges conneau.\\nnow the story told by madame beroldy in court as to the ‘russians’ was\\nadmittedly a fabrication. if she was innocent of connivance in the\\ncrime, it was concocted by her, and by her only as she stated. if, on\\nthe other hand, she was not innocent, it might have been invented by\\neither her or georges conneau.\\n\\n“now in this case we are investigating, we meet the same tale. as i\\npointed out to you, the facts render it very unlikely that madame\\ndaubreuil inspired it. so we turn to the hypothesis that the story had\\nits origin in the brain of georges conneau. very good. georges conneau,\\ntherefore, planned the crime with madame renauld as his accomplice. she\\nis in the limelight, and behind her is a shadowy figure whose alias is\\nunknown to us.\\n\\n“now let us go carefully over the renauld case from the beginning,\\nsetting down each significant point in its chronological order. you\\nhave a notebook and pencil? good. now what is the earliest point to\\nnote down?”\\n\\n“the letter to you?”\\n\\n“that was the first we knew of it, but it is not the proper beginning\\nof the case. the first point of any significance, i should say, is the\\nchange that came over m. renauld shortly after arriving in merlinville,\\nand which is attested to by several witnesses. we have also to consider\\nhis friendship with madame daubreuil, and the large sums of money paid\\nover to her. from thence we can come directly to the 23rd may.”\\n\\npoirot paused, cleared his throat, and signed to me to write.\\n\\n“_23rd may.___ m. renauld quarrels with his son over latter’s wish to\\nmarry marthe daubreuil. son leaves for paris.\\n\\n“_24th may.___ m. renauld alters his will, leaving entire control of\\nhis fortune in his wife’s hands.\\n\\n“_7th june.___ quarrel with tramp in garden, witnessed by marthe\\ndaubreuil.\\n\\n“letter written to m. hercule poirot, imploring assistance.\\n\\n“telegram sent to jack renauld, bidding him proceed by the _anzora___\\nto buenos ayres.\\n\\n“chauffeur, masters, sent off on a holiday.\\n\\n“visit of a lady, that evening. as he is seeing her out, his words are\\n‘yes, yes—but for god’s sake go now.\\u200a…’\\u200a”\\n\\npoirot paused.\\n\\n“there, hastings, take each of those facts one by one, consider them\\ncarefully by themselves and in relation to the whole, and see if you do\\nnot get new light on the matter.”\\n\\ni endeavoured conscientiously to do as he had said. after a moment or\\ntwo, i said rather doubtfully:\\n\\n“as to the first points, the question seems to be whether we adopt the\\ntheory of blackmail, or of an infatuation for this woman.”\\n\\n“blackmail, decidedly. you heard what stonor said as to his character\\nand habits.”\\n\\n“mrs. renauld did not confirm his view,” i argued.\\n\\n“we have already seen that madame renauld’s testimony cannot be relied\\nupon in any way. we must trust to stonor on that point.”\\n\\n“still, if renauld had an affair with a woman called bella, there seems\\nno inherent improbability in his having another with madame daubreuil.”\\n\\n“none whatever, i grant you, hastings. but did he?”\\n\\n“the letter, poirot. you forget the letter.”\\n\\n“no, i do not forget. but what makes you think that letter was written\\nto m. renauld?”\\n\\n“why it was found in his pocket and—and—”\\n\\n“and that is all!” cut in poirot. “there was no mention of any name to\\nshow to whom the letter was addressed. we assumed it was to the dead\\nman because it was in the pocket of his overcoat. now, _mon ami___,\\nsomething about that overcoat struck me as unusual. i measured it, and\\nmade the remark that he wore his overcoat very long. that remark should\\nhave given you to think.”\\n\\n“i thought you were just saying it for the sake of saying something,” i\\nconfessed.\\n\\n“ah, _quelle idée!___ later you observed me measuring the overcoat of\\nm. jack renauld. _eh bien___, m. jack renauld wears his overcoat very\\nshort. put those two facts together with a third, namely that m. jack\\nrenauld flung out of the house in a hurry on his departure for paris,\\nand tell me what you make of it!”\\n\\n“i see,” i said slowly, as the meaning of poirot’s remarks bore in upon\\nme. “that letter was written to jack renauld—not to his father. he\\ncaught up the wrong overcoat in his haste and agitation.”\\n\\npoirot nodded.\\n\\n“_précisement!___ we can return to this point later. for the moment let\\nus content ourselves with accepting the letter as having nothing to do\\nwith m. renauld _père___, and pass to the next chronological event.”\\n\\n“may 23rd,” i read, “m. renauld quarrels with his son over latter’s\\nwish to marry marthe daubreuil. son leaves for paris. i don’t see\\nanything much to remark upon there, and the altering of the will the\\nfollowing day seems straightforward enough. it was the direct result of\\nthe quarrel.”\\n\\n“we agree, _mon ami___—at least as to the cause. but what exact motive\\nunderlay this procedure of m. renauld’s?”\\n\\ni opened my eyes in surprise.\\n\\n“anger against his son of course.”\\n\\n“yet he wrote him affectionate letters to paris?”\\n\\n“so jack renauld says, but he cannot produce them.”\\n\\n“well, let us pass from that.”\\n\\n“now we come to the day of the tragedy. you have placed the events of\\nthe morning in a certain order. have you any justification for that?”\\n\\n“i have ascertained that the letter to me was posted at the same time\\nas the telegram was despatched. masters was informed he could take a\\nholiday shortly afterwards. in my opinion the quarrel with the tramp\\ntook place anterior to these happenings.”\\n\\n“i do not see that you can fix that definitely—unless you question\\nmademoiselle dabreuil again.”\\n\\n“there is no need. i am sure of it. and if you do not see that, you see\\nnothing, hastings!”\\n\\ni looked at him for a moment.\\n\\n“of course! i am an idiot. if the tramp was georges conneau, it was\\nafter the stormy interview with him that mr. renauld apprehended\\ndanger. he sent away the chauffeur, masters, whom he suspected of being\\nin the other’s pay, he wired to his son, and sent for you.”\\n\\na faint smile crossed poirot’s lips.\\n\\n“you do not think it strange that he should use exactly the same\\nexpressions in his letter as madame renauld used later in her story? if\\nthe mention of santiago was a blind, why should renauld speak of it,\\nand—what is more—send his son there?”\\n\\n“it is puzzling, i admit, but perhaps we shall find some explanation\\nlater. we come now to the evening, and the visit of the mysterious\\nlady. i confess that that fairly baffles me, unless it was madame\\ndaubreuil, as françoise all along maintained.”\\n\\npoirot shook his head.\\n\\n“my friend, my friend, where are your wits wandering? remember the\\nfragment of cheque, and the fact that the name bella duveen was faintly\\nfamiliar to stonor, and i think we may take it for granted that bella\\nduveen is the full name of jack’s unknown correspondent, and that it\\nwas she who came to the villa geneviève that night. whether she\\nintended to see jack, or whether she meant all along to appeal to his\\nfather we cannot be certain, but i think we may assume that this is\\nwhat occurred. she produced her claim upon jack, probably showed\\nletters that he had written her, and the older man tried to buy her off\\nby writing a cheque. this she indignantly tore up. the terms of her\\nletter are those of a woman genuinely in love, and she would probably\\ndeeply resent being offered money. in the end he got rid of her, and\\nhere the words that he used are significant.”\\n\\n“\\u200a‘yes, yes, but for god’s sake go now,’\\u200a” i repeated. “they seem to me\\na little vehement, perhaps, that is all.”\\n\\n“that is enough. he was desperately anxious for the girl to go. why?\\nnot only because the interview was unpleasant. no, it was the time that\\nwas slipping by, and for some reason time was precious.”\\n\\n“why should it be?” i asked, bewildered.\\n\\n“that is what we ask ourselves. why should it be? but later we have the\\nincident of the wrist watch—which again shows us that time plays a very\\nimportant part in the crime. we are now fast approaching the actual\\ndrama. it is half-past ten when bella duveen leaves, and by the\\nevidence of the wrist watch we know that the crime was committed, or at\\nany rate that it was staged, before twelve o’clock. we have reviewed\\nall the events anterior to the murder, there remains only one unplaced.\\nby the doctor’s evidence, the tramp, when found, had been dead at least\\nforty-eight hours—with a possible margin of twenty-four hours more.\\nnow, with no other facts to help me than those we have discussed, i\\nplace the death as having occurred on the morning of june 7th.”\\n\\ni stared at him, stupefied.\\n\\n“but how? why? how can you possibly know?”\\n\\n“because only in that way can the sequence of events be logically\\nexplained. _mon ami___, i have taken you step by step along the way. do\\nyou not now see what is so glaringly plain?”\\n\\n“my dear poirot, i can’t see anything glaring about it. i did think i\\nwas beginning to see my way before, but i’m now hopelessly fogged.”\\n\\npoirot looked at me sadly, and shook his head. “_mon dieu!___ but it is\\n_triste!___ a good intelligence—and so deplorably lacking in method.\\nthere is an exercise most excellent for the development of the little\\ngrey cells. i will impart it to you—”\\n\\n“for heaven’s sake, not now! you really are the most irritating of\\nfellows, poirot. for goodness’ sake, get on and tell me who killed m.\\nrenauld.”\\n\\n“that is just what i am not sure of as yet.”\\n\\n“but you said it was glaringly clear?”\\n\\n“we talk at cross-purposes, my friend. remember, it is two crimes we\\nare investigating—for which, as i pointed out to you, we have the\\nnecessary two bodies. there, there, _ne vous impatientez pas!___ i\\nexplain all. to begin with, we apply our psychology. we find three\\npoints at which m. renauld displays a distinct change of view and\\naction—three psychological points therefore. the first occurs\\nimmediately after arriving in merlinville, the second after quarrelling\\nwith his son on a certain subject, the third on the morning of june\\n7th. now for the three causes. we can attribute no. 1 to meeting madame\\ndaubreuil. no. 2 is indirectly connected with her since it concerns a\\nmarriage between m. renauld’s son and her daughter. but the cause of\\nno. 3 is hidden from us. we have to deduce it. now, _mon ami___, let me\\nask you a question; who do we believe to have planned this crime?”\\n\\n“georges conneau,” i said doubtfully, eyeing poirot warily.\\n\\n“exactly. now giraud laid it down as an axiom that a woman lies to save\\nherself, the man she loves, and her child. since we are satisfied that\\nwas georges conneau who dictated the lie to her, and as georges conneau\\nis not jack renauld, follows that the third case is put out of court.\\nand, still attributing the crime to georges conneau, the first is\\nequally so. so we are forced to the second—that madame renauld lied for\\nthe sake of the man she loved—or in other words, for the sake of\\ngeorges conneau. you agree to that.”\\n\\n“yes,” i admitted. “it seems logical enough.”\\n\\n“_bien!___ madame renauld loves georges conneau. who, then, is georges\\nconneau?”\\n\\n“the tramp.”\\n\\n“have we any evidence to show that madame renauld loved the tramp?”\\n\\n“no, but—”\\n\\n“very well then. do not cling to theories where facts no longer support\\nthem. ask yourself instead who madame renauld _did___ love.”\\n\\ni shook my head perplexed.\\n\\n“_mais, oui___, you know perfectly. who did madame renauld love so\\ndearly that when she saw his dead body, she fell down in a swoon?”\\n\\ni stared dumbfounded.\\n\\n“her husband?” i gasped.\\n\\npoirot nodded.\\n\\n“her husband—or georges conneau, whichever you like to call him.”\\n\\ni rallied myself.\\n\\n“but it’s impossible.”\\n\\n“how ‘impossible?’ did we not agree just now that madame daubreuil was\\nin a position to blackmail georges conneau?”\\n\\n“yes, but—”\\n\\n“and did she not very effectively blackmail m. renauld?”\\n\\n“that may be true enough, but—”\\n\\n“and is it not a fact that we know nothing of m. renauld’s youth and\\nupbringing? that he springs suddenly into existence as a french\\ncanadian exactly twenty-two years ago?”\\n\\n“all that is so,” i said more firmly, “but you seem to me to be\\noverlooking one salient point.”\\n\\n“what is it, my friend?”\\n\\n“why, we have admitted georges conneau planned the crime. that brings\\nus to the ridiculous statement that he planned his own murder!”\\n\\n“_eh bien, mon ami___,” said poirot placidly, “that is just what he did\\ndo!”\\n\\n\\n\\n21 hercule poirot on the case!\\n\\nin a measured voice, poirot began his exposition.\\n\\n“it seems strange to you, _mon ami___, that a man should plan his own\\ndeath? so strange, that you prefer to reject the truth as fantastic,\\nand to revert to a story that is in reality ten times more impossible.\\nyes, m. renauld planned his own death, but there is one detail that\\nperhaps escapes you—he did not intend to die.”\\n\\ni shook my head, bewildered.\\n\\n“but no, it is all most simple really,” said poirot kindly. “for the\\ncrime that m. renauld proposed a murderer was not necessary, as i told\\nyou, but a body was. let us reconstruct, seeing events this time from a\\ndifferent angle.\\n\\n“georges conneau flies from justice—to canada. there, under an assumed\\nname he marries, and finally acquires a vast fortune in south america.\\nbut there is a nostalgia upon him for his own country. twenty years\\nhave elapsed, he is considerably changed in appearance, besides being a\\nman of such eminence that no one is likely to connect him with a\\nfugitive from justice many years ago. he deems it quite safe to return.\\nhe takes up his headquarters in england, but intends to spend the\\nsummers in france. and ill fortune, that obscure justice which shapes\\nmen’s ends, and will not allow them to evade the consequences of their\\nacts, takes him to merlinville. there, in the whole of france, is the\\none person who is capable of recognizing him. it is, of course, a gold\\nmine to madame daubreuil, and a gold mine of which she is not slow to\\ntake advantage. he is helpless, absolutely in her power. and she bleeds\\nhim heavily.\\n\\n“and then the inevitable happens. jack renauld falls in love with the\\nbeautiful girl he sees almost daily, and wishes to marry her. that\\nrouses his father. at all costs, he will prevent his son marrying the\\ndaughter of this evil woman. jack renauld knows nothing of his father’s\\npast, but madame renauld knows everything. she is a woman of great\\nforce of character, and passionately devoted to her husband. they take\\ncounsel together. renauld sees only one way of escape—death. he must\\nappear to die, in reality escaping to another country where he will\\nstart again under an assumed name, and where madame renauld, having\\nplayed the widow’s part for a while, can join him. it is essential that\\nshe should have control of the money, so he alters his will. how they\\nmeant to manage the body business originally, i do not know—possibly an\\nart student’s skeleton—and a fire or something of the kind, but long\\nbefore their plans have matured an event occurs which plays into their\\nhands. a rough tramp, violent and abusive, finds his way into the\\ngarden. there is a struggle, m. renauld seeks to eject him, and\\nsuddenly the tramp, an epileptic, falls down in a fit. he is dead. m.\\nrenauld calls his wife. together they drag him into the shed—as we\\nknow, the event had occurred just outside—and they realize the\\nmarvellous opportunity that has been vouchsafed them. the man bears no\\nresemblance to m. renauld, but he is middle-aged, of a usual french\\ntype. that is sufficient.\\n\\n“i rather fancy that they sat on the bench up there, out of earshot\\nfrom the house, discussing matters. their plan was quickly made. the\\nidentification must rest solely on madame renauld’s evidence. jack\\nrenauld and the chauffeur (who had been with his master two years) must\\nbe got out of the way. it was unlikely that the french women servants\\nwould go near the body, and in any case renauld intended to take\\nmeasures to deceive any one not likely to appreciate details. masters\\nwas sent off, a telegram despatched to jack, buenos ayres being\\nselected to give credence to the story that renauld had decided upon.\\nhaving heard of me, as a rather obscure elderly detective, he wrote his\\nappeal for help knowing that, when i arrived, the production of the\\nletter would have a profound effect upon the examining\\nmagistrate—which, of course, it did.\\n\\n“they dressed the body of the tramp in a suit of m. renauld’s and left\\nhis ragged coat and trousers by the door of the shed, not daring to\\ntake them into the house. and then, to give credence to the tale madame\\nrenauld was to tell, they drove the aeroplane dagger through his heart.\\nthat night, m. renauld will first bind and gag his wife, and then,\\ntaking a spade, will dig a grave in that particular spot of ground\\nwhere he knows a—how do you call it? bunkair?—is to be made. it is\\nessential that the body should be found—madame daubreuil must have no\\nsuspicions. on the other hand, if a little time elapses, any dangers as\\nto identity will be greatly lessened. then, m. renauld will don the\\ntramp’s rags, and shuffle off to the station, where he will leave,\\nunnoticed, by the 12:10 train. since the crime will be supposed to have\\ntaken place two hours later, no suspicion can possibly attach to him.\\n\\n“you see now his annoyance at the inopportune visit of the girl bella.\\nevery moment of delay is fatal to his plans. he gets rid of her as soon\\nas he can, however. then, to work! he leaves the front door slightly\\najar to create the impression that the assassins left that way. he\\nbinds and gags madame renauld, correcting his mistake of twenty-two\\nyears ago, when the looseness of the bonds caused suspicion to fall\\nupon his accomplice, but leaving her primed with essentially the same\\nstory as he had invented before, proving the unconscious recoil of the\\nmind against originality. the night is chilly, and he slips on an\\novercoat over his underclothing, intending to cast it into the grave\\nwith the dead man. he goes out by the window, smoothing over the flower\\nbed carefully, and thereby furnishing the most positive evidence\\nagainst himself. he goes out on to the lonely golf links, and he\\ndigs—and then—”\\n\\n“yes?”\\n\\n“and then,” said poirot gravely, “the justice that he has so long\\neluded overtakes him. an unknown hand stabs him in the back.\\u200a… now,\\nhastings, you understand what i mean when i talk of _two___ crimes. the\\nfirst crime, the crime that m. renauld, in his arrogance, asked us to\\ninvestigate (ah, but he made a famous mistake there! he misjudged\\nhercule poirot!) is solved. but behind it lies a deeper riddle. and to\\nsolve that will be difficult—since the criminal in his wisdom, has been\\ncontent to avail himself of the devices prepared by m. renauld. it has\\nbeen a particularly perplexing and baffling mystery to solve. a young\\nhand, like giraud, who does not place any reliance on the psychology,\\nis almost certain to fail.”\\n\\n“you’re marvellous, poirot,” i said, with admiration. “absolutely\\nmarvellous. no one on earth but you could have done it!”\\n\\ni think my praise pleased him. for once in his life, he looked almost\\nembarrassed.\\n\\n“ah, then you no longer despise poor old papa poirot? you shift your\\nallegiance back from the human foxhound?”\\n\\nhis term for giraud never failed to make me smile.\\n\\n“rather. you’ve scored over him handsomely.”\\n\\n“that poor giraud,” said poirot, trying unsuccessfully to look modest.\\n“without doubt it is not all stupidity. he has had _la mauvaise\\nchance___ once or twice. that dark hair coiled round the dagger, for\\ninstance. to say the least, it was misleading.”\\n\\n“to tell you the truth, poirot,” i said slowly, “even now i don’t quite\\nsee—whose hair was it?”\\n\\n“madame renauld’s of course. that is where _la mauvaise chance___ came\\nin. her hair, dark originally, is almost completely silvered. it might\\njust as easily have been a grey hair—and then, by no conceivable effort\\ncould giraud have persuaded himself it came from the head of jack\\nrenauld! but it is all of a piece. always the facts must be twisted to\\nfit the theory! did not giraud find the traces of two persons, a man\\nand a woman, in the shed? and how does that fit in with his\\nreconstruction of the case? i will tell you—it does not fit in, and so\\nwe shall hear no more of them! i ask you, is that a methodical way of\\nworking? the great giraud! the great giraud is nothing but a toy\\nballoon—swollen with its own importance. but i, hercule poirot, whom he\\ndespises, will be the little pin that pricks the big balloon—_comme\\nça!___” and he made an expressive gesture. then, calming down, he\\nresumed:\\n\\n“without doubt, when madame renauld recovers, she will speak. the\\npossibility of her son being accused of the murder never occurred to\\nher. how should it, when she believed him safely at sea on board the\\n_anzora?___ _ah! voilà une femme___, hastings! what force, what\\nself-command! she only made one slip. on his unexpected return: ‘it\\ndoes not matter—_now___.’ and no one noticed—no one realized the\\nsignificance of those words. what a terrible part she has had to play,\\npoor woman. imagine the shock when she goes to identify the body and,\\ninstead of what she expects, sees the actual lifeless form of the\\nhusband she has believed miles away by now. no wonder she fainted! but\\nsince then, despite her grief and her despair, how resolutely she has\\nplayed her part, and how the anguish of it must wring her. she cannot\\nsay a word to set us on the track of the real murderers. for her son’s\\nsake, no one must know that paul renauld was georges conneau, the\\ncriminal. final and most bitter blow, she has admitted publicly that\\nmadame daubreuil was her husband’s mistress—for a hint of blackmail\\nmight be fatal to her secret. how cleverly she dealt with the examining\\nmagistrate when he asked her if there was any mystery in her husband’s\\npast life. ‘nothing so romantic, i am sure, m. le juge.’ it was\\nperfect, the indulgent tone, the _soupçon___ of sad mockery. at once m.\\nhautet felt himself foolish and melodramatic. yes, she is a great\\nwoman! if she loved a criminal, she loved him royally!”\\n\\npoirot lost himself in contemplation.\\n\\n“one thing more, poirot, what about the piece of lead piping?”\\n\\n“you do not see? to disfigure the victim’s face so that it would be\\nunrecognizable. it was that which first set me on the right track. and\\nthat imbecile of a giraud, swarming all over it to look for match ends!\\ndid i not tell you that a clue of two feet long was quite as good as a\\nclue of two inches?”\\n\\n“well, giraud will sing small now,” i observed hastily, to lead the\\nconversation away from my own shortcomings.\\n\\n“as i said before, will he? if he has arrived at the right person by\\nthe wrong method, he will not permit that to worry him.”\\n\\n“but surely—” i paused as i saw the new trend of things.\\n\\n“you see, hastings, we must now start again. who killed m. renauld?\\nsome one who was near the villa just before twelve o’clock that night,\\nsome one who would benefit by his death—the description fits jack\\nrenauld only too well. the crime need not have been premeditated. and\\nthen the dagger!”\\n\\ni started, i had not realized that point.\\n\\n“of course,” i said. “the second dagger we found in the tramp was mrs.\\nrenauld’s. there _were___ two, then.”\\n\\n“certainly, and, since they were duplicates, it stands to reason that\\njack renauld was the owner. but that would not trouble me so much. in\\nfact i have a little idea as to that. no, the worst indictment against\\nhim is again psychological—heredity, _mon ami___, heredity! like\\nfather, like son—jack renauld, when all is said or done, is the son of\\ngeorges conneau.”\\n\\nhis tone was grave and earnest, and i was impressed in spite of myself.\\n\\n“what is your little idea that you mentioned just now?” i asked.\\n\\nfor answer, poirot consulted his turnip-faced watch, and then asked:\\n\\n“what time is the afternoon boat from calais?”\\n\\n“about five, i believe.”\\n\\n“that will do very well. we shall just have time.”\\n\\n“you are going to england?”\\n\\n“yes, my friend.”\\n\\n“why?”\\n\\n“to find a possible—witness.”\\n\\n“who?”\\n\\nwith a rather peculiar smile upon his face, poirot replied:\\n\\n“miss bella duveen.”\\n\\n“but how will you find her—what do you know about her?”\\n\\n“i know nothing about her—but i can guess a good deal. we may take it\\nfor granted that her name _is___ bella duveen, and since that name was\\nfaintly familiar to m. stonor, though evidently not in connection with\\nthe renauld family, it is probable that she is on the stage. jack\\nrenauld was a young man with plenty of money, and twenty years of age.\\nthe stage is sure to have been the home of his first love. it tallies,\\ntoo, with m. renauld’s attempt to placate her with a cheque. i think i\\nshall find her all right—especially with the help of _this___.”\\n\\nand he brought out the photograph i had seen him take from jack\\nrenauld’s drawer. “with love from bella,” was scrawled across the\\ncorner, but it was not that which held my eyes fascinated. the likeness\\nwas not first rate—but for all that it was unmistakable to me. i felt a\\ncold sinking, as though some unutterable calamity had befallen me.\\n\\nit was the face of cinderella.\\n\\n\\n\\n22 i find love\\n\\nfor a moment or two i sat as though frozen, the photograph still in my\\nhand. then, summoning all my courage to appear unmoved, i handed it\\nback. at the same time, i stole a quick glance at poirot. had he\\nnoticed anything? but to my relief he did not seem to be observing me.\\nanything unusual in my manner had certainly escaped him.\\n\\nhe rose briskly to his feet.\\n\\n“we have no time to lose. we must make our departure with all despatch.\\nall is well—the sea it will be calm!”\\n\\nin the bustle of departure, i had no time for thinking, but once on\\nboard the boat, secure from poirot’s observation (he, as usual, was\\n“practising the method most excellent of laverguier”) i pulled myself\\ntogether, and attacked the facts dispassionately. how much did poirot\\nknow? was he aware that my acquaintance of the train and bella duveen\\nwere one and the same? why had he gone to the hôtel du phare? on my\\nbehalf as i had believed? or had i only fatuously thought so, and was\\nthis visit undertaken with a deeper and more sinister purpose?\\n\\nbut in any case, why was he bent on finding this girl? did he suspect\\nher of having seen jack renauld commit the crime? or did he suspect—but\\nthat was impossible! the girl had no grudge against the elder renauld,\\nno possible motive for wishing his death. what had brought her back to\\nthe scene of the murder? i went over the facts carefully. she must have\\nleft the train at calais where i parted from her that day. no wonder i\\nhad been unable to find her on the boat. if she had dined in calais,\\nand then taken a train out to merlinville, she would have arrived at\\nthe villa geneviève just about the time that françoise said. what had\\nshe done when she left the house just after ten? presumably either gone\\nto an hotel, or returned to calais. and then? the crime had been\\ncommitted on tuesday night. on thursday morning, she was once more in\\nmerlinville. had she ever left france at all? i doubted it very much.\\nwhat kept her there—the hope of seeing jack renauld? i had told her (as\\nat the time we believed) that he was on the high seas _en route___ to\\nbuenos ayres. possibly she was aware that the _anzora___ had not\\nsailed. but to know that she must have seen jack. was that what poirot\\nwas after? had jack renauld, returning to see marthe daubreuil, come\\nface to face instead with bella duveen, the girl he had heartlessly\\nthrown over?\\n\\ni began to see daylight. if that were indeed the case, it might furnish\\njack with the alibi he needed. yet under those circumstances his\\nsilence seemed difficult to explain. why could he not have spoken out\\nboldly? did he fear for this former entanglement of his to come to the\\nears of marthe daubreuil? i shook my head, dissatisfied. the thing had\\nbeen harmless enough, a foolish boy and girl affair, and i reflected\\ncynically that the son of a millionaire was not likely to be thrown\\nover by a penniless french girl, who moreover loved him devotedly,\\nwithout a much graver cause.\\n\\naltogether i found the affair puzzling and unsatisfactory. i disliked\\nintensely being associated with poirot in hunting this girl down, but i\\ncould not see any way of avoiding it, without revealing everything to\\nhim, and this, for some reason, i was loath to do.\\n\\npoirot reappeared brisk and smiling at dover, and our journey to london\\nwas uneventful. it was past nine o’clock when we arrived, and i\\nsupposed that we should return straight away to our rooms and do\\nnothing till the morning. but poirot had other plans.\\n\\n“we must lose no time, _mon ami___. the news of the arrest will not be\\nin the english papers until the day after tomorrow, but still we must\\nlose no time.”\\n\\ni did not quite follow his reasoning, but i merely asked how he\\nproposed to find the girl.\\n\\n“you remember joseph aarons, the theatrical agent? no? i assisted him\\nin a little matter of a japanese wrestler. a pretty little problem, i\\nmust recount it to you one day. he, without doubt, will be able to put\\nus in the way of finding out what we want to know.”\\n\\nit took us some time to run mr. aarons to earth, and it was after\\nmidnight when we finally managed it. he greeted poirot with every\\nevidence of warmth, and professed himself ready to be of service to us\\nin any way.\\n\\n“there’s not much about the profession i don’t know,” he said, beaming\\ngenially.\\n\\n“_eh bien___, m. aarons, i desire to find a young girl called bella\\nduveen.”\\n\\n“bella duveen. i know the name, but for the moment i can’t place it.\\nwhat’s her line?”\\n\\n“that i do not know—but here is her photograph.”\\n\\nmr. aarons studied it for a moment, then his face lighted.\\n\\n“got it!” he slapped his thigh. “the dulcibella kids, by the lord!”\\n\\n“the dulcibella kids?”\\n\\n“that’s it. they’re sisters. acrobats, dancers and singers. give quite\\na good little turn. they’re in the provinces somewhere, i believe—if\\nthey’re not resting. they’ve been on in paris for the last two or three\\nweeks.”\\n\\n“can you find out for me exactly where they are?”\\n\\n“easy as a bird. you go home, and i’ll send you round the dope in the\\nmorning.”\\n\\nwith this promise we took leave of him. he was as good as his word.\\nabout eleven o’clock the following day, a scribbled note reached us.\\n\\n“the dulcibella sisters are on at the palace in coventry. good luck to\\nyou.”\\n\\nwithout more ado, we started for coventry. poirot made no inquiries at\\nthe theatre, but contented himself with booking stalls for the variety\\nperformance that evening.\\n\\nthe show was wearisome beyond words—or perhaps it was only my mood that\\nmade it seem so. japanese families balanced themselves precariously,\\nwould-be fashionable men, in greenish evening dress and exquisitely\\nslicked hair, reeled off society patter and danced marvellously, stout\\nprima donnas sang at the top of the human register, a comic comedian\\nendeavoured to be mr. george robey and failed signally.\\n\\nat last the number went up which announced the dulcibella kids. my\\nheart beat sickeningly. there she was—there they both were, the pair of\\nthem, one flaxen haired, one dark, matching as to size, with short\\nfluffy skirts and immense buster brown bows. they looked a pair of\\nextremely piquant children. they began to sing. their voices were fresh\\nand true, rather thin and music-hally, but attractive.\\n\\nit was quite a pretty little turn. they danced neatly, and did some\\nclever little acrobatic feats. the words of their songs were crisp and\\ncatchy. when the curtain fell, there was a full meed of applause.\\nevidently the dulcibella kids were a success.\\n\\nsuddenly i felt that i could remain no longer. i must get out into the\\nair. i suggested leaving to poirot.\\n\\n“go by all means, _mon ami___. i amuse myself, and will stay to the\\nend. i will rejoin you later.”\\n\\nit was only a few steps from the theatre to the hotel. i went up to the\\nsitting-room, ordered a whisky and soda, and sat drinking it, staring\\nmeditatively into the empty grate. i heard the door open, and turned my\\nhead, thinking it was poirot. then i jumped to my feet. it was\\ncinderella who stood in the doorway. she spoke haltingly, her breath\\ncoming in little gasps.\\n\\n“i saw you in front. you and your friend. when you got up to go, i was\\nwaiting outside and followed you. why are you here—in coventry? what\\nwere you doing there to-night? is the man who was with you the—the\\ndetective?”\\n\\nshe stood there, the cloak she had wrapped round her stage dress\\nslipping from her shoulders. i saw the whiteness of her cheeks under\\nthe rouge, and heard the terror in her voice. and in that moment i\\nunderstood everything—understood why poirot was seeking her, and what\\nshe feared, and understood at last my own heart.\\u200a…\\n\\n“yes,” i said gently.\\n\\n“is he looking for—me?” she half whispered.\\n\\nthen, as i did not answer for a moment, she slipped down by the big\\nchair, and burst into violent, bitter weeping.\\n\\ni knelt down by her, holding her in my arms, and smoothing the hair\\nback from her face.\\n\\n“don’t cry, child, don’t cry, for god’s sake. you’re safe here. i’ll\\ntake care of you. don’t cry, darling. don’t cry. i know—i know\\neverything.”\\n\\n“oh, but you don’t!”\\n\\n“i think i do.” and after a moment, as her sobs grew quieter, i asked:\\n“it was you who took the dagger, wasn’t it?”\\n\\n“yes.”\\n\\n“that was why you wanted me to show you round? and why you pretended to\\nfaint?”\\n\\nagain she nodded. it was a strange thought to come to me at the moment,\\nbut it shot into my mind that i was glad her motive was what it had\\nbeen—rather than the idle and morbid curiosity i had accused her of at\\nthe time. how gallantly she had played her part that day, inwardly\\nracked with fear and trepidation as she must have been. poor little\\nsoul, bearing the burden of a moment’s impetuous action.\\n\\n“why did you take the dagger?” i asked presently.\\n\\nshe replied as simply as a child:\\n\\n“i was afraid there might be finger-marks on it.”\\n\\n“but didn’t you remember that you had worn gloves?”\\n\\nshe shook her head as though bewildered, and then said slowly:\\n\\n“are you going to give me up to—to the police?”\\n\\n“good god! no.”\\n\\nher eyes sought mine long and earnestly, and then she asked in a little\\nquiet voice that sounded afraid of itself:\\n\\n“why not?”\\n\\nit seemed a strange place and a strange time for a declaration of\\nlove—and god knows, in all my imagining, i had never pictured love\\ncoming to me in such a guise. but i answered simply and naturally\\nenough:\\n\\n“because i love you, cinderella.”\\n\\nshe bent her head down, as though ashamed, and muttered in a broken\\nvoice:\\n\\n“you can’t—you can’t—not if you knew—” and then, as though rallying\\nherself, she faced me squarely, and asked:\\n\\n“what do you know, then?”\\n\\n“i know that you came to see mr. renauld that night. he offered you a\\ncheque and you tore it up indignantly. then you left the house—” i\\npaused.\\n\\n“go on—what next?”\\n\\n“i don’t know whether you knew that jack renauld would be coming that\\nnight, or whether you just waited about on the chance of seeing him,\\nbut you did wait about. perhaps you were just miserable, and walked\\naimlessly—but at any rate just before twelve you were still near there,\\nand you saw a man on the golf links—”\\n\\nagain i paused. i had leapt to the truth in a flash as she entered the\\nroom, but now the picture rose before me even more convincingly. i saw\\nvividly the peculiar pattern of the overcoat on the dead body of mr.\\nrenauld, and i remembered the amazing likeness that had startled me\\ninto believing for one instant that the dead man had risen from the\\ndead when his son burst into our conclave in the _salon___.\\n\\n“go on,” repeated the girl steadily.\\n\\n“i fancy his back was to you—but you recognized him, or thought you\\nrecognized him. the gait and the carriage were familiar to you, and the\\npattern of his overcoat.” i paused. “you told me in the train on the\\nway from paris that you had italian blood in your veins, and that you\\nhad nearly got into trouble once with it. you used a threat in one of\\nyour letters to jack renauld. when you saw him there, your anger and\\njealousy drove you mad—and you struck! i don’t believe for a minute\\nthat you meant to kill him. but you did kill him, cinderella.”\\n\\nshe had flung up her hands to cover her face, and in a choked voice she\\nsaid:\\n\\n“you’re right\\u200a… you’re right\\u200a… i can see it all as you tell it.” then\\nshe turned on me almost savagely. “and you love me? knowing what you\\ndo, how can you love me?”\\n\\n“i don’t know,” i said a little wearily. “i think love is like that—a\\nthing one cannot help. i have tried, i know—ever since the first day i\\nmet you. and love has been too strong for me.”\\n\\nand then suddenly, when i least expected it, she broke down again,\\ncasting herself down on the floor and sobbing wildly.\\n\\n“oh, i can’t!” she cried. “i don’t know what to do. i don’t know which\\nway to turn. oh, pity me, pity me, some one, and tell me what to do!”\\n\\nagain i knelt by her, soothing her as best i could.\\n\\n“don’t be afraid of me, bella. for god’s sake don’t be afraid of me. i\\nlove you, that’s true—but i don’t want anything in return. only let me\\nhelp you. love him still if you have to, but let me help you as he\\ncan’t.”\\n\\nit was as though she had been turned to stone by my words. she raised\\nher head from her hands and stared at me.\\n\\n“you think that?” she whispered. “you think that i love jack renauld?”\\n\\nthen, half laughing, half crying, she flung her arms passionately round\\nmy neck, and pressed her sweet wet face to mine.\\n\\n“not as i love you,” she whispered. “never as i love you!”\\n\\nher lips brushed my cheek, and then, seeking my mouth, kissed me again\\nand again with a sweetness and fire beyond belief. the wildness of\\nit—and the wonder, i shall not forget—no, not as long as i live!\\n\\nit was a sound in the doorway that made us look up. poirot was standing\\nthere looking at us.\\n\\ni did not hesitate. with a bound i reached him and pinioned his arms to\\nhis sides.\\n\\n“quick,” i said to the girl. “get out of here. as fast as you can. i’ll\\nhold him.”\\n\\nwith one look at me, she fled out of the room past us. i held poirot in\\na grip of iron.\\n\\n“_mon ami___,” observed the latter mildly, “you do this sort of thing\\nvery well. the strong man holds me in his grasp and i am helpless as a\\nchild. but all this is uncomfortable and slightly ridiculous. let us\\nsit down and be calm.”\\n\\n“you won’t pursue her?”\\n\\n“_mon dieu!___ no. am i giraud? release me, my friend.”\\n\\nkeeping a suspicious eye upon him, for i paid poirot the compliment of\\nknowing that i was no match for him in astuteness, i relaxed my grip,\\nand he sank into an arm-chair, feeling his arms tenderly.\\n\\n“it is that you have the strength of a bull when you are roused,\\nhastings! _eh bien___, and do you think you have behaved well to your\\nold friend? i show you the girl’s photograph and you recognize it, but\\nyou never say a word.”\\n\\n“there was no need if you knew that i recognized it,” i said rather\\nbitterly. so poirot had known all along! i had not deceived him for an\\ninstant.\\n\\n“ta-ta! you did not know that i knew that. and tonight you help the\\ngirl to escape when we have found her with so much trouble! _eh\\nbien!___ it comes to this—are you going to work with me or against me,\\nhastings?”\\n\\nfor a moment or two i did not answer. to break with my old friend gave\\nme great pain. yet i must definitely range myself against him. would he\\never forgive me, i wondered? he had been strangely calm so far, but i\\nknew him to possess marvellous self-command.\\n\\n“poirot,” i said, “i’m sorry. i admit i’ve behaved badly to you over\\nthis. but sometimes one has no choice. and in future i must take my own\\nline.”\\n\\npoirot nodded his head several times.\\n\\n“i understand,” he said. the mocking light had quite died out of his\\neyes, and he spoke with a sincerity and kindness that surprised me. “it\\nis that, my friend, is it not? it is love that has come—not as you\\nimagined it, all cock a hoop with fine feathers, but sadly, with\\nbleeding feet. well, well—i warned you. when i realized that this girl\\nmust have taken the dagger, i warned you. perhaps you remember. but\\nalready it was too late. but, tell me, how much do you know?”\\n\\ni met his eyes squarely.\\n\\n“nothing that you could tell me would be any surprise to me, poirot.\\nunderstand that. but in case you think of resuming your search for miss\\nduveen, i should like you to know one thing clearly. if you have any\\nidea that she was concerned in the crime, or was the mysterious lady\\nwho called upon mr. renauld that night, you are wrong. i travelled home\\nfrom france with her that day, and parted from her at victoria that\\nevening so that it is clearly impossible for her to have been in\\nmerlinville.”\\n\\n“ah!” poirot looked at me thoughtfully. “and you would swear to that in\\na court of law?”\\n\\n“most certainly i would.”\\n\\npoirot rose and bowed.\\n\\n“_mon ami! vive l’amour!___ it can perform miracles. it is decidedly\\ningenious what you have thought of there. it defeats even hercule\\npoirot!”\\n\\n\\n\\n23 difficulties ahead\\n\\nafter a moment of stress, such as i have just described, reaction is\\nbound to set in. i retired to rest that night on a note of triumph, but\\ni awoke to realize that i was by no means out of the wood. true, i\\ncould see no flaw in the alibi i had so suddenly conceived. i had but\\nto stick to my story, and i failed to see how bella could be convicted\\nin face of it. it was not as though there was any old friendship\\nbetween us that could be raked up, and which might lead them to suspect\\nthat i was committing perjury. it could be proved that in actual fact i\\nhad only seen the girl on three occasions. no, i was still satisfied\\nwith my idea—had not even poirot admitted that it defeated him?\\n\\nbut there i felt the need of treading warily. all very well for my\\nlittle friend to admit himself momentarily nonplussed. i had far too\\nmuch respect for his abilities to conceive of him as being content to\\nremain in that position. i had a very humble opinion of my wits when it\\ncame to matching them against his. poirot would not take defeat lying\\ndown. somehow or other, he would endeavour to turn the tables on me,\\nand that in the way, and at the moment, when i least expected it.\\n\\nwe met at breakfast the following morning as though nothing had\\nhappened. poirot’s good temper was imperturbable, yet i thought i\\ndetected a film of reserve in his manner which was new. after\\nbreakfast, i announced my intention of going out for a stroll. a\\nmalicious gleam shot through poirot’s eyes.\\n\\n“if it is information you seek, you need not be at the pains of\\nderanging yourself. i can tell you all you wish to know. the dulcibella\\nsisters have cancelled their contract, and have left coventry for an\\nunknown destination.”\\n\\n“is that really so, poirot?”\\n\\n“you can take it from me, hastings. i made inquiries the first thing\\nthis morning. after all, what else did you expect?”\\n\\ntrue enough, nothing else could be expected under the circumstances.\\ncinderella had profited by the slight start i had been able to assure\\nher, and would certainly not lose a moment in removing herself from the\\nreach of the pursuer. it was what i had intended and planned.\\nnevertheless, i was aware of being plunged into a network of fresh\\ndifficulties.\\n\\ni had absolutely no means of communicating with the girl, and it was\\nvital that she should know the line of defence that had occurred to me,\\nand which i was prepared to carry out. of course it was possible that\\nshe might try to send word to me in some way or another, but i hardly\\nthought it likely. she would know the risk she ran of a message being\\nintercepted by poirot, thus setting him on her track once more. clearly\\nher only course was to disappear utterly for the time being.\\n\\nbut, in the meantime, what was poirot doing? i studied him attentively.\\nhe was wearing his most innocent air, and staring meditatively into the\\nfar distance. he looked altogether too placid and supine to give me\\nreassurance. i had learned, with poirot, that the less dangerous he\\nlooked, the more dangerous he was. his quiescence alarmed me. observing\\na troubled quality in my glance, he smiled benignantly.\\n\\n“you are puzzled, hastings? you ask yourself why i do not launch myself\\nin pursuit?”\\n\\n“well—something of the kind.”\\n\\n“it is what you would do, were you in my place. i understand that. but\\ni am not of those who enjoy rushing up and down a country seeking a\\nneedle in a haystack, as you english say. no—let mademoiselle bella\\nduveen go. without doubt, i shall be able to find her when the time\\ncomes. until then, i am content to wait.”\\n\\ni stared at him doubtfully. was he seeking to mislead me? i had an\\nirritating feeling that, even now, he was master of the situation. my\\nsense of superiority was gradually waning. i had contrived the girl’s\\nescape, and evolved a brilliant scheme for saving her from the\\nconsequences of her rash act—but i could not rest easy in my mind.\\npoirot’s perfect calm awakened a thousand apprehensions.\\n\\n“i suppose, poirot,” i said rather diffidently, “i mustn’t ask what\\nyour plans are? i’ve forfeited the right.”\\n\\n“but not at all. there is no secret about them. we return to france\\nwithout delay.”\\n\\n“_we?___”\\n\\n“precisely—‘_we!___’ you know very well that you cannot afford to let\\npapa poirot out of your sight. eh, is it not so, my friend? but remain\\nin england by all means if you wish—”\\n\\ni shook my head. he had hit the nail on the head. i could not afford to\\nlet him out of my sight. although i could not expect his confidence\\nafter what had happened, i could still check his actions. the only\\ndanger to bella lay with him. giraud and the french police were\\nindifferent to her existence. at all costs i must keep near poirot.\\n\\npoirot observed me attentively as these reflections passed through my\\nmind, and gave a nod of satisfaction.\\n\\n“i am right, am i not? and as you are quite capable of trying to follow\\nme, disguised with some absurdity such as a false beard—which every one\\nwould perceive, _bien entendu___—i much prefer that we should voyage\\ntogether. it would annoy me greatly that any one should mock themselves\\nat you.”\\n\\n“very well, then. but it’s only fair to warn you—”\\n\\n“i know—i know all. you are my enemy! be my enemy then. it does not\\nworry me at all.”\\n\\n“so long as it’s all fair and above-board, i don’t mind.”\\n\\n“you have to the full the english passion for ‘fair-play!’ now your\\nscruples are satisfied, let us depart immediately. there is no time to\\nbe lost. our stay in england has been short but sufficient. i know—what\\ni wanted to know.”\\n\\nthe tone was light, but i read a veiled menace into the words.\\n\\n“still—” i began, and stopped.\\n\\n“still—as you say! without doubt you are satisfied with the part you\\nare playing. me, i preoccupy myself with jack renauld.”\\n\\njack renauld! the words gave me a start. i had completely forgotten\\nthat aspect of the case. jack renauld, in prison, with the shadow of\\nthe guillotine looming over him! i saw the part i was playing in a more\\nsinister light. i could save bella—yes, but in doing so i ran the risk\\nof sending an innocent man to his death.\\n\\ni pushed the thought from me with horror. it could not be. he would be\\nacquitted. certainly he would be acquitted! but the cold fear came\\nback. suppose he were not? what then? could i have it on my\\nconscience—horrible thought! would it come to that in the end? a\\ndecision. bella or jack renauld? the promptings of my heart were to\\nsave the girl i loved at any cost to myself. but, if the cost were to\\nanother, the problem was altered.\\n\\nwhat would the girl herself say? i remembered that no word of jack\\nrenauld’s arrest had passed my lips. as yet she was in total ignorance\\nof the fact that her former lover was in prison charged with a hideous\\ncrime which he had not committed. when she knew, how would she act?\\nwould she permit her life to be saved at the expense of his? certainly\\nshe must do nothing rash. jack renauld might, and probably would, be\\nacquitted without any intervention on her part. if so, good. but if he\\nwas not.\\u200a… that was the terrible, the unanswerable problem. i fancied\\nthat she ran no risk of the extreme penalty. the circumstances of the\\ncrime were quite different in her case. she could plead jealousy and\\nextreme provocation, and her youth and beauty would go for much. the\\nfact that by a tragic mistake it was old mr. renauld, and not his son,\\nwho paid the penalty would not alter the motive of the crime. but in\\nany case, however lenient the sentence of the court, it must mean a\\nlong term of imprisonment.\\n\\nno, bella must be protected. and, at the same time, jack renauld must\\nbe saved. how this was to be accomplished i did not see clearly. but i\\npinned my faith to poirot. he knew. come what might, he would manage to\\nsave an innocent man. he must find some pretext other than the real\\none. it might be difficult, but he would manage it somehow. and with\\nbella unsuspected, and jack renauld acquitted, all would end\\nsatisfactorily.\\n\\nso i told myself repeatedly, but at the bottom of my heart there still\\nremained a cold fear.\\n\\n\\n\\n24 “save him!”\\n\\nwe crossed from england by the evening boat, and the following morning\\nsaw us in saint-omer, whither jack renauld had been taken. poirot lost\\nno time in visiting m. hautet. as he did not seem disposed to make any\\nobjections to my accompanying him, i bore him company.\\n\\nafter various formalities and preliminaries, we were conducted to the\\nexamining magistrate’s room. he greeted us cordially.\\n\\n“i was told that you had returned to england, m. poirot. i am glad to\\nfind that such is not the case.”\\n\\n“it is true that i went there, m. le juge, but it was only for a flying\\nvisit. a side issue, but one that i fancied might repay investigation.”\\n\\n“and it did—eh?”\\n\\npoirot shrugged his shoulders. m. hautet nodded, sighing.\\n\\n“we must resign ourselves, i fear. that animal giraud, his manners are\\nabominable, but he is undoubtedly clever! not much chance of that one\\nmaking a mistake.”\\n\\n“you think not, m. le juge?”\\n\\nit was the examining magistrate’s turn to shrug his shoulders.\\n\\n“_eh bien___, speaking frankly—in confidence, _c’est entendu___—can you\\ncome to any other conclusion?”\\n\\n“frankly, m. le juge, there seem to me to be many points that are\\nobscure.”\\n\\n“such as—?”\\n\\nbut poirot was not to be drawn.\\n\\n“i have not yet tabulated them,” he remarked. “it was a general\\nreflection that i was making. i liked the young man, and should be\\nsorry to believe him guilty of such a hideous crime. by the way, what\\nhas he to say for himself on the matter?”\\n\\nthe magistrate frowned.\\n\\n“i cannot understand him. he seems incapable of putting up any sort of\\ndefence. it has been most difficult to get him to answer questions. he\\ncontents himself with a general denial, and beyond that takes refuge in\\na most obstinate silence. i am interrogating him again tomorrow;\\nperhaps you would like to be present?”\\n\\nwe accepted the invitation with _empressement___.\\n\\n“a distressing case,” said the magistrate with a sigh. “my sympathy for\\nmadame renauld is profound.”\\n\\n“how is madame renauld?”\\n\\n“she has not yet recovered consciousness. it is merciful in a way, poor\\nwoman, she is being spared much. the doctors say that there is no\\ndanger, but that when she comes to herself she must be kept as quiet as\\npossible. it was, i understand, quite as much the shock as the fall\\nwhich caused her present state. it would be terrible if her brain\\nbecame unhinged; but i should not wonder at all—no, really, not at\\nall.”\\n\\nm. hautet leaned back, shaking his head, with a sort of mournful\\nenjoyment, as he envisaged the gloomy prospect.\\n\\nhe roused himself at length, and observed with a start.\\n\\n“that reminds me. i have here a letter for you, m. poirot. let me see,\\nwhere did i put it?”\\n\\nhe proceeded to rummage amongst his papers. at last he found the\\nmissive, and handed it to poirot.\\n\\n“it was sent under cover to me in order that i might forward it to\\nyou,” he explained. “but as you left no address i could not do so.”\\n\\npoirot studied the letter curiously. it was addressed in a long,\\nsloping, foreign hand, and the writing was decidedly a woman’s. poirot\\ndid not open it. instead he put it in his pocket and rose to his feet.\\n\\n“_a demain___ then, m. le juge. many thanks for your courtesy and\\namiability.”\\n\\n“but not at all. i am always at your service. these young detectives of\\nthe school of giraud, they are all alike—rude, sneering fellows. they\\ndo not realize that an examining magistrate of my—er—experience is\\nbound to have a certain discernment, a certain—_flair___. _enfin!___\\nthe politeness of the old school is infinitely more to my taste.\\ntherefore, my dear friend, command me in any way you will. we know a\\nthing or two, you and i—eh?”\\n\\nand laughing heartily, enchanted with himself and with us, m. hautet\\nbade us adieu. i am sorry to have to record that poirot’s first remark\\nto me as we traversed the corridor was:\\n\\n“a famous old imbecile, that one! of a stupidity to make pity!”\\n\\nwe were just leaving the building when we came face to face with\\ngiraud, looking more dandified than ever, and thoroughly pleased with\\nhimself.\\n\\n“aha! m. poirot,” he cried airily. “you have returned from england\\nthen?”\\n\\n“as you see,” said poirot.\\n\\n“the end of the case is not far off now, i fancy.”\\n\\n“i agree with you, m. giraud.”\\n\\npoirot spoke in a subdued tone. his crest-fallen manner seemed to\\ndelight the other.\\n\\n“of all the milk and water criminals! not an idea of defending himself.\\nit is extraordinary!”\\n\\n“so extraordinary that it gives one to think, does it not?” suggested\\npoirot mildly.\\n\\nbut giraud was not even listening. he twirled his cane amicably.\\n\\n“well, good day, m. poirot. i am glad you’re satisfied of young\\nrenauld’s guilt at last.”\\n\\n“_pardon!___ but i am not in the least satisfied. jack renauld is\\ninnocent.”\\n\\ngiraud stared for a moment—then burst out laughing, tapping his head\\nsignificantly with the brief remark: “_toqué!___”\\n\\npoirot drew himself up. a dangerous light showed in his eyes.\\n\\n“m. giraud, throughout the case your manner to me has been deliberately\\ninsulting! you need teaching a lesson. i am prepared to wager you 500\\nfrancs that i find the murderer of m. renauld before you do. is it\\nagreed?”\\n\\ngiraud stared helplessly at him, and murmured again:\\n\\n“_toqué!___”\\n\\n“come now,” urged poirot, “is it agreed?”\\n\\n“i have no wish to take your money from you.”\\n\\n“make your mind easy—you will not!”\\n\\n“oh, well then, i agree! you speak of my manner to you being insulting.\\n_eh bien___, once or twice, _your___ manner has annoyed _me___.”\\n\\n“i am enchanted to hear it,” said poirot. “good morning, m. giraud.\\ncome, hastings.”\\n\\ni said no word as we walked along the street. my heart was heavy.\\npoirot had displayed his intentions only too plainly. i doubted more\\nthan ever my powers of saving bella from the consequences of her act.\\nthis unlucky encounter with giraud had roused poirot and put him on his\\nmettle.\\n\\nsuddenly i felt a hand laid on my shoulder, and turned to face gabriel\\nstonor. we stopped and greeted him, and he proposed strolling with us\\nback to our hotel.\\n\\n“and what are you doing here, m. stonor?” inquired poirot.\\n\\n“one must stand by one’s friends,” replied the other dryly. “especially\\nwhen they are unjustly accused.”\\n\\n“then you do not believe that jack renauld committed the crime?” i\\nasked eagerly.\\n\\n“certainly i don’t. i know the lad. i admit that there have been one or\\ntwo things in this business that have staggered me completely, but none\\nthe less, in spite of his fool way of taking it, i’ll never believe\\nthat jack renauld is a murderer.”\\n\\nmy heart warmed to the secretary. his words seemed to lift a secret\\nweight from my heart.\\n\\n“i have no doubt that many people feel as you do,” i exclaimed. “there\\nis really absurdly little evidence against him. i should say that there\\nwas no doubt of his acquittal—no doubt whatever.”\\n\\nbut stonor hardly responded as i could have wished.\\n\\n“i’d give a lot to think as you do,” he said gravely. he turned to\\npoirot. “what’s your opinion, monsieur?”\\n\\n“i think that things look very black against him,” said poirot quietly.\\n\\n“you believe him guilty?” said stonor sharply.\\n\\n“no. but i think he will find it hard to prove his innocence.”\\n\\n“he’s behaving so damned queerly,” muttered stonor. “of course i\\nrealize that there’s a lot more in this affair than meets the eye.\\ngiraud’s not wise to that because he’s an outsider, but the whole thing\\nhas been damned odd. as to that, least said soonest mended. if mrs.\\nrenauld wants to hush anything up, i’ll take my cue from her. it’s her\\nshow, and i’ve too much respect for her judgment to shove my oar in,\\nbut i can’t get behind this attitude of jack’s. any one would think he\\n_wanted___ to be thought guilty.”\\n\\n“but it’s absurd,” i cried, bursting in. “for one thing, the dagger—” i\\npaused, uncertain as to how much poirot would wish me to reveal. i\\ncontinued, choosing my words carefully, “we know that the dagger could\\nnot have been in jack renauld’s possession that evening. mrs. renauld\\nknows that.”\\n\\n“true,” said stonor. “when she recovers, she will doubtless say all\\nthis and more. well, i must be leaving you.”\\n\\n“one moment.” poirot’s hand arrested his departure. “can you arrange\\nfor word to be sent to me at once should madame renauld recover\\nconsciousness?”\\n\\n“certainly. that’s easily done.”\\n\\n“that point about the dagger is good, poirot,” i urged as we went\\nupstairs. “i couldn’t speak very plainly before stonor.”\\n\\n“that was quite right of you. we might as well keep the knowledge to\\nourselves as long as we can. as to the dagger, your point hardly helps\\njack renauld. you remember that i was absent for an hour this morning,\\nbefore we started from london?”\\n\\n“yes?”\\n\\n“well, i was employed in trying to find the firm jack renauld employed\\nto convert his souvenirs. it was not very difficult. _eh bien___,\\nhastings, they made to his order not _two___ paper-knives, but\\n_three___.”\\n\\n“so that—?”\\n\\n“so that, after giving one to his mother, and one to bella duveen,\\nthere was a third which he doubtless retained for his own use. no,\\nhastings, i fear the dagger question will not help us to save him from\\nthe guillotine.”\\n\\n“it won’t come to that,” i cried, stung.\\n\\npoirot shook his head uncertainly.\\n\\n“you will save him,” i cried positively.\\n\\npoirot glanced at me dryly.\\n\\n“have you not rendered it impossible, _mon ami?___”\\n\\n“some other way,” i muttered.\\n\\n“ah! _sapristi!___ but it is miracles you ask from me. no—say no more.\\nlet us instead see what is in this letter.”\\n\\nand he drew out the envelope from his breast pocket.\\n\\nhis face contracted as he read, then he handed the one flimsy sheet to\\nme.\\n\\n“there are other women in the world who suffer, hastings.”\\n\\nthe writing was blurred and the note had evidently been written in\\ngreat agitation:\\n\\n“_dear m. poirot:___\\n“if you get this, i beg of you to come to my aid. i have no one to turn\\nto, and at all costs jack must be saved. i implore of you on my knees\\nto help us.\\n\\n\\n“marthe daubreuil.”\\n\\n\\ni handed it back, moved.\\n\\n“you will go?”\\n\\n“at once. we will command an auto.”\\n\\nhalf an hour later saw us at the villa marguerite. marthe was at the\\ndoor to meet us, and led poirot in, clinging with both hands to one of\\nhis.\\n\\n“ah, you have come—it is good of you. i have been in despair, not\\nknowing what to do. they will not let me go to see him in prison even.\\ni suffer horribly, i am nearly mad. is it true what they say, that he\\ndoes not deny the crime? but that is madness. it is impossible that he\\nshould have done it! never for one minute will i believe it.”\\n\\n“neither do i believe it, mademoiselle,” said poirot gently.\\n\\n“but then why does he not speak? i do not understand.”\\n\\n“perhaps because he is screening some one,” suggested poirot, watching\\nher.\\n\\nmarthe frowned.\\n\\n“screening some one? do you mean his mother? ah, from the beginning i\\nhave suspected her. who inherits all that vast fortune? she does. it is\\neasy to wear widow’s weeds and play the hypocrite. and they say that\\nwhen he was arrested she fell down—like _that___.” she made a dramatic\\ngesture. “and without doubt, m. stonor, the secretary, he helped her.\\nthey are thick as thieves, those two. it is true she is older than\\nhe—but what do men care—if a woman is rich!”\\n\\nthere was a hint of bitterness in her tone.\\n\\n“stonor was in england,” i put in.\\n\\n“he says so—but who knows?”\\n\\n“mademoiselle,” said poirot quietly, “if we are to work together, you\\nand i, we must have things clear. first, i will ask you a question.”\\n\\n“yes, monsieur?”\\n\\n“are you aware of your mother’s real name?”\\n\\nmarthe looked at him for a minute, then, letting her head fall forward\\non her arms, she burst into tears.\\n\\n“there, there,” said poirot, patting her on the shoulder. “calm\\nyourself, _petite___, i see that you know. now a second question, did\\nyou know who m. renauld was?”\\n\\n“m. renauld,” she raised her head from her hands and gazed at him\\nwonderingly.\\n\\n“ah, i see you do not know that. now listen to me carefully.”\\n\\nstep by step, he went over the case, much as he had done to me on the\\nday of our departure for england. marthe listened spellbound. when he\\nhad finished, she drew a long breath.\\n\\n“but you are wonderful—magnificent! you are the greatest detective in\\nthe world.”\\n\\nwith a swift gesture she slipped off her chair and knelt before him\\nwith an abandonment that was wholly french.\\n\\n“save him, monsieur,” she cried. “i love him so. oh, save him, save\\nhim—save him!”\\n\\n\\n\\n25 an unexpected dénouement\\n\\nwe were present the following morning at the examination of jack\\nrenauld. short as the time had been, i was shocked at the change that\\nhad taken place in the young prisoner. his cheeks had fallen in, there\\nwere deep black circles round his eyes, and he looked haggard and\\ndistraught, as one who had wooed sleep in vain for several nights. he\\nbetrayed no emotion at seeing us.\\n\\nthe prisoner and his counsel, maître grosíer, were accommodated with\\nchairs. a formidable guard with resplendent sabre stood before the\\ndoor. the patient _greffier___ sat at his desk. the examination began.\\n\\n“renauld,” began the magistrate, “do you deny that you were in\\nmerlinville on the night of the crime?”\\n\\njack did not reply at once, then he said with a hesitancy of manner\\nwhich was piteous:\\n\\n“i—i—told you that i was in cherbourg.”\\n\\nmaître grosíer frowned and sighed. i realized at once that jack renauld\\nwas obstinately bent on conducting his own case as he wished, to the\\ndespair of his legal representative.\\n\\nthe magistrate turned sharply.\\n\\n“send in the station witnesses.”\\n\\nin a moment or two the door opened to admit a man whom i recognized as\\nbeing a porter at merlinville station.\\n\\n“you were on duty on the night of june 7th?”\\n\\n“yes, monsieur.”\\n\\n“you witnessed the arrival of the 11:40 train?”\\n\\n“yes, monsieur.”\\n\\n“look at the prisoner. do you recognize him as having been one of the\\npassengers to alight?”\\n\\n“yes, monsieur le juge.”\\n\\n“there is no possibility of your being mistaken?”\\n\\n“no, monsieur. i knew m. jack renauld well.”\\n\\n“nor of your being mistaken as to the date?”\\n\\n“no, monsieur. because it was the following morning, june 8th, that we\\nheard of the murder.”\\n\\nanother railway official was brought in, and confirmed the first one’s\\nevidence. the magistrate looked at jack renauld.\\n\\n“these men have identified you positively. what have you to say?”\\n\\njack shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n“nothing.”\\n\\nm. hautet exchanged a glance with the _greffier___, as the scratching\\nof the latter’s pen recorded the answer.\\n\\n“renauld,” continued the magistrate, “do you recognize this?”\\n\\nhe took something from the table by his side, and held it out to the\\nprisoner. i shuddered as i recognized the aeroplane dagger.\\n\\n“pardon,” cried maître grosíer. “i demand to speak to my client before\\nhe answers that question.”\\n\\nbut jack renauld had no consideration for the feelings of the wretched\\ngrosíer. he waved him aside, and replied quietly:\\n\\n“certainly i recognize it. it is a present given by me to my mother, as\\na souvenir of the war.”\\n\\n“is there, as far as you know, any duplicate of that dagger in\\nexistence?”\\n\\nagain maître grosíer burst out, and again jack overrode him.\\n\\n“not that i know of. the setting was my own design.”\\n\\neven the magistrate almost gasped at the boldness of the reply. it did,\\nin very truth, seem as though jack was rushing on his fate. i realized,\\nof course, the vital necessity he was under of concealing, for bella’s\\nsake, the fact that there was a duplicate dagger in the case. so long\\nas there was supposed to be only one weapon, no suspicion was likely to\\nattach to the girl who had had the second paper-knife in her\\npossession. he was valiantly shielding the woman he had once loved—but\\nat what a cost to himself! i began to realize the magnitude of the task\\ni had so lightly set poirot. it would not be easy to secure the\\nacquittal of jack renauld, by anything short of the truth.\\n\\nm. hautet spoke again, with a peculiarly biting inflection:\\n\\n“madame renauld told us that this dagger was on her dressing table on\\nthe night of the crime. but madame renauld is a mother! it will\\ndoubtless astonish you, renauld, but i consider it highly likely that\\nmadame renauld was mistaken, and that, by inadvertence perhaps, you had\\ntaken it with you to paris. doubtless you will contradict me—”\\n\\ni saw the lad’s handcuffed hands clench themselves. the perspiration\\nstood out in beads upon his brow, as with a supreme effort he\\ninterrupted m. hautet in a hoarse voice:\\n\\n“i shall not contradict you. it is possible.”\\n\\nit was a stupefying moment. maître grosíer rose to his feet,\\nprotesting:\\n\\n“my client has undergone a considerable nervous strain. i should wish\\nit put on record that i do not consider him answerable for what he\\nsays.”\\n\\nthe magistrate quelled him angrily. for a moment a doubt seemed to\\narise in his own mind. jack renauld had almost overdone his part. he\\nleaned forward, and gazed at the prisoner searchingly.\\n\\n“do you fully understand, renauld, that on the answers you have given\\nme i shall have no alternative but to commit you for trial?”\\n\\njack’s pale face flushed. he looked steadily back.\\n\\n“m. hautet, i swear that i did not kill my father.”\\n\\nbut the magistrate’s brief moment of doubt was over. he laughed a\\nshort, unpleasant laugh.\\n\\n“without doubt, without doubt—they are always innocent, our prisoners!\\nby your own mouth you are condemned. you can offer no defence, no\\nalibi—only a mere assertion which would not deceive a babe!—that you\\nare not guilty. you killed your father, renauld—cruel and cowardly\\nmurder—for the sake of money which you believed would come to you at\\nhis death. your mother was an accessory after the fact. doubtless, in\\nview of the fact that she acted as a mother, the courts will extend an\\nindulgence to her that they will not accord to you. and rightly so!\\nyour crime was a horrible one—to be held in abhorrence by gods and\\nmen!” m. hautet was enjoying himself, working up his period, steeped in\\nthe solemnity of the moment, and his own role as representative of\\njustice. “you killed—and you must pay the consequences of your action.\\ni speak to you, not as a man, but as justice, eternal justice, which—”\\n\\nm. hautet was interrupted—to his intense annoyance. the door was pushed\\nopen.\\n\\n“m. le juge, m. le juge,” stammered the attendant, “there is a lady who\\nsays—who says—”\\n\\n“who says what?” cried the justly incensed magistrate. “this is highly\\nirregular. i forbid it—i absolutely forbid it.”\\n\\nbut a slender figure pushed the stammering gendarme aside. dressed all\\nin black, with a long veil that hid her face, she advanced into the\\nroom.\\n\\nmy heart gave a sickening throb. she had come then! all my efforts were\\nin vain. yet i could not but admire the courage that had led her to\\ntake this step so unfalteringly.\\n\\nshe raised her veil—and i gasped. for, though as like her as two peas,\\nthis girl was not cinderella! on the other hand, now that i saw her\\nwithout the fair wig she had worn on the stage, i recognized her as the\\ngirl of the photograph in jack renauld’s room.\\n\\n“you are the juge d’instruction, m. hautet?” she queried.\\n\\n“yes, but i forbid—”\\n\\n“my name is bella duveen. i wish to give myself up for the murder of\\nmr. renauld.”\\n\\n\\n\\n26 i receive a letter\\n\\n“_my friend:___\\n    “you will know all when you get this. nothing that i can say will\\n    move bella. she has gone out to give herself up. i am tired out\\n    with struggling.\\n    “you will know now that i deceived you, that where you gave me\\n    trust i repaid you with lies. it will seem, perhaps, indefensible\\n    to you, but i should like, before i go out of your life for ever,\\n    to show you just how it all came about. if i knew that you forgave\\n    me, it would make life easier for me. it wasn’t for myself i did\\n    it—that’s the only thing i can put forward to say for myself.\\n    “i’ll begin from the day i met you in the boat train from paris. i\\n    was uneasy then about bella. she was just desperate about jack\\n    renauld, she’d have lain down on the ground for him to walk on, and\\n    when he began to change, and to stop writing so often, she began\\n    getting in a state. she got it into her head that he was keen on\\n    another girl—and of course, as it turned out afterwards, she was\\n    quite right there. she’d made up her mind to go to their villa at\\n    merlinville, and try and see jack. she knew i was against it, and\\n    tried to give me the slip. i found she was not on the train at\\n    calais, and determined i would not go on to england without her.\\n    i’d an uneasy feeling that something awful was going to happen if i\\n    couldn’t prevent it.\\n    “i met the next train from paris. she was on it, and set upon going\\n    out then and there to merlinville. i argued with her for all i was\\n    worth, but it wasn’t any good. she was all strung up and set upon\\n    having her own way. well, i washed my hands of it. i’d done all i\\n    could! it was getting late. i went to an hotel, and bella started\\n    for merlinville. i still couldn’t shake off my feeling of what the\\n    books call ‘impending disaster.’\\n    “the next day came—but no bella. she’d made a date with me to meet\\n    at the hotel, but she didn’t keep it. no sign of her all day. i got\\n    more and more anxious. then came an evening paper with the news.\\n    “it was awful! i couldn’t be sure, of course—but i was terribly\\n    afraid. i figured it out that bella had met papa renauld and told\\n    him about her and jack, and that he’d insulted her or something\\n    like that. we’ve both got terribly quick tempers.\\n    “then all the masked foreigner business came out, and i began to\\n    feel more at ease. but it still worried me that bella hadn’t kept\\n    her date with me.\\n    “by the next morning, i was so rattled that i’d just got to go and\\n    see what i could. first thing, i ran up against you. you know all\\n    that\\u200a… when i saw the dead man, looking so like jack, and wearing\\n    jack’s fancy overcoat, i knew! and there was the identical\\n    paper-knife—wicked little thing!—that jack had given bella! ten to\\n    one it had her finger-marks on it. i can’t hope to explain to you\\n    the sort of helpless horror of that moment. i only saw one thing\\n    clearly—i must get hold of that dagger, and get right away with it\\n    before they found out it was gone. i pretended to faint, and whilst\\n    you were away getting water i took the thing and hid it away in my\\n    dress.\\n    “i told you that i was staying at the hôtel du phare, but of course\\n    really i made a bee line back to calais, and then on to england by\\n    the first boat. when we were in mid-channel, i dropped that little\\n    devil of a dagger into the sea. then i felt i could breathe again.\\n    “bella was at our digs in london. she looked like nothing on god’s\\n    earth. i told her what i’d done, and that she was pretty safe for\\n    the time being. she stared at me, and then began laughing\\u200a…\\n    laughing\\u200a… laughing\\u200a… it was horrible to hear her! i felt that the\\n    best thing to do was to keep busy. she’d go mad if she had time to\\n    brood on what she’d done. luckily we got an engagement at once.\\n    “and then, i saw you and your friend, watching us that night\\u200a… i\\n    was frantic. you must suspect, or you wouldn’t have tracked us\\n    down. i had to know the worst, so i followed you. i was desperate.\\n    and then, before i’d had time to say anything, i tumbled to it that\\n    it was _me___ you suspected, not bella! or at least that you\\n    thought i _was___ bella since i’d stolen the dagger.\\n    “i wish, honey, that you could see back into my mind at that\\n    moment\\u200a… you’d forgive me, perhaps\\u200a… i was so frightened, and\\n    muddled, and desperate.\\u200a… all i could get clearly was that you\\n    would try and save me. i didn’t know whether you’d be willing to\\n    save her\\u200a… i thought very likely not—it wasn’t the same thing! and\\n    i couldn’t risk it! bella’s my twin—i’d got to do the best for her.\\n    so i went on lying.\\u200a… i felt mean—i feel mean still.\\u200a… that’s\\n    all—enough too, you’ll say, i expect. i ought to have trusted\\n    you.\\u200a… if i had—\\n    “as soon as the news was in the paper that jack renauld had been\\n    arrested, it was all up. bella wouldn’t even wait to see how things\\n    went.\\u200a…\\n    “i’m very tired.\\u200a… i can’t write any more.\\u200a…”\\n\\n\\nshe had begun to sign herself cinderella, but had crossed that out and\\nwritten instead “dulcie duveen.”\\n\\nit was an ill-written, blurred epistle but i have kept it to this day.\\n\\npoirot was with me when i read it. the sheets fell from my hand, and i\\nlooked across at him.\\n\\n“did you know all the time that it was—the other?”\\n\\n“yes, my friend.”\\n\\n“why did you not tell me?”\\n\\n“to begin with, i could hardly believe it conceivable that you could\\nmake such a mistake. you had seen the photograph. the sisters are very\\nalike, but by no means incapable of distinguishment.”\\n\\n“but the fair hair?”\\n\\n“a wig, worn for the sake of a piquant contrast on the stage. is it\\nconceivable that with twins one should be fair and one dark?”\\n\\n“why didn’t you tell me that night at the hotel in coventry?”\\n\\n“you were rather high-handed in your methods, _mon ami___,” said poirot\\ndryly. “you did not give me a chance.”\\n\\n“but afterwards?”\\n\\n“ah, afterwards! well, to begin with, i was hurt at your want of faith\\nin me. and then, i wanted to see whether your—feelings would stand the\\ntest of time. in fact, whether it was love, or a flash in the pan, with\\nyou. i should not have left you long in your error.”\\n\\ni nodded. his tone was too affectionate for me to bear resentment. i\\nlooked down on the sheets of the letter. suddenly i picked them up from\\nthe floor, and pushed them across to him.\\n\\n“read that,” i said. “i’d like you to.”\\n\\nhe read it through in silence, then he looked up at me.\\n\\n“what is it that worries you, hastings?”\\n\\nthis was quite a new mood in poirot. his mocking manner seemed laid\\nquite aside. i was able to say what i wanted without too much\\ndifficulty.\\n\\n“she doesn’t say—she doesn’t say—well, not whether she cares for me or\\nnot!”\\n\\npoirot turned back the pages.\\n\\n“i think you are mistaken, hastings.”\\n\\n“where?” i cried, leaning forward eagerly.\\n\\npoirot smiled.\\n\\n“she tells you that in every line of the letter, _mon ami___.”\\n\\n“but where am i to find her? there’s no address on the letter. there’s\\na french stamp, that’s all.”\\n\\n“excite yourself not! leave it to papa poirot. i can find her for you\\nas soon as i have five little minutes!”\\n\\n\\n\\n27 jack renauld’s story\\n\\n“congratulations, m. jack,” said poirot, wringing the lad warmly by the\\nhand.\\n\\nyoung renauld had come to us as soon as he was liberated—before\\nstarting for merlinville to rejoin marthe and his mother. stonor\\naccompanied him. his heartiness was in strong contrast to the lad’s wan\\nlooks. it was plain that the boy was on the verge of a nervous\\nbreakdown. although delivered from the immediate peril that was hanging\\nover him, the circumstances of his release were too painful to let him\\nfeel full relief. he smiled mournfully at poirot, and said in a low\\nvoice:\\n\\n“i went through it to protect her, and now it’s all no use!”\\n\\n“you could hardly expect the girl to accept the price of your life,”\\nremarked stonor dryly. “she was bound to come forward when she saw you\\nheading straight for the guillotine.”\\n\\n“_eh ma foi!___ and you were heading for it too!” added poirot, with a\\nslight twinkle. “you would have had maître grosíer’s death from rage on\\nyour conscience if you had gone on.”\\n\\n“he was a well meaning ass, i suppose,” said jack. “but he worried me\\nhorribly. you see, i couldn’t very well take him into my confidence.\\nbut, my god! what’s going to happen about bella?”\\n\\n“if i were you,” said poirot frankly, “i should not distress myself\\nunduly. the french courts are very lenient to youth and beauty, and the\\n_crime passionnel___. a clever lawyer will make out a great case of\\nextenuating circumstances. it will not be pleasant for you—”\\n\\n“i don’t care about that. you see, m. poirot, in a way i _do___ feel\\nguilty of my father’s murder. but for me, and my entanglement with this\\ngirl, he would be alive and well today. and then my cursed carelessness\\nin taking away the wrong overcoat. i can’t help feeling responsible for\\nhis death. it will haunt me for ever!”\\n\\n“no, no,” i said soothingly.\\n\\n“of course it’s horrible to me to think that bella killed my father,”\\nresumed jack, “but i’d treated her shamefully. after i met marthe, and\\nrealized i’d made a mistake, i ought to have written and told her so\\nhonestly. but i was so terrified of a row, and of its coming to\\nmarthe’s ears, and her thinking there was more in it than there ever\\nhad been, that—well, i was a coward, and went on hoping the thing would\\ndie down of itself. i just drifted, in fact—not realizing that i was\\ndriving the poor kid desperate. if she’d really knifed me, as she meant\\nto, i should have got no more than my deserts. and the way she’s come\\nforward now is downright plucky. i’d have stood the racket, you know—up\\nto the end.”\\n\\nhe was silent for a moment or two, and then burst out on another tack:\\n\\n“what gets me is why the governor should be wandering about in\\nunderclothes and my overcoat at that time of night. i suppose he’d just\\ngiven the foreign johnnies the slip, and my mother must have made a\\nmistake about its being 2 o’clock when they came. or—or, it wasn’t all\\na frame up, was it? i mean, my mother didn’t think—couldn’t\\nthink—that—that it was _me?___”\\n\\npoirot reassured him quickly.\\n\\n“no, no, m. jack. have no fears on that score. as for the rest, i will\\nexplain it to you one of these days. it is rather curious. but will you\\nrecount to us exactly what did occur on that terrible evening?”\\n\\n“there’s very little to tell. i came from cherbourg, as i told you, in\\norder to see marthe before going to the other end of the world. the\\ntrain was late, and i decided to take the short cut across the golf\\nlinks. i could easily get into the grounds of the villa marguerite from\\nthere. i had nearly reached the place when—”\\n\\nhe paused and swallowed.\\n\\n“yes?”\\n\\n“i heard a terrible cry. it wasn’t loud—a sort of choke and gasp—but it\\nfrightened me. for a moment i stood rooted to the spot. then i came\\nround the corner of a bush. there was moonlight. i saw the grave, and a\\nfigure lying face downwards, with a dagger sticking in the back. and\\nthen—and then—i looked up and saw _her___. she was looking at me as\\nthough she saw a ghost—it’s what she must have thought me at first—all\\nexpression seemed frozen out of her face by horror. and then she gave a\\ncry, and turned and ran.”\\n\\nhe stopped, trying to master his emotion.\\n\\n“and afterwards?” asked poirot gently.\\n\\n“i really don’t know. i stayed there for a time, dazed. and then i\\nrealized i’d better get away as fast as i could. it didn’t occur to me\\nthat they would suspect me, but i was afraid of being called upon to\\ngive evidence against her. i walked to st. beauvais as i told you, and\\ngot a car from there back to cherbourg.”\\n\\na knock came at the door, and a page entered with a telegram which he\\ndelivered to stonor. he tore it open. then he got up from his seat.\\n\\n“mrs. renauld has regained consciousness,” he said.\\n\\n“ah!” poirot sprang to his feet. “let us all go to merlinville at\\nonce!”\\n\\na hurried departure was made forthwith. stonor, at jack’s instance,\\nagreed to stay behind and do all that could be done for bella duveen.\\npoirot, jack renauld and i set off in the renauld car.\\n\\nthe run took just over forty minutes. as we approached the doorway of\\nthe villa marguerite, jack renauld shot a questioning glance at poirot.\\n\\n“how would it be if you went on first—to break the news to my mother\\nthat i am free—”\\n\\n“while you break it in person to mademoiselle marthe, eh?” finished\\npoirot, with a twinkle. “but yes, by all means, i was about to propose\\nsuch an arrangement myself.”\\n\\njack renauld did not wait for more. stopping the car, he swung himself\\nout, and ran up the path to the front door. we went on in the car to\\nthe villa geneviève.\\n\\n“poirot,” i said, “do you remember how we arrived here that first day?\\nand were met by the news of m. renauld’s murder?”\\n\\n“ah! yes, truly. not so long ago, either. but what a lot of things have\\nhappened since then—especially for you, _mon ami!___”\\n\\n“poirot, what have you done about finding bel—i mean dulcie?”\\n\\n“calm yourself, hastings. i arrange everything.”\\n\\n“you’re being a precious long time about it,” i grumbled.\\n\\npoirot changed the subject.\\n\\n“then the beginning, now the end,” he moralized, as we rang the bell.\\n“and, considered as a case, the end is profoundly unsatisfactory.”\\n\\n“yes, indeed,” i sighed.\\n\\n“you are regarding it from the sentimental standpoint, hastings. that\\nwas not my meaning. we will hope that mademoiselle bella will be dealt\\nwith leniently, and after all jack renauld cannot marry both the girls.\\ni spoke from a professional standpoint. this is not a crime well\\nordered and regular, such as a detective delights in. the _mise en\\nscène___ designed by georges conneau, that indeed is perfect, but the\\n_dénouement___—ah, no! a man killed by accident in a girl’s fit of\\nanger—ah, indeed, what order or method is there in that?”\\n\\nand in the midst of a fit of laughter on my part at poirot’s\\npeculiarities, the door was opened by françoise.\\n\\npoirot explained that he must see mrs. renauld at once, and the old\\nwoman conducted him upstairs. i remained in the _salon___. it was some\\ntime before poirot reappeared. he was looking unusually grave.\\n\\n“_vous voilà___, hastings! _sacré tonnerre___, but there are squalls\\nahead!”\\n\\n“what do you mean?” i cried.\\n\\n“i would hardly have credited it,” said poirot thoughtfully, “but women\\nare very unexpected.”\\n\\n“here are jack and marthe daubreuil,” i exclaimed, looking out of the\\nwindow.\\n\\npoirot bounded out of the room, and met the young couple on the steps\\noutside.\\n\\n“do not enter. it is better not. your mother is very upset.”\\n\\n“i know, i know,” said jack renauld. “i must go up to her at once.”\\n\\n“but no, i tell you. it is better not.”\\n\\n“but marthe and i—”\\n\\n“in any case, do not take mademoiselle with you. mount, if you must,\\nbut you would be wise to be guided by me.”\\n\\na voice on the stairs behind made us all start.\\n\\n“i thank you for your good offices, m. poirot, but i will make my own\\nwishes clear.”\\n\\nwe stared in astonishment. descending the stairs, leaning upon léonie’s\\narm, was mrs. renauld, her head still bandaged. the french girl was\\nweeping, and imploring her mistress to return to bed.\\n\\n“madame will kill herself. it is contrary to all the doctor’s orders!”\\n\\nbut mrs. renauld came on.\\n\\n“mother,” cried jack, starting forward. but with a gesture she drove\\nhim back.\\n\\n“i am no mother of yours! you are no son of mine! from this day and\\nhour i renounce you.”\\n\\n“mother,” cried the lad, stupefied.\\n\\nfor a moment she seemed to waver, to falter before the anguish in his\\nvoice. poirot made a mediating gesture, but instantly she regained\\ncommand of herself.\\n\\n“your father’s blood is on your head. you are morally guilty of his\\ndeath. you thwarted and defied him over this girl, and by your\\nheartless treatment of another girl, you brought about his death. go\\nout from my house. tomorrow i intend to take such steps as shall make\\nit certain that you shall never touch a penny of his money. make your\\nway in the world as best you can with the help of the girl who is the\\ndaughter of your father’s bitterest enemy!”\\n\\nand slowly, painfully, she retraced her way upstairs.\\n\\nwe were all dumbfounded—totally unprepared for such a demonstration.\\njack renauld, worn out with all he had already gone through, swayed and\\nnearly fell. poirot and i went quickly to his assistance.\\n\\n“he is overdone,” murmured poirot to marthe. “where can we take him?”\\n\\n“but home! to the villa marguerite. we will nurse him, my mother and i.\\nmy poor jack!”\\n\\nwe got the lad to the villa, where he dropped limply on to a chair in a\\nsemi-dazed condition. poirot felt his head and hands.\\n\\n“he has fever. the long strain begins to tell. and now this shock on\\ntop of it. get him to bed, and hastings and i will summon a doctor.”\\n\\na doctor was soon procured. after examining the patient, he gave it as\\nhis opinion that it was simply a case of nerve strain. with perfect\\nrest and quiet, the lad might be almost restored by the next day, but,\\nif excited, there was a chance of brain fever. it would be advisable\\nfor some one to sit up all night with him.\\n\\nfinally, having done all we could, we left him in the charge of marthe\\nand her mother, and set out for the town. it was past our usual hour of\\ndining, and we were both famished. the first restaurant we came to\\nassuaged the pangs of hunger with an excellent _omelette___, and an\\nequally excellent _entrecôte___ to follow.\\n\\n“and now for quarters for the night,” said poirot, when at length _café\\nnoir___ had completed the meal. “shall we try our old friend, the hôtel\\ndes bains?”\\n\\nwe traced our steps there without more ado. yes, messieurs could be\\naccommodated with two good rooms overlooking the sea. then poirot asked\\na question which surprised me.\\n\\n“has an english lady, miss robinson, arrived?”\\n\\n“yes, monsieur. she is in the little _salon___.”\\n\\n“ah!”\\n\\n“poirot,” i cried, keeping pace with him as he walked along the\\ncorridor, “who on earth is miss robinson?”\\n\\npoirot beamed kindly on me.\\n\\n“it is that i have arranged you a marriage, hastings.”\\n\\n“but, i say—”\\n\\n“bah!” said poirot, giving me a friendly push over the threshold of the\\ndoor. “do you think i wish to trumpet aloud in merlinville the name of\\nduveen?”\\n\\nit was indeed cinderella who rose to greet us. i took her hands in both\\nof mine. my eyes said the rest.\\n\\npoirot cleared his throat.\\n\\n“_mes enfants___,” he said, “for the moment we have no time for\\nsentiment. there is work ahead of us. mademoiselle, were you able to do\\nwhat i asked you?”\\n\\nin response, cinderella took from her bag an object wrapped up in\\npaper, and handed it silently to poirot. the latter unwrapped it. i\\ngave a start—for it was the aeroplane dagger which i understood she had\\ncast into the sea. strange, how reluctant women always are to destroy\\nthe most compromising of objects and documents!\\n\\n“_très bien, mon enfant___,” said poirot. “i am pleased with you. go\\nnow and rest yourself. hastings here and i have work to do. you shall\\nsee him tomorrow.”\\n\\n“where are you going?” asked the girl, her eyes widening.\\n\\n“you shall hear all about it tomorrow.”\\n\\n“because wherever you’re going, i’m coming too.”\\n\\n“but mademoiselle—”\\n\\n“i’m coming too, i tell you.”\\n\\npoirot realized that it was futile to argue further. he gave in.\\n\\n“come then, mademoiselle. but it will not be amusing. in all\\nprobability nothing will happen.”\\n\\nthe girl made no reply.\\n\\ntwenty minutes later we set forth. it was quite dark now, a close,\\noppressive evening. poirot led the way out of the town in the direction\\nof the villa geneviève. but when he reached the villa marguerite he\\npaused.\\n\\n“i should like to assure myself that all goes well with jack renauld.\\ncome with me, hastings. mademoiselle will perhaps remain outside.\\nmadame daubreuil might say something which would wound her.”\\n\\nwe unlatched the gate, and walked up the path. as we went round to the\\nside of the house, i drew poirot’s attention to a window on the first\\nfloor. thrown sharply on the blind was the profile of marthe daubreuil.\\n\\n“ah!” said poirot. “i figure to myself that that is the room where we\\nshall find jack renauld.”\\n\\nmadame daubreuil opened the door to us. she explained that jack was\\nmuch the same, but perhaps we would like to see for ourselves. she led\\nus upstairs and into the bedroom. marthe daubreuil was embroidering by\\na table with a lamp on it. she put her finger to her lips as we\\nentered.\\n\\njack renauld was sleeping an uneasy fitful sleep, his head turning from\\nside to side, and his face still unduly flushed.\\n\\n“is the doctor coming again?” asked poirot in a whisper.\\n\\n“not unless we send. he is sleeping—that is the great thing. _maman___\\nmade him a tisane.”\\n\\nshe sat down again with her embroidery as we left the room. madame\\ndaubreuil accompanied us down the stairs. since i had learned of her\\npast history, i viewed this woman with increased interest. she stood\\nthere with her eyes cast down, the same very faint enigmatical smile\\nthat i remembered on her lips. and suddenly i felt afraid of her, as\\none might feel afraid of a beautiful poisonous snake.\\n\\n“i hope we have not deranged you, madame,” said poirot politely as she\\nopened the door for us to pass out.\\n\\n“not at all, monsieur.”\\n\\n“by the way,” said poirot, as though struck by an afterthought, “m.\\nstonor has not been in merlinville today, has he?”\\n\\ni could not at all fathom the point of this question which i well knew\\nto be meaningless as far as poirot was concerned.\\n\\nmadame daubreuil replied quite composedly:\\n\\n“not that i know of.”\\n\\n“he has not had an interview with mrs. renauld?”\\n\\n“how should i know that, monsieur?”\\n\\n“true,” said poirot. “i thought you might have seen him coming or\\ngoing, that is all. good night, madame.”\\n\\n“why—” i began.\\n\\n“no ‘_whys___,’ hastings. there will be time for that later.”\\n\\nwe rejoined cinderella and made our way rapidly in the direction of the\\nvilla geneviève. poirot looked over his shoulder once at the lighted\\nwindow and the profile of marthe as she bent over her work.\\n\\n“he is being guarded at all events,” he muttered.\\n\\narrived at the villa geneviève, poirot took up his stand behind some\\nbushes to the left of the drive, where, whilst enjoying a good view\\nourselves, we were completely hidden from sight. the villa itself was\\nin total darkness, everybody was without doubt in bed and asleep. we\\nwere almost immediately under the window of mrs. renauld’s bedroom,\\nwhich window, i noticed, was open. it seemed to me that it was upon\\nthis spot that poirot’s eyes were fixed.\\n\\n“what are we going to do?” i whispered.\\n\\n“watch.”\\n\\n“but—”\\n\\n“i do not expect anything to happen for at least an hour, probably two\\nhours, but the—”\\n\\nbut his words were interrupted by a long thin drawn cry:\\n\\n“help!”\\n\\na light flashed up in the second floor room on the right hand side of\\nthe house. the cry came from there. and even as we watched there came a\\nshadow on the blind as of two people struggling.\\n\\n“_mille tonnerres!___” cried poirot. “she must have changed her room!”\\n\\ndashing forward, he battered wildly on the front door. then rushing to\\nthe tree in the flower-bed, he swarmed up it with the agility of a cat.\\ni followed him, as with a bound he sprang in through the open window.\\nlooking over my shoulder, i saw dulcie reaching the branch behind me.\\n\\n“take care,” i exclaimed.\\n\\n“take care of your grandmother!” retorted the girl. “this is child’s\\nplay to me.”\\n\\npoirot had rushed through the empty room and was pounding on the door\\nleading into the corridor.\\n\\n“locked and bolted on the outside,” he growled. “and it will take time\\nto burst it open.”\\n\\nthe cries for help were getting noticeably fainter. i saw despair in\\npoirot’s eyes. he and i together put our shoulders to the door.\\n\\ncinderella’s voice, calm and dispassionate, came from the window:\\n\\n“you’ll be too late, i guess i’m the only one who can do anything.”\\n\\nbefore i could move a hand to stop her, she appeared to leap upward\\ninto space. i rushed and looked out. to my horror, i saw her hanging by\\nher hands from the roof, propelling herself along by jerks in the\\ndirection of the lighted window.\\n\\n“good heavens! she’ll be killed,” i cried.\\n\\n“you forget. she’s a professional acrobat, hastings. it was the\\nprovidence of the good god that made her insist on coming with us\\ntonight. i only pray that she may be in time. ah!”\\n\\na cry of absolute terror floated out on to the night as the girl\\ndisappeared through the right-hand window; then in cinderella’s clear\\ntones came the words:\\n\\n“no, you don’t! i’ve got you—and my wrists are just like steel.”\\n\\nat the same moment the door of our prison was opened cautiously by\\nfrançoise. poirot brushed her aside unceremoniously and rushed down the\\npassage to where the other maids were grouped round the further door.\\n\\n“it’s locked on the inside, monsieur.”\\n\\nthere was the sound of a heavy fall within. after a moment or two the\\nkey turned and the door swung slowly open. cinderella, very pale,\\nbeckoned us in.\\n\\n“she is safe?” demanded poirot.\\n\\n“yes, i was just in time. she was exhausted.”\\n\\nmrs. renauld was half sitting, half lying on the bed. she was gasping\\nfor breath.\\n\\n“nearly strangled me,” she murmured painfully. the girl picked up\\nsomething from the floor and handed it to poirot. it was a rolled up\\nladder of silk rope, very fine but quite strong.\\n\\n“a getaway,” said poirot. “by the window, whilst we were battering at\\nthe door. where is—the other?”\\n\\nthe girl stood aside a little and pointed. on the ground lay a figure\\nwrapped in some dark material a fold of which hid the face.\\n\\n“dead?”\\n\\nshe nodded.\\n\\n“i think so.”\\n\\n“head must have struck the marble fender.”\\n\\n“but who is it?” i cried.\\n\\n“the murderer of m. renauld, hastings. and the would-be murderer of\\nmadame renauld.”\\n\\npuzzled and uncomprehending, i knelt down, and lifting the fold of\\ncloth, looked into the dead beautiful face of marthe daubreuil!\\n\\n\\n\\n28 journey’s end\\n\\ni have confused memories of the further events of that night. poirot\\nseemed deaf to my repeated questions. he was engaged in overwhelming\\nfrançoise with reproaches for not having told him of mrs. renauld’s\\nchange of sleeping quarters.\\n\\ni caught him by the shoulder, determined to attract his attention, and\\nmake myself heard.\\n\\n“but you _must___ have known,” i expostulated. “you were taken up to\\nsee her this afternoon.”\\n\\npoirot deigned to attend to me for a brief moment.\\n\\n“she had been wheeled on a sofa into the middle room—her boudoir,” he\\nexplained.\\n\\n“but, monsieur,” cried françoise, “madame changed her room almost\\nimmediately after the crime! the associations—they were too\\ndistressing!”\\n\\n“then why was i not told,” vociferated poirot, striking the table, and\\nworking himself into a first-class passion. “i demand\\nyou—why—was—i—not—told? you are an old woman completely imbecile! and\\nléonie and denise are no better. all of you are triple idiots! your\\nstupidity has nearly caused the death of your mistress. but for this\\ncourageous child—”\\n\\nhe broke off, and, darting across the room to where the girl was\\nbending over ministering to mrs. renauld, he embraced her with gallic\\nfervour—slightly to my annoyance.\\n\\ni was aroused from my condition of mental fog by a sharp command from\\npoirot to fetch the doctor immediately on mrs. renauld’s behalf. after\\nthat, i might summon the police. and he added, to complete my dudgeon:\\n\\n“it will hardly be worth your while to return here. i shall be too busy\\nto attend to you, and of mademoiselle here i make a _garde-malad___.”\\n\\ni retired with what dignity i could command. having done my errands, i\\nreturned to the hotel. i understood next to nothing of what had\\noccurred. the events of the night seemed fantastic and impossible.\\nnobody would answer my questions. nobody had seemed to hear them.\\nangrily, i flung myself into bed, and slept the sleep of the bewildered\\nand utterly exhausted.\\n\\ni awoke to find the sun pouring in through the open windows and poirot,\\nneat and smiling, sitting beside the bed.\\n\\n“_enfin___ you wake! but it is that you are a famous sleeper, hastings!\\ndo you know that it is nearly eleven o’clock?”\\n\\ni groaned and put a hand to my head.\\n\\n“i must have been dreaming,” i said. “do you know, i actually dreamt\\nthat we found marthe daubreuil’s body in mrs. renauld’s room, and that\\nyou declared her to have murdered mr. renauld?”\\n\\n“you were not dreaming. all that is quite true.”\\n\\n“but bella duveen killed mr. renauld?”\\n\\n“oh, no, hastings, she did not! she said she did—yes—but that was to\\nsave the man she loved from the guillotine.”\\n\\n“what?”\\n\\n“remember jack renauld’s story. they both arrived on the scene at the\\nsame instant, and each took the other to be the perpetrator of the\\ncrime. the girl stares at him in horror, and then with a cry rushes\\naway. but, when she hears that the crime has been brought home to him,\\nshe cannot bear it, and comes forward to accuse herself and save him\\nfrom certain death.”\\n\\npoirot leaned back in his chair, and brought the tips of his fingers\\ntogether in familiar style.\\n\\n“the case was not quite satisfactory to me,” he observed judicially.\\n“all along i was strongly under the impression that we were dealing\\nwith a cold-blooded and premeditated crime committed by some one who\\nhad been contented (very cleverly) with using m. renauld’s own plans\\nfor throwing the police off the track. the great criminal (as you may\\nremember my remarking to you once) is always supremely simple.”\\n\\ni nodded.\\n\\n“now, to support this theory, the criminal must have been fully\\ncognizant of mr. renauld’s plans. that leads us to madame renauld. but\\nfacts fail to support any theory of her guilt. is there any one else\\nwho might have known of them? yes. from marthe daubreuil’s own lips we\\nhave the admission that she overheard m. renauld’s quarrel with the\\ntramp. if she could overhear that, there is no reason why she should\\nnot have heard everything else, especially if m. and madame renauld\\nwere imprudent enough to discuss their plans sitting on the bench.\\nremember how easily you overheard marthe’s conversation with jack\\nrenauld from that spot.”\\n\\n“but what possible motive could marthe have for murdering mr. renauld?”\\ni argued.\\n\\n“what motive? money! m. renauld was a millionaire several times over,\\nand at his death (or so she and jack believed) half that vast fortune\\nwould pass to his son. let us reconstruct the scene from the standpoint\\nof marthe daubreuil.\\n\\n“marthe daubreuil overhears what passes between renauld and his wife.\\nso far he has been a nice little source of income to the daubreuil\\nmother and daughter, but now he proposes to escape from their toils. at\\nfirst, possibly, her idea is to prevent that escape. but a bolder idea\\ntakes its place, and one that fails to horrify the daughter of jeanne\\nberoldy! at present m. renauld stands inexorably in the way of her\\nmarriage with jack. if the latter defies his father, he will be a\\npauper—which is not at all to the mind of mademoiselle marthe. in fact,\\ni doubt if she has ever cared a straw for jack renauld. she can\\nsimulate emotion, but in reality she is of the same cold, calculating\\ntype as her mother. i doubt, too, whether she was really very sure of\\nher hold over the boy’s affections. she had dazzled and captivated him,\\nbut separated from her, as his father could so easily manage to\\nseparate him, she might lose him. but with m. renauld dead, and jack\\nthe heir to half his millions, the marriage can take place at once, and\\nat a stroke she will attain wealth—not the beggarly thousands that have\\nbeen extracted from him so far. and her clever brain takes in the\\nsimplicity of the thing. it is all so easy. m. renauld is planning all\\nthe circumstances of his death—she has only to step in at the right\\nmoment and turn the farce into a grim reality. and here comes in the\\nsecond point which led me infallibly to marthe daubreuil—the dagger!\\njack renauld had _three___ souvenirs made. one he gave to his mother,\\none to bella duveen; was it not highly probable that he had given the\\nthird one to marthe daubreuil?\\n\\n“so then, to sum up, there were four points of note against marthe\\ndaubreuil:\\n\\n“(1) marthe daubreuil could have overheard m. renauld’s plans.\\n\\n“(2) marthe daubreuil had a direct interest in causing m. renauld’s\\ndeath.\\n\\n“(3) marthe daubreuil was the daughter of the notorious madame beroldy\\nwho in my opinion was morally and virtually the murderess of her\\nhusband, although it may have been georges conneau’s hand which struck\\nthe actual blow.\\n\\n“(4) marthe daubreuil was the only person, besides jack renauld, likely\\nto have the third dagger in her possession.”\\n\\npoirot paused and cleared his throat.\\n\\n“of course, when i learned of the existence of the other girl, bella\\nduveen, i realized that it was quite possible that _she___ might have\\nkilled m. renauld. the solution did not commend itself to me, because,\\nas i pointed out to you, hastings, an expert, such as i am, likes to\\nmeet a foeman worthy of his steel. still one must take crimes as one\\nfinds them, not as one would like them to be. it did not seem very\\nlikely that bella duveen would be wandering about carrying a souvenir\\npaper-knife in her hand, but of course she might have had some idea all\\nthe time of revenging herself on jack renauld. when she actually came\\nforward and confessed to the murder, it seemed that all was over. and\\nyet—i was not satisfied, _mon ami___. _i was not satisfied.\\u200a…___\\n\\n“i went over the case again minutely, and i came to the same conclusion\\nas before. if it was _not___ bella duveen, the only other person who\\ncould have committed the crime was marthe daubreuil. but i had not one\\nsingle proof against her!\\n\\n“and then you showed me that letter from mademoiselle dulcie, and i saw\\na chance of settling the matter once for all. the original dagger was\\nstolen by dulcie duveen and thrown into the sea—since, as she thought,\\nit belonged to her sister. but if, by any chance, it was _not___ her\\nsister’s, but the one given by jack to marthe daubreuil—why then, bella\\nduveen’s dagger would be still intact! i said no word to you, hastings\\n(it was no time for romance) but i sought out mademoiselle dulcie, told\\nher as much as i deemed needful, and set her to search amongst the\\neffects of her sister. imagine my elation, when she sought me out\\n(according to my instructions) as miss robinson with the precious\\nsouvenir in her possession!\\n\\n“in the meantime i had taken steps to force mademoiselle marthe into\\nthe open. by my orders, mrs. renauld repulsed her son, and declared her\\nintention of making a will on the morrow which should cut him off from\\never enjoying even a portion of his father’s fortune. it was a\\ndesperate step, but a necessary one, and madame renauld was fully\\nprepared to take the risk—though unfortunately she also never thought\\nof mentioning her change of room. i suppose she took it for granted\\nthat i knew. all happened as i thought. marthe daubreuil made a last\\nbold bid for the renauld millions—and failed!”\\n\\n“what absolutely bewilders me,” i said, “is how she ever got into the\\nhouse without our seeing her. it seems an absolute miracle. we left her\\nbehind at the villa marguerite, we go straight to the villa\\ngeneviève—and yet she is there before us!”\\n\\n“ah, but we did not leave her behind. she was out of the villa\\nmarguerite by the back way whilst we were talking to her mother in the\\nhall. that is where, as the americans say, she ‘put it over’ on hercule\\npoirot!”\\n\\n“but the shadow on the blind? we saw it from the road.”\\n\\n“_eh bien___, when we looked up, madame daubreuil had just had time to\\nrun upstairs and take her place.”\\n\\n“madame daubreuil?”\\n\\n“yes. one is old, and one is young, one dark, and one fair, but, for\\nthe purpose of a silhouette on a blind, their profiles are singularly\\nalike. even i did not suspect—triple imbecile that i was! i thought i\\nhad plenty of time before me—that she would not try to gain admission\\nto the villa until much later. she had brains, that beautiful\\nmademoiselle marthe.”\\n\\n“and her object was to murder mrs. renauld?”\\n\\n“yes. the whole fortune would then pass to her son. but it would have\\nbeen suicide, _mon ami!___ on the floor by marthe daubreuil’s body, i\\nfound a pad and a little bottle of chloroform and a hypodermic syringe\\ncontaining a fatal dose of morphine. you understand? the chloroform\\nfirst—then when the victim is unconscious the prick of the needle. by\\nthe morning the smell of the chloroform has quite disappeared, and the\\nsyringe lies where it has fallen from madame renauld’s hand. what would\\nhe say, the excellent m. hautet? ‘poor woman! what did i tell you? the\\nshock of joy, it was too much on top of the rest! did i not say that i\\nshould not be surprised if her brain became unhinged. altogether a most\\ntragic case, the renauld case!’\\n\\n“however, hastings, things did not go quite as mademoiselle marthe had\\nplanned. to begin with, madame renauld was awake and waiting for her.\\nthere is a struggle. but madame renauld is terribly weak still. there\\nis a last chance for marthe daubreuil. the idea of suicide is at an\\nend, but if she can silence madame renauld with her strong hands, make\\na getaway with her little silk ladder whilst we are still battering on\\nthe inside of the further door, and be back at the villa marguerite\\nbefore we return there, it will be hard to prove anything against her.\\nbut she was checkmated—not by hercule poirot—but by _la petite\\nacrobate___ with her wrists of steel.”\\n\\ni mused over the whole story.\\n\\n“when did you first begin to suspect marthe daubreuil, poirot? when she\\ntold us she had overheard the quarrel in the garden?”\\n\\npoirot smiled.\\n\\n“my friend, do you remember when we drove into merlinville that first\\nday? and the beautiful girl we saw standing at the gate? you asked me\\nif i had not noticed a young goddess, and i replied to you that i had\\nseen only a girl with anxious eyes. that is how i have thought of\\nmarthe daubreuil from the beginning. _the girl with the anxious\\neyes!___ why was she anxious? not on jack renauld’s behalf, for she did\\nnot know then that he had been in merlinville the previous evening.”\\n\\n“by the way,” i exclaimed, “how is jack renauld?”\\n\\n“much better. he is still at the villa marguerite. but madame daubreuil\\nhas disappeared. the police are looking for her.”\\n\\n“was she in with her daughter, do you think?”\\n\\n“we shall never know. madame is a lady who can keep her secrets. and i\\ndoubt very much if the police will ever find her.”\\n\\n“has jack renauld been—told?”\\n\\n“not yet.”\\n\\n“it will be a terrible shock to him.”\\n\\n“naturally. and yet, do you know, hastings, i doubt if his heart was\\never seriously engaged. so far we have looked upon bella duveen as a\\nsiren, and marthe daubreuil as the girl he really loved. but i think\\nthat if we reversed the terms we should come nearer to the truth.\\nmarthe daubreuil was very beautiful. she set herself to fascinate jack,\\nand she succeeded, but remember his curious reluctance to break with\\nthe other girl. and see how he was willing to go to the guillotine\\nrather than implicate her. i have a little idea that when he learns the\\ntruth he will be horrified—revolted, and his false love will wither\\naway.”\\n\\n“what about giraud?”\\n\\n“he has a _crise___ of the nerves, that one! he has been obliged to\\nreturn to paris.”\\n\\nwe both smiled.\\n\\npoirot proved a fairly true prophet. when at length the doctor\\npronounced jack renauld strong enough to hear the truth, it was poirot\\nwho broke it to him. the shock was indeed terrific. yet jack rallied\\nbetter than i could have supposed possible. his mother’s devotion\\nhelped him to live through those difficult days. the mother and son\\nwere inseparable now.\\n\\nthere was a further revelation to come. poirot had acquainted mrs.\\nrenauld with the fact that he knew her secret, and had represented to\\nher that jack should not be left in ignorance of his father’s past.\\n\\n“to hide the truth, never does it avail, madame! be brave and tell him\\neverything.”\\n\\nwith a heavy heart mrs. renauld consented, and her son learned that the\\nfather he had loved had been in actual fact a fugitive from justice. a\\nhalting question was promptly answered by poirot.\\n\\n“reassure yourself, m. jack. the world knows nothing. as far as i can\\nsee, there is no obligation for me to take the police into my\\nconfidence. throughout the case i have acted, not for them, but for\\nyour father. justice overtook him at last, but no one need ever know\\nthat he and georges conneau were one and the same.”\\n\\nthere were, of course, various points in the case that remained\\npuzzling to the police, but poirot explained things in so plausible a\\nfashion that all query about them was gradually stilled.\\n\\nshortly after we got back to london, i noticed a magnificent model of a\\nfoxhound adorning poirot’s mantelpiece. in answer to my inquiring\\nglance, poirot nodded.\\n\\n“_mais, oui!___ i got my 500 francs! is he not a splendid fellow? i\\ncall him giraud!”\\n\\na few days later jack renauld came to see us with a resolute expression\\non his face.\\n\\n“m. poirot, i’ve come to say good-bye. i’m sailing for south america\\nalmost immediately. my father had large interests over the continent,\\nand i mean to start a new life out there.”\\n\\n“you go alone, m. jack?”\\n\\n“my mother comes with me—and i shall keep stonor on as my secretary. he\\nlikes out of-the-way parts of the world.”\\n\\n“no one else goes with you?”\\n\\njack flushed.\\n\\n“you mean—?”\\n\\n“a girl who loves you very dearly—who has been willing to lay down her\\nlife for you.”\\n\\n“how could i ask her?” muttered the boy. “after all that has happened,\\ncould i go to her and—oh, what sort of a lame story could i tell?”\\n\\n“_les femmes___—they have a wonderful genius for manufacturing crutches\\nfor stories like that.”\\n\\n“yes, but—i’ve been such a damned fool!”\\n\\n“so have all of us, at one time and another,” observed poirot\\nphilosophically.\\n\\nbut jack’s face had hardened.\\n\\n“there’s something else. i’m my father’s son. would any one marry me,\\nknowing that?”\\n\\n“you are your father’s son, you say. hastings here will tell you that i\\nbelieve in heredity—”\\n\\n“well, then—”\\n\\n“wait. i know a woman, a woman of courage and endurance, capable of\\ngreat love, of supreme self-sacrifice—”\\n\\nthe boy looked up. his eyes softened.\\n\\n“my mother!”\\n\\n“yes. you are your mother’s son as well as your father’s. go then to\\nmademoiselle bella. tell her everything. keep nothing back—and see what\\nshe will say!”\\n\\njack looked irresolute.\\n\\n“go to her as a boy no longer, but a man—a man bowed by the fate of the\\npast, and the fate of today, but looking forward to a new and wonderful\\nlife. ask her to share it with you. you may not realize it, but your\\nlove for each other has been tested in the fire and not found wanting.\\nyou have both been willing to lay down your lives for each other.”\\n\\nand what of captain arthur hastings, humble chronicler of these pages?\\n\\nthere is some talk of his joining the renaulds on a ranch across the\\nseas, but for the end of this story i prefer to go back to a morning in\\nthe garden of the villa geneviève.\\n\\n“i can’t call you bella,” i said, “since it isn’t your name. and dulcie\\nseems so unfamiliar. so it’s got to be cinderella. cinderella married\\nthe prince, you remember. i’m not a prince, but—”\\n\\nshe interrupted me.\\n\\n“cinderella warned him, i’m sure! you see, she couldn’t promise to turn\\ninto a princess. she was only a little scullion after all—”\\n\\n“it’s the prince’s turn to interrupt,” i interpolated. “do you know\\nwhat he said?”\\n\\n“no?”\\n\\n“\\u200a‘hell!’ said the prince—and kissed her!”\\n\\nand i suited the action to the word.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nend of project
